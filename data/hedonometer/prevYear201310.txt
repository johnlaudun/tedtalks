So I want to start by offering you a free no tech life hack  and all it requires of you is this  that you change your posture for two minutes. But before I give it away  I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body. So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller  Maybe you're hunching  crossing your legs  maybe wrapping your ankles. Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this. Sometimes we spread out.  Laughter  I see you. So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now. We're going to come back to that in a few minutes  and I'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit  it could significantly change the way your life unfolds. So  we're really fascinated with body language  and we're particularly interested in other people's body language. You know  we're interested in  like  you know    Laughter    an awkward interaction  or a smile  or a contemptuous glance  or maybe a very awkward wink  or maybe even something like a handshake. Narrator  Here they are arriving at Number   . This lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States. Here comes the Prime Minister    No.  Laughter   Applause  Amy Cuddy  So a handshake  or the lack of a handshake  can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks. Even the BBC and The New York Times. So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior  or body language    but we call it nonverbals as social scientists    it's language  so we think about communication. When we think about communication  we think about interactions. So what is your body language communicating to me  What's mine communicating to you  And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this. So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language  or other people's body language  on judgments. And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language. And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote  who we ask out on a date. For example  Nalini Ambady  a researcher at Tufts University  shows that when people watch    second soundless clips of real physician patient interactions  their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued. So it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent  but do we like that person and how they interacted  Even more dramatic  Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates' faces in just one second predict    percent of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes  and even  let's go digital  emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead to you claim more value from that negotiation. If you use them poorly  bad idea. Right  So when we think of nonverbals  we think of how we judge others  how they judge us and what the outcomes are. We tend to forget  though  the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals  and that's ourselves. We are also influenced by our nonverbals  our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology. So what nonverbals am I talking about  I'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice  and I teach at a competitive business school  so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics. I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance. And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance  Well  this is what they are. So in the animal kingdom  they are about expanding. So you make yourself big  you stretch out  you take up space  you're basically opening up. It's about opening up. And this is true across the animal kingdom. It's not just limited to primates. And humans do the same thing.  Laughter  So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically  and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment. And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are. This expression  which is known as pride  Jessica Tracy has studied. She shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition. So when they cross the finish line and they've won  it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it. They do this. So the arms up in the V  the chin is slightly lifted. What do we do when we feel powerless  We do exactly the opposite. We close up. We wrap ourselves up. We make ourselves small. We don't want to bump into the person next to us. So again  both animals and humans do the same thing. And this is what happens when you put together high and low power. So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other's nonverbals. So if someone is being really powerful with us  we tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them. We do the opposite of them. So I'm watching this behavior in the classroom  and what do I notice  I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals. So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas  really coming into the room  they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts  like they really want to occupy space. When they sit down  they're sort of spread out. They raise their hands like this. You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in. As soon they come in  you see it. You see it on their faces and their bodies  and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny  and they go like this when they raise their hand. I notice a couple of things about this. One  you're not going to be surprised. It seems to be related to gender. So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men. Women feel chronically less powerful than men  so this is not surprising. But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating  and how well they were participating. And this is really important in the MBA classroom  because participation counts for half the grade. So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap. You get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades  and it seems to be partly attributable to participation. So I started to wonder  you know  okay  so you have these people coming in like this  and they're participating. Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more  So my main collaborator Dana Carney  who's at Berkeley  and I really wanted to know  can you fake it till you make it  Like  can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful  So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us. There's a lot of evidence. But our question really was  do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves  There's some evidence that they do. So  for example  we smile when we feel happy  but also  when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this  it makes us feel happy. So it goes both ways. When it comes to power  it also goes both ways. So when you feel powerful  you're more likely to do this  but it's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful  you are more likely to actually feel powerful. So the second question really was  you know  so we know that our minds change our bodies  but is it also true that our bodies change our minds  And when I say minds  in the case of the powerful  what am I talking about  So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings  and in my case  that's hormones. I look at hormones. So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like  So powerful people tend to be  not surprisingly  more assertive and more confident  more optimistic. They actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance. They also tend to be able to think more abstractly. So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks. There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people. Physiologically  there also are differences on two key hormones  testosterone  which is the dominance hormone  and cortisol  which is the stress hormone. So what we find is that high power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol  and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol. So what does that mean  When you think about power  people tended to think only about testosterone  because that was about dominance. But really  power is also about how you react to stress. So do you want the high power leader that's dominant  high on testosterone  but really stress reactive  Probably not  right  You want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant  but not very stress reactive  the person who's laid back. So we know that in primate hierarchies  if an alpha needs to take over  if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly  within a few days  that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly. So we have this evidence  both that the body can shape the mind  at least at the facial level  and also that role changes can shape the mind. So what happens  okay  you take a role change  what happens if you do that at a really minimal level  like this tiny manipulation  this tiny intervention   For two minutes   you say   I want you to stand like this  and it's going to make you feel more powerful.  So this is what we did. We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment  and these people adopted  for two minutes  either high power poses or low power poses  and I'm just going to show you five of the poses  although they took on only two. So here's one. A couple more. This one has been dubbed the  Wonder Woman  by the media. Here are a couple more. So you can be standing or you can be sitting. And here are the low power poses. So you're folding up  you're making yourself small. This one is very low power. When you're touching your neck  you're really protecting yourself. So this is what happens. They come in  they spit into a vial  for two minutes  we say   You need to do this or this.  They don't look at pictures of the poses. We don't want to prime them with a concept of power. We want them to be feeling power. So two minutes they do this. We then ask them   How powerful do you feel   on a series of items  and then we give them an opportunity to gamble  and then we take another saliva sample. That's it. That's the whole experiment. So this is what we find. Risk tolerance  which is the gambling  we find that when you are in the high power pose condition     percent of you will gamble. When you're in the low power pose condition  only    percent  and that's a whopping significant difference. Here's what we find on testosterone. From their baseline when they come in  high power people experience about a    percent increase  and low power people experience about a    percent decrease. So again  two minutes  and you get these changes. Here's what you get on cortisol. High power people experience about a    percent decrease  and the low power people experience about a    percent increase. So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive  confident and comfortable  or really stress reactive  and feeling sort of shut down. And we've all had the feeling  right  So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves  so it's not just others  but it's also ourselves. Also  our bodies change our minds. But the next question  of course  is  can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways  This is in the lab  it's this little task  it's just a couple of minutes. Where can you actually apply this  Which we cared about  of course. And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations  like social threat situations. Where are you being evaluated  either by your friends  For teenagers  it's at the lunchroom table. For some people it's speaking at a school board meeting. It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview. We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through  was the job interview. So we published these findings  and the media are all over it  and they say  Okay  so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview  right  You know  so we were of course horrified  and said  Oh my God  no  that's not what we meant at all. For numerous reasons  no  don't do that. Again  this is not about you talking to other people. It's you talking to yourself. What do you do before you go into a job interview  You do this. You're sitting down. You're looking at your iPhone    or your Android  not trying to leave anyone out. You're looking at your notes  you're hunching up  making yourself small  when really what you should be doing maybe is this  like  in the bathroom  right  Do that. Find two minutes. So that's what we want to test. Okay  So we bring people into a lab  and they do either high  or low power poses again  they go through a very stressful job interview. It's five minutes long. They are being recorded. They're being judged also  and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback  so they look like this. Imagine this is the person interviewing you. So for five minutes  nothing  and this is worse than being heckled. People hate this. It's what Marianne LaFrance calls  standing in social quicksand.  So this really spikes your cortisol. So this is the job interview we put them through  because we really wanted to see what happened. We then have these coders look at these tapes  four of them. They're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions. They have no idea who's been posing in what pose  and they end up looking at these sets of tapes  and they say   We want to hire these people   all the high power posers.  We don't want to hire these people. We also evaluate these people much more positively overall.  But what's driving it  It's not about the content of the speech. It's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech. Because we rate them on all these variables related to competence  like  how well structured is the speech  How good is it  What are their qualifications  No effect on those things. This is what's affected. These kinds of things. People are bringing their true selves  basically. They're bringing themselves. They bring their ideas  but as themselves  with no  you know  residue over them. So this is what's driving the effect  or mediating the effect. So when I tell people about this  that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior  and our behavior can change our outcomes  they say to me   It feels fake.  Right  So I said  fake it till you make it. It's not me. I don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud. I don't want to feel like an impostor. I don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here. And that really resonated with me  because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like I'm not supposed to be here. When I was     I was in a really bad car accident. I was thrown out of a car  rolled several times. I was thrown from the car. And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward  and I had been withdrawn from college  and I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations  which was very traumatic. I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart  and I had been called gifted as a child. So I'm taken out of college  I keep trying to go back. They say   You're not going to finish college. Just  you know  there are other things for you to do  but that's not going to work out for you.  So I really struggled with this  and I have to say  having your identity taken from you  your core identity  and for me it was being smart  having that taken from you  there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that. So I felt entirely powerless. I worked and worked  and I got lucky  and worked  and got lucky  and worked. Eventually I graduated from college. It took me four years longer than my peers  and I convinced someone  my angel advisor  Susan Fiske  to take me on  and so I ended up at Princeton  and I was like  I am not supposed to be here. I am an impostor. And the night before my first year talk  and the first year talk at Princeton is a    minute talk to    people. That's it. I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said   I'm quitting.  She was like   You are not quitting  because I took a gamble on you  and you're staying. You're going to stay  and this is what you're going to do. You are going to fake it. You're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do. You're just going to do it and do it and do it  even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out of body experience  until you have this moment where you say  'Oh my gosh  I'm doing it. Like  I have become this. I am actually doing this.'  So that's what I did. Five years in grad school  a few years  you know  I'm at Northwestern  I moved to Harvard  I'm at Harvard  I'm not really thinking about it anymore  but for a long time I had been thinking   Not supposed to be here.  So at the end of my first year at Harvard  a student who had not talked in class the entire semester  who I had said   Look  you've gotta participate or else you're going to fail   came into my office. I really didn't know her at all. She came in totally defeated  and she said   I'm not supposed to be here.  And that was the moment for me. Because two things happened. One was that I realized  oh my gosh  I don't feel like that anymore. I don't feel that anymore  but she does  and I get that feeling. And the second was  she is supposed to be here  Like  she can fake it  she can become it. So I was like   Yes  you are  You are supposed to be here  And tomorrow you're going to fake it  you're going to make yourself powerful  and  you know    And you're going to go into the classroom  and you are going to give the best comment ever.  You know  And she gave the best comment ever  and people turned around and were like  oh my God  I didn't even notice her sitting there.  Laughter  She comes back to me months later  and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it  she had actually faked it till she became it. So she had changed. And so I want to say to you  don't fake it till you make it. Fake it till you become it. Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize. The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this. Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes. So  this is two minutes. Two minutes  two minutes  two minutes. Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation  for two minutes  try doing this  in the elevator  in a bathroom stall  at your desk behind closed doors. That's what you want to do. Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation. Get your testosterone up. Get your cortisol down. Don't leave that situation feeling like  oh  I didn't show them who I am. Leave that situation feeling like  I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am. So I want to ask you first  you know  both to try power posing  and also I want to ask you to share the science  because this is simple. I don't have ego involved in this.  Laughter  Give it away. Share it with people  because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power. Give it to them because they can do it in private. They need their bodies  privacy and two minutes  and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life. Thank you. Thank you very much.  Applause  Thank you. It's a distinct privilege to be here. A few weeks ago  I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets. This one entered her left hemisphere  and knocked out her Broca's area  the speech center of her brain. And in this session  Gabby's working with a speech therapist  and she's struggling to produce some of the most basic words  and you can see her growing more and more devastated  until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears  and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist. And after a few moments  her therapist tries a new tack  and they start singing together  and Gabby starts to sing through her tears  and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels  and she sings  in one descending scale  she sings   Let it shine  let it shine  let it shine.  And it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail  in this case literally speak. Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug  one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard  and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy  which has become very popular in music therapy now. Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic  could not form sentences of three  or four word sentences  but they could still sing the lyrics to a song  whether it was  Happy Birthday To You  or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones. And after    hours of intensive singing lessons  he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere's damage. When I was     I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab  and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain    how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non musicians  how music  and listening to music  could just light up the entire brain  from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum  how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism  to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression  how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music  and how late stage Alzheimer's patients  whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family  could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children. But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug  and it was this  that I was at a crossroads in my life  trying to choose between music and medicine. I had just completed my undergraduate  and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe  studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard  and I had fallen in love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon. I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes  these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis  or with children with disfiguring cancers. I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor  that doctor without borders. On the other hand  I had played the violin my entire life. Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession. It was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan  and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv  and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory  but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine. And that afternoon  I had to ask him   How was it for you making that decision   And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to  and that for me  medical school could wait  but that the violin simply would not. And after two more years of studying music  I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta.  Laughter  And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic. It was my first audition  and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week  I was offered the position. And it was a dream. It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra  to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel  but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family  my new musical home. But a year later  I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard  one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician. Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard  but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early   s  was treated with thorazine at Bellevue  and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles    years later. Nathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States  as told through the book and the movie  The Soloist   but I became his friend  and I became his violin teacher  and I told him that wherever he had his violin  and wherever I had mine  I would play a lesson with him. And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row  I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments  from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode. Playing for Nathaniel  the music took on a deeper meaning  because now it was about communication  a communication where words failed  a communication of a message that went deeper than words  that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche  yet came as a true musical offering from me. I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness  yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his  but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets  And at the very core of this crisis of mine  I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me  where somehow  perhaps possibly in a very naive sense  I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill. But in the end  it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change  if I wanted to make a difference  I already had the perfect instrument to do it  that music was the bridge that connected my world and his. There's a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann  who said   To send light into the darkness of men's hearts  such is the duty of the artist.  And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum. And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel  I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony  bringing the light of music into the very darkest places  performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row  performing for combat veterans with post traumatic stress disorder  and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane. After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino  a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face  and she had a palsy  she was shaking  and she had this gorgeous smile  and she said that she had never heard classical music before  she didn't think she was going to like it  she had never heard a violin before  but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine  and that nobody ever came to visit them  and that for the first time in six years  when she heard us play  she stopped shaking without medication. Suddenly  what we're finding with these concerts  away from the stage  away from the footlights  out of the tuxedo tails  the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room  would never have access to the kind of music that we make. Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone  the power and beauty of music transcends the  E  in the middle of our beloved acronym. Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone. The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner  or a symphony by Brahms  or chamber music by Beethoven  compels us to remember our shared  common humanity  the deeply communal connected consciousness  the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard wired into our brain's right hemisphere. And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration  the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them  to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them. And the spark of that beauty  the spark of that humanity transforms into hope  and we know  whether we choose the path of music or of medicine  that's the very first thing we must instill within our communities  within our audiences  if we want to inspire healing from within. I'd like to end with a quote by John Keats  the Romantic English poet  a very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know. Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry  but he died when he was a year older than me. And Keats said   Beauty is truth  and truth beauty. That is all ye know on Earth  and all ye need to know.  We most certainly do talk to terrorists  no question about it. We are at war with a new form of terrorism. It's sort of the good old  traditional form of terrorism  but it's sort of been packaged for the   st century. One of the big things about countering terrorism is  how do you perceive it  Because perception leads to your response to it. So if you have a traditional perception of terrorism  it would be that it's one of criminality  one of war. So how are you going to respond to it  Naturally  it would follow that you meet kind with kind. You fight it. If you have a more modernist approach  and your perception of terrorism is almost cause and effect  then naturally from that  the responses that come out of it are much more asymmetrical. We live in a modern  global world. Terrorists have actually adapted to it. It's something we have to  too  and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses have to start  in effect  putting on their Google tinted glasses  or whatever. For my part  what I wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand  say  Coca Cola. Both are fairly bad for your health.  Laughter  If you look at it as a brand in those ways  what you'll come to realize is  it's a pretty flawed product. As we've said  it's pretty bad for your health  it's bad for those who it affects  and it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either. It doesn't actually do what it says on the tin. You're not really going to get    virgins in heaven. It's not going to happen  I don't think. And you're not really going to  in the '  s  end capitalism by supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense. But what you realize  it's got an Achilles' heel. The brand has an Achilles' heel. We've mentioned the health  but it needs consumers to buy into it. The consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency. They're the people who buy into the brand  support them  facilitate them  and they're the people we've got to reach out to. We've got to attack that brand in front of them. There's two essential ways of doing that  if we carry on this brand theme. One is reducing their market. What I mean is  it's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete. We've got to show we're a better product. If I'm trying to show we're a better product  I probably wouldn't do things like Guantanamo Bay. We've talked there about curtailing the underlying need for the product itself. You could be looking there at poverty  injustice  all those sorts of things which feed terrorism. The other thing to do is to knock the product  attack the brand myth  as we've said. You know  there's nothing heroic about killing a young kid. Perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across. We've got to reveal the dangers in the product. Our target audience  it's not just the producers of terrorism  as I've said  the terrorists. It's not just the marketeers of terrorism  which is those who finance  those who facilitate it  but it's the consumers of terrorism. We've got to get in to those homelands. That's where they recruit from. That's where they get their power and strength. That's where their consumers come from. And we have to get our messaging in there. So the essentials are  we've got to have interaction in those areas  with the terrorists  the facilitators  etc. We've got to engage  we've got to educate  and we've got to have dialogue. Now  staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds  think about delivery mechanisms. How are we going to do these attacks  Well  reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society. We've got to show we're better. We've got to show our values. We've got to practice what we preach. But when it comes to knocking the brand  if the terrorists are Coca Cola and we're Pepsi  I don't think  being Pepsi  anything we say about Coca Cola  anyone's going to believe us. So we've got to find a different mechanism  and one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across is the victims of terrorism. They are somebody who can actually stand there and say   This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days. It burnt my hand  whatever.  You believe them. You can see their scars. You trust them. But whether it's victims  whether it's governments  NGOs  or even the Queen yesterday  in Northern Ireland  we have to interact and engage with those different layers of terrorism  and  in effect  we do have to have a little dance with the devil. This is my favorite part of my speech. I wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point  but    Laughter    TED  for health and safety reasons  have told me I've got to do a countdown  so I feel like a bit of an Irish or Jewish terrorist  sort of a health and safety terrorist  and I    Laughter    I've got to count          and it's a bit alarming  so thinking of what my motto would be  and it would be   Body parts  not heart attacks.  So        .  Explosion sound  Very good.  Laughter  Now  lady in   J was a suicide bomber amongst us all. We're all victims of terrorism. There's     of us in this room. We're going to be scarred for life. There was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there. The son's dead. The father lives. The father will probably kick himself for years to come that he didn't take that seat instead of his kid. He's going to take to alcohol  and he's probably going to kill himself in three years. That's the stats. There's a very young  attractive lady over here  and she has something which I think's the worst form of psychological  physical injury I've ever seen out of a suicide bombing  It's human shrapnel. What it means is  when she sat in a restaurant in years to come     years to come     years to come  or she's on the beach  every so often she's going to start rubbing her skin  and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel. And that is a hard thing for the head to take. There's a lady over there as well who lost her legs in this bombing. She's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount of money off our government for looking after what's happened to her. She had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best universities. She's going to give up university to look after Mum. We're all here  and all of those who watch it are going to be traumatized by this event  but all of you here who are victims are going to learn some hard truths. That is  our society  we sympathize  but after a while  we start to ignore. We don't do enough as a society. We do not look after our victims  and we do not enable them  and what I'm going to try and show is that actually  victims are the best weapon we have against more terrorism. How would the government at the turn of the millennium approach today  Well  we all know. What they'd have done then is an invasion. If the suicide bomber was from Wales  good luck to Wales  I'd say. Knee jerk legislation  emergency provision legislation    which hits at the very basis of our society  as we all know    it's a mistake. We're going to drive prejudice throughout Edinburgh  throughout the U.K.  for Welsh people. Today's approach  governments have learned from their mistakes. They are looking at what I've started off on  on these more asymmetrical approaches to it  more modernist views  cause and effect. But mistakes of the past are inevitable. It's human nature. The fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense. They are going to make mistakes. They're not just going to be smart. There was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up the point very beautifully. He said   The thing is  about the British government  is  is that it's got to be lucky all the time  and we only have to be lucky once.  So what we need to do is we have to effect it. We've got to start thinking about being more proactive. We need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons in this war on terrorism. But of course  it's ideas    is not something that governments do very well. I want to go back just to before the bang  to this idea of brand  and I was talking about Coke and Pepsi  etc. We see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war. They'll see it as freedom fighters and truth against injustice  imperialism  etc. We do have to see this as a deadly battlefield. It's not just  our  flesh and blood they want. They actually want our cultural souls  and that's why the brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this. If we look at al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was essentially a product on a shelf in a souk somewhere which not many people had heard of.      launched it. It was its big marketing day  and it was packaged for the   st century. They knew what they were doing. They were effectively  doing  something in this brand image of creating a brand which can be franchised around the world  where there's poverty  ignorance and injustice. We  as I've said  have got to hit that market  but we've got to use our heads rather than our might. If we perceive it in this way as a brand  or other ways of thinking at it like this  we will not resolve or counter terrorism. What I'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently. The first one has been dubbed  lawfare   for want of a better word. When we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists  everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots. Now it's got a title. Everyone's doing it. There's a bomb  people start suing. But one of the first early cases on this was the Omagh Bombing. A civil action was brought from     . In Omagh  bomb went off  Real IRA  middle of a peace process. That meant that the culprits couldn't really be prosecuted for lots of reasons  mostly to do with the peace process and what was going on  the greater good. It also meant  then  if you can imagine this  that the people who bombed your children and your husbands were walking around the supermarket that you lived in. Some of those victims said enough is enough. We brought a private action  and thank God     years later  we actually won it. There is a slight appeal on at the moment so I have to be a bit careful  but I'm fairly confident. Why was it effective  It was effective not just because justice was seen to be done where there was a huge void. It was because the Real IRA and other terrorist groups  their whole strength is from the fact that they are an underdog. When we put the victims as the underdog and flipped it  they didn't know what to do. They were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down. The bombs actually stopped    fact    because of this action. We became  or those victims became  more importantly  a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization. There's other examples. We have a case called Almog which is to do with a bank that was  allegedly  from our point of view  giving rewards to suicide bombers. Just by bringing the very action  that bank has stopped doing it  and indeed  the powers that be around the world  which for real politic reasons before  couldn't actually deal with this issue  because there was lots of competing interests  have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system. There's another case called the McDonald case  where some victims of Semtex  of the Provisional IRA bombings  which were supplied by Gaddafi  sued  and that action has led to amazing things for new Libya. New Libya has been compassionate towards those victims  and started taking it    so it started a whole new dialogue there. But the problem is  we need more and more support for these ideas and cases. Civil affairs and civil society initiatives. A good one is in Somalia. There's a war on piracy. If anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy like a war on terrorism and beat it  you're wrong. What we're trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman. They used to be fisherman  of course  but we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste in their water  so what we're trying to do is create security and employment by bringing a coastguard along with the fisheries industry  and I can guarantee you  as that builds  al Shabaab and such likes will not have the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people. These initiatives cost less than a missile  and certainly less than any soldier's life  but more importantly  it takes the war to their homelands  and not onto our shore  and we're looking at the causes. The last one I wanted to talk about was dialogue. The advantages of dialogue are obvious. It self educates both sides  enables a better understanding  reveals the strengths and weaknesses  and yes  like some of the speakers before  the shared vulnerability does lead to trust  and it does then become  that process  part of normalization. But it's not an easy road. After the bomb  the victims are not into this. There's practical problems. It's politically risky for the protagonists and for the interlocutors. On one occasion I was doing it  every time I did a point that they didn't like  they actually threw stones at me  and when I did a point they liked  they starting shooting in the air  equally not great.  Laughter  Whatever the point  it gets to the heart of the problem  you're doing it  you're talking to them. Now  I just want to end with saying  if we follow reason  we realize that I think we'd all say that we want to have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure military perception of it. We need to foster more modern and asymmetrical responses to it. This isn't about being soft on terrorism. It's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields. We must foster innovation  as I've said. Governments are receptive. It won't come from those dusty corridors. The private sector has a role. The role we could do right now is going away and looking at how we can support victims around the world to bring initiatives. If I was to leave you with some big questions here which may change one's perception to it  and who knows what thoughts and responses will come out of it  but did myself and my terrorist group actually need to blow you up to make our point  We have to ask ourselves these questions  however unpalatable. Have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian struggle somewhere in the world  What if  actually  engagement on poverty and injustice is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do  What if the bombs are just simply wake up calls for us  What happens if that bomb went off because we didn't have any thoughts and things in place to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction  What is definitely uncontroversial is that  as I've said  we've got to stop being reactive  and more proactive  and I just want to leave you with one idea  which is that it's a provocative question for you to think about  and the answer will require sympathy with the devil. It's a question that's been tackled by many great thinkers and writers  What if society actually needs crisis to change  What if society actually needs terrorism to change and adapt for the better  It's those Bulgakov themes  it's that picture of Jesus and the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane walking into the moonlight. What it would mean is that humans  in order to survive in development  quite Darwinian spirit here  inherently must dance with the devil. A lot of people say that communism was defeated by the Rolling Stones. It's a good theory. Maybe the Rolling Stones has a place in this. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you.  Applause  So  this is my grandfather  Salman Schocken  who was born into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed  and when he was    years old  he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table. He never went back to school. Instead  he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores. Salman was the consummate perfectionist  and every one of his stores was a jewel of Bauhaus architecture. He was also the ultimate self learner  and like everything else  he did it in grand style. He surrounded himself with an entourage of young  unknown scholars like Martin Buber and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka  and he paid each one of them a monthly salary so that they could write in peace. And yet  in the late '  s  Salman saw what's coming. He fled Germany  together with his family  leaving everything else behind. His department stores confiscated  he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit of art and culture. This high school dropout died at the age of     a formidable intellectual  cofounder and first CEO of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  and founder of Schocken Books  an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired by Random House. Such is the power of self study. And these are my parents. They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education. They were too busy building a family and a country. And yet  just like Salman  they were lifelong  tenacious self learners  and our home was stacked with thousands of books  records and artwork. I remember quite vividly my father telling me that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set  then we'll buy a normal F.M. radio.  Laughter  And that's me  I was going to say holding my first abacus  but actually holding what my father would consider an ample substitute to an iPad.  Laughter  So one thing that I took from home is this notion that educators don't necessarily have to teach. Instead  they can provide an environment and resources that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own. Self study  self exploration  self empowerment  these are the virtues of a great education. So I'd like to share with you a story about a self study  self empowering computer science course that I built  together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan. As you can see from the pictures  both Noam and I had an early fascination with first principles  and over the years  as our knowledge of science and technology became more sophisticated  this early awe with the basics has only intensified. So it's not surprising that  about    years ago  when Noam and I were already computer science professors  we were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon. As computers became increasingly more complex  our students were losing the forest for the trees  and indeed  it is impossible to connect with the soul of the machine if you interact with a black box P.C. or a Mac which is shrouded by numerous layers of closed  proprietary software. So Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students to understand how computers work  and understand it in the marrow of their bones  then perhaps the best way to go about it is to have them build a complete  working  general purpose  useful computer  hardware and software  from the ground up  from first principles. Now  we had to start somewhere  and so Noam and I decided to base our cathedral  so to speak  on the simplest possible building block  which is something called NAND. It is nothing more than a trivial logic gate with four input output states. So we now start this journey by telling our students that God gave us NAND    Laughter    and told us to build a computer  and when we asked how  God said   One step at a time.  And then  following this advice  we start with this lowly  humble NAND gate  and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence of projects in which they gradually build a chip set  a hardware platform  an assembler  a virtual machine  a basic operating system and a compiler for a simple  Java like language that we call  JACK.  The students celebrate the end of this tour de force by using JACK to write all sorts of cool games like Pong  Snake and Tetris. You can imagine the tremendous joy of playing with a Tetris game that you wrote in JACK and then compiled into machine language in a compiler that you wrote also  and then seeing the result running on a machine that you built starting with nothing more than a few thousand NAND gates. It's a tremendous personal triumph of going from first principles all the way to a fantastically complex and useful system. Noam and I worked five years to facilitate this ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure that will enable students to build it in one semester. And this is the great team that helped us make it happen. The trick was to decompose the computer's construction into numerous stand alone modules  each of which could be individually specified  built and unit tested in isolation from the rest of the project. And from day one  Noam and I decided to put all these building blocks freely available in open source on the Web. So chip specifications  APIs  project descriptions  software tools  hardware simulators  CPU emulators  stacks of hundreds of slides  lectures    we laid out everything on the Web and invited the world to come over  take whatever they need  and do whatever they want with it. And then something fascinating happened. The world came. And in short order  thousands of people were building our machine. And NAND Tetris became one of the first massive  open  online courses  although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called MOOCs. We just observed how self organized courses were kind of spontaneously spawning out of our materials. For example  Pramode C.E.  an engineer from Kerala  India  has organized groups of self learners who build our computer under his good guidance. And Parag Shah  another engineer  from Mumbai  has unbundled our projects into smaller  more manageable bites that he now serves in his pioneering do it yourself computer science program. The people who are attracted to these courses typically have a hacker mentality. They want to figure out how things work  and they want to do it in groups  like this hackers club in Washington  D.C.  that uses our materials to offer community courses. And because these materials are widely available and open source  different people take them to very different and unpredictable directions. For example  Yu Fangmin  from Guangzhou  has used FPGA technology to build our computer and show others how to do the same using a video clip  and Ben Craddock developed a very nice computer game that unfolds inside our CPU architecture  which is quite a complex  D maze that Ben developed using the Minecraft  D simulator engine. The Minecraft community went bananas over this project  and Ben became an instant media celebrity. And indeed  for quite a few people  taking this NAND Tetris pilgrimage  if you will  has turned into a life changing experience. For example  take Dan Rounds  who is a music and math major from East Lansing  Michigan. A few weeks ago  Dan posted a victorious post on our website  and I'd like to read it to you. So here's what Dan said.  I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me  just like literacy and numeracy  and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything  never been challenged to this degree. But given what I now feel capable of doing  I would certainly do it again. To anyone considering NAND Tetris  it's a tough journey  but you'll be profoundly changed.  So Dan demonstrates the many self learners who take this course off the Web  on their own traction  on their own initiative  and it's quite amazing because these people cannot care less about grades. They are doing it because of one motivation only. They have a tremendous passion to learn. And with that in mind  I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading. I'm sick of it. We are obsessed with grades because we are obsessed with data  and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing  and a huge part of education is about failing. Courage  according to Churchill  is the ability to go from one defeat to another without losing enthusiasm.  Laughter  And  Joyce  said that mistakes are the portals of discovery. And yet we don't tolerate mistakes  and we worship grades. So we collect your B pluses and your A minuses and we aggregate them into a number like  .   which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are. Well  in my opinion  we went too far with this nonsense  and grading became degrading. So with that  I'd like to say a few words about upgrading  and share with you a glimpse from my current project  which is different from the previous one  but it shares exactly the same characteristics of self learning  learning by doing  self exploration and community building  and this project deals with K    math education  beginning with early age math  and we do it on tablets because we believe that math  like anything else  should be taught hands on. So here's what we do. Basically  we developed numerous mobile apps  every one of them explaining a particular concept in math. So for example  let's take area. When you deal with a concept like area    well  we also provide a set of tools that the child is invited to experiment with in order to learn. So if area is what interests us  then one thing which is natural to do is to tile the area of this particular shape and simply count how many tiles it takes to cover it completely. And this little exercise here gives you a first good insight of the notion of area. Moving along  what about the area of this figure  Well  if you try to tile it  it doesn't work too well  does it. So instead  you can experiment with these different tools here by some process of guided trial and error  and at some point you will discover that one thing that you can do among several legitimate transformations is the following one. You can cut the figure  you can rearrange the parts  you can glue them and then proceed to tile just like we did before. Now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure  so a six year old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram. We don't replace teachers  by the way. We believe that teachers should be empowered  not replaced. Moving along  what about the area of a triangle  So after some guided trial and error  the child will discover  with or without help  that he or she can duplicate the original figure and then take the result  transpose it  glue it to the original and then proceed  with  what we did before  cut  rearrange  paste   oops  paste and glue  and tile. Now this transformation has doubled the area of the original figure  and therefore we have just learned that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle divided by two. But we discovered it by self exploration. So  in addition to learning some useful geometry  the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated science strategies  like reduction  which is the art of transforming a complex problem into a simple one  or generalization  which is at the heart of any scientific discipline  or the fact that some properties are invariant under some transformations. And all this is something that a very young child can pick up using such mobile apps. So presently  we are doing the following  First of all  we are decomposing the K    math curriculum into numerous such apps. And because we cannot do it on our own  we've developed a very fancy authoring tool that any author  any parent or actually anyone who has an interest in math education  can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps on tablets without programming. And finally  we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem that will match different learners with different apps according to their evolving learning style. The driving force behind this project is my colleague Shmulik London  and  you see  just like Salman did about    years ago  the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people  because at the end  it's all about people. And a few years ago  I was walking in Tel Aviv and I saw this graffiti on a wall  and I found it so compelling that by now I preach it to my students  and I'd like to try to preach it to you. Now  I don't know how many people here are familiar with the term  mensch.  It basically means to be human and to do the right thing. And with that  what this graffiti says is   High tech schmigh tech. The most important thing is to be a mensch.   Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  When I was considering a career in the art world  I took a course in London  and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian called Pietro  who drank too much  smoked too much and swore much too much. But he was a passionate teacher  and I remember one of our earlier classes with him  he was projecting images on the wall  asking us to think about them  and he put up an image of a painting. It was a landscape with figures  semi dressed  drinking wine. There was a nude woman in the lower foreground  and on the hillside in the back  there was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus  and he said   What is this   And I    no one else did  so I put up my hand  and I said   It's a Bacchanal by Titian.  He said   It's a what   I thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong.  It's a Bacchanal by Titian.  He said   It's a what   I said   It's a Bacchanal by Titian.   Laughter  He said   You boneless bookworm  It's a fucking orgy   As I said  he swore too much. There was an important lesson for me in that. Pietro was suspicious of formal art training  art history training  because he feared that it filled people up with jargon  and then they just classified things rather than looking at them  and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary  and he wanted us to use our eyes  and he was especially evangelical about this message  because he was losing his sight. He wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects. What is it  How is it made  Why was it made  How is it used  And these were important lessons to me when I subsequently became a professional art historian. My kind of eureka moment came a few years later  when I was studying the art of the courts of Northern Europe  and of course it was very much discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day. But as I began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions  I found there was a kind of a missing component  for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries. Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and  really  well into the   th century  and it was pretty apparent why. Tapestries were portable. You could roll them up  send them ahead of you  and in the time it took to hang them up  you could transform a cold  dank interior into a richly colored setting. Tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated  or even themselves  and in addition to that  tapestries were hugely expensive. They required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials    the wools  the silks  even gold and silver thread. So  all in all  in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare  tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda. Well  I became a tapestry historian. In due course  I ended up as a curator at the Metropolitan Museum  because I saw the Met as one of the few places where I could organize really big exhibitions about the subject I cared so passionately about. And in about       the then director Philippe de Montebello gave me the go ahead to organize an exhibition for     . We normally have these very long lead in times. It wasn't straightforward. It's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car. They have to be wound on huge rollers  shipped in oversized freighters. Some of them are so big we had  to get them into the museum  we had to take them up the great steps at the front. We thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience  the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded  the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread  the labeling. You know  we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs  a one hit image. These were big  complex things  almost like cartoons with multiple narratives. We had to draw our audience in  get them to slow down  to explore the objects. There was a lot of skepticism. On the opening night  I overheard one of the senior members of staff saying   This is going to be a bomb.  But in reality  in the course of the coming weeks and months  hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show. The exhibition was designed to be an experience  and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs. So I want you to use your imaginations  thinking of these wall high objects  some of them    meters wide  depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today  thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer  violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism. I remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time  and all the little boys  they kind of    you know  they were little boys  and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground    Laughter    kind of an in your face joke by the artist. And you can just imagine them. But it brought it alive to them. I think they suddenly saw that these weren't just old faded tapestries. These were images of the world in the past  and that it was the same for our audience. And for me as a curator  I felt proud. I felt I'd shifted the needle a little. Through this experience that could only be created in a museum  I'd opened up the eyes of my audience    historians  artists  press  the general public    to the beauty of this lost medium. A few years later  I was invited to be the director of the museum  and after I got over that     Who  me  The tapestry geek  I don't wear a tie      I realized the fact  I believe passionately in that curated museum experience. We live in an age of ubiquitous information  and sort of  just add water  expertise  but there's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well told narrative  what the curator does  the interpretation of a complex  esoteric subject  in a way that retains the integrity of the subject  that makes it    unpacks it for a general audience. And that  to me  today  is now the challenge and the fun of my job  supporting the vision of my curators  whether it's an exhibition of Samurai swords  early Byzantine artifacts  Renaissance portraits  or the show we heard mentioned earlier  the McQueen show  with which we enjoyed so much success last summer. That was an interesting case. In the late spring  early summer of       shortly after McQueen's suicide  our curator of costume  Andrew Bolton  came to see me  and said   I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen  and now is the moment. We have to  we have to do it fast.  It wasn't easy. McQueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy  but Andrew went to London and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence  and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows  which were works of performance art in their own right  and we proceeded to do something at the museum  I think  we've never done before. It wasn't just your standard installation. In fact  we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings  a recreation of his first studio  a hall of mirrors  a curiosity box  a sunken ship  a burned out interior  with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating. And in this extraordinary setting  the costumes were like actors and actresses  or living sculptures. It could have been a train wreck. It could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue at Christmas  but because of the way that Andrew connected with the McQueen team  he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of McQueen  and the show was quite transcendant  and it became a phenomenon in its own right. By the end of the show  we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show  but no one really complained. I heard over and over again   Wow  that was worth it. It was a such a visceral  emotive experience.  Now  I've described two very immersive exhibitions  but I also believe that collections  individual objects  can also have that same power. The Met was set up not as a museum of American art  but of an encyclopedic museum  and today      years later  that vision is as prescient as ever  because  of course  we live in a world of crisis  of challenge  and we're exposed to it through the      newsreels. It's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations  the cultures  that we're seeing the current manifestation of. Whether it's Libya  Egypt  Syria  it's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding. I mean  our new Islamic galleries are a case in point  opened    years  almost to the week  after     . I think for most Americans  knowledge of the Islamic world was pretty slight before       and then it was thrust upon us in one of America's darkest hours  and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event. Now  in our galleries  we show    centuries of the development of different Islamic cultures across a vast geographic spread  and  again  hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last October. I'm often asked   Is digital media replacing the museum   and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion. I mean  don't get me wrong  I'm a huge advocate of the Web. It gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe  but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship. Bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time  across space  whose lives may have been very different to our own  but who  like us  had hopes and dreams  frustrations and achievements in their lives. And I think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves  helps us make better decisions about where we're going. The Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world  awe inspiring  like a medieval cathedral. From there  you can walk in any direction to almost any culture. I frequently go out into the hall and the galleries and I watch our visitors coming in. Some of them are comfortable. They feel at home. They know what they're looking for. Others are very uneasy. It's an intimidating place. They feel that the institution is elitist. I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism. I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind  where they're prepared to be a little bit lost  to explore  to see the unfamiliar in the familiar  or to try the unknown. Because for us  it's all about bringing them face to face with great works of art  capturing them at that moment of discomfort  when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone  your Blackberry  but to create a zone where their curiosity can expand. And whether it's in the expression of a Greek sculpture that reminds you of a friend  or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry  or  to bring it back to my tutor Pietro  those dancing figures who are indeed knocking back the wine  and that nude figure in the left foreground. Wow. She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality. In that moment  our scholarship can tell you that this is a bacchanal  but if we're doing our job right  and you've checked the jargon at the front door  trust your instinct. You know it's an orgy. Thank you.  Applause  Companies are losing control. What happens on Wall Street no longer stays on Wall Street. What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube.  Laughter  Reputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle. Management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff.  Laughter  A recent survey said that    percent of bosses believe their employees are inspired by their firm. However  in the same survey  only four percent of employees agreed. Companies are losing control of their customers and their employees. But are they really  I'm a marketer  and as a marketer  I know that I've never really been in control. Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room  the saying goes. Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now      . They can listen and join the conversation. In fact  they have more control over the loss of control than ever before. They can design for it. But how  First of all  they can give employees and customers more control. They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas  knowledge  content  designs and product. They can give them more control over pricing  which is what the band Radiohead did with its pay as you like online release of its album  In Rainbows.  Buyers could determine the price  but the offer was exclusive  and only stood for a limited period of time. The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band. The Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg opened a so called  generous store  in Copenhagen. It asked customers to purchase chocolate with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones. It turned transactions into interactions  and generosity into a currency. Companies can even give control to hackers. When Microsoft Kinect came out  the motion controlled add on to its Xbox gaming console  it immediately drew the attention of hackers. Microsoft first fought off the hacks  but then shifted course when it realized that actively supporting the community came with benefits. The sense of co ownership  the free publicity  the added value  all helped drive sales. The ultimate empowerment of customers is to ask them not to buy. Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyers to check out eBay for its used products and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones. In an even more radical stance against consumerism  the company placed a  Don't Buy This Jacket  advertisement during the peak of shopping season. It may have jeopardized short term sales  but it builds lasting  long term loyalty based on shared values. Research has shown that giving employees more control over their work makes them happier and more productive. The Brazilian company Semco Group famously lets employees set their own work schedules and even their salaries. Hulu and Netflix  among other companies  have open vacation policies. Companies can give people more control  but they can also give them less control. Traditional business wisdom holds that trust is earned by predictable behavior  but when everything is consistent and standardized  how do you create meaningful experiences  Giving people less control might be a wonderful way to counter the abundance of choice and make them happier. Take the travel service Nextpedition. Nextpedition turns the trip into a game  with surprising twists and turns along the way. It does not tell the traveler where she's going until the very last minute  and information is provided just in time. Similarly  Dutch airline KLM launched a surprise campaign  seemingly randomly handing out small gifts to travelers en route to their destination. U.K. based Interflora monitored Twitter for users who were having a bad day  and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers. Is there anything companies can do to make their employees feel less pressed for time  Yes. Force them to help others. A recent study suggests that having employees complete occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day increases their sense of overall productivity. At Frog  the company I work for  we hold internal speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees  helping them get to know each other fast. By applying a strict process  we give them less control  less choice  but we enable more and richer social interactions. Companies are the makers of their fortunes  and like all of us  they are utterly exposed to serendipity. That should make them more humble  more vulnerable and more human. At the end of the day  as hyperconnectivity and transparency expose companies' behavior in broad daylight  staying true to their true selves is the only sustainable value proposition. Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said   What's interesting about you is you.  For the true selves of companies to come through  openness is paramount  but radical openness is not a solution  because when everything is open  nothing is open.  A smile is a door that is half open and half closed   the author Jennifer Egan wrote. Companies can give their employees and customers more control or less. They can worry about how much openness is good for them  and what needs to stay closed. Or they can simply smile  and remain open to all possibilities. Thank you.  Applause  I have to say that I'm very glad to be here. I understand we have over    countries here  so that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries. In each country  I'm sure you have this thing called the parent teacher conference. Do you know about the parent teacher conference  Not the ones for your kids  but the one you had as a child  where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents  and it's a little bit awkward. Well  I remember in third grade  I had this moment where my father  who never takes off from work  he's a classical blue collar  a working class immigrant person  going to school to see his son  how he's doing  and the teacher said to him  he said   You know  John is good at math and art.  And he kind of nodded  you know  The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store  and he said   You know  John's good at math.  And that always stuck with me all my life. Why didn't Dad say art  Why wasn't it okay  Why  It became a question my entire life  and that's all right  because being good at math meant he bought me a computer  and some of you remember this computer  this was my first computer. Who had an Apple II  Apple II users  very cool.  Applause  As you remember  the Apple II did nothing at all.  Laughter  You'd plug it in  you'd type in it and green text would come out. It would say you're wrong most of the time. That was the computer we knew. That computer is a computer that I learned about going to MIT  my father's dream. And at MIT  however  I learned about the computer at all levels  and after  I went to art school to get away from computers  and I began to think about the computer as more of a spiritual space of thinking. And I was influenced by performance art    so this is    years ago. I made a computer out of people. It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment. I have a power manager  mouse driver  memory  etc.  and I built this in Kyoto  the old capital of Japan. It's a room broken in two halves. I've turned the computer on  and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard  and it's put into the computer. And the floppy disk drive person wears it.  Laughter  She finds the first sector on the disk  and takes data off the disk and passes it off to  of course  the bus. So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory  to the CPU  the VRAM  etc.  and it's an actual working computer. That's a bus  really.  Laughter  And it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver  where it's XY.  Laughter  It looks like it's happening kind of quickly  but it's actually a very slow computer  and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is  it made me wonder about computers and technology in general. And so I'm going to talk today about four things  really. The first three things are about how I've been curious about technology  design and art  and how they intersect  how they overlap  and also a topic that I've taken on since four years ago I became the President of Rhode Island School of Design  leadership. And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis  a kind of experiment. So starting from technology  technology is a wonderful thing. When that Apple II came out  it really could do nothing. It could show text and after we waited a bit  we had these things called images. Remember when images were first possible with a computer  those gorgeous  full color images  And then after a few years  we got CD quality sound. It was incredible. You could listen to sound on the computer. And then movies  via CD ROM. It was amazing. Remember that excitement  And then the browser appeared. The browser was great  but the browser was very primitive  very narrow bandwidth. Text first  then images  we waited  CD quality sound over the Net  then movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible. And then the mobile phone occurred  text  images  audio  video. And now we have iPhone  iPad  Android  with text  video  audio  etc. You see this little pattern here  We're kind of stuck in a loop  perhaps  and this sense of possibility from computing is something I've been questioning for the last    or so years  and have looked to design  as we understand most things  and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine. And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson. Designers talk about the relationship between form and content  content and form. Now what does that mean  Well  content is the word up there  fear. It's a four letter word. It's a kind of a bad feeling word  fear. Fear is set in Light Helvetica  so it's not too stressful  and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica  it's like   Oh  fear  who cares   Right   Laughter  You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big  and like  whoa  that hurts. Fear. So you can see how you change the scale  you change the form. Content is the same  but you feel differently. You change the typeface to  like  this typeface  and it's kind of funny. It's like pirate typeface  like Captain Jack Sparrow typeface. Arr  Fear  Like  aww  that's not fearful. That's actually funny. Or fear like this  kind of a nightclub typeface.  Laughter  Like  we gotta go to Fear.  Laughter  It's  like  amazing  right   Laughter   Applause  It just changes the same content. Or you make it    The letters are separated apart  they're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic  and you feel sorry for the letters  like  I feel the fear. You feel for them. Or you change the typeface to something like this. It's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant  Fear. I can never get in there.  Laughter  It's just amazing  Fear. But that's form  content. If you just change one letter in that content  you get a much better word  much better content  free.  Free  is a great word. You can serve it almost any way. Free bold feels like Mandela free. It's like  yes  I can be free. Free even light feels kind of like  ah  I can breathe in free. It feels great. Or even free spread out  it's like  ah  I can breathe in free  so easily. And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove  and I have  like  Don Draper free.  Laughter  So you see that    form  content  design  it works that way. It's a powerful thing. It's like magic  almost  like the magicians we've seen at TED. It's magic. Design does that. And I've been curious about how design and technology intersect  and I'm going to show you some old work I never really show anymore  to give you a sense of what I used to do. So    yeah. So I made a lot of work in the '  s. This was a square that responds to sound. People ask me why I made that. It's not clear.  Laughter  But I thought it'd be neat for the square to respond to me  and my kids were small then  and my kids would play with these things  like   Aaah   you know  they would say   Daddy  aaah  aaah.  You know  like that. We'd go to a computer store  and they'd do the same thing. And they'd say   Daddy  why doesn't the computer respond to sound   And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound  So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time. And then I spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this  and I stopped doing it because my students at MIT got so much better than myself  so I had to hang up my mouse. But in '    I made my last piece. It was in black and white  monochrome  fully monochrome  all in integer mathematics. It's called  Tap  Type  Write.  It's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary. It has    variations.  Typing noise  There's a shift. Ten variations. This is  like  spin the letter around. This is  like  a ring of letters.  Typing noises  This is    years old  so it's kind of a    Let's see  this is   I love the French film  The Red Balloon.  Great movie  right  I love that movie. So  this is sort of like a play on that.  Typing noises   Typewriter bell  It's peaceful  like that.  Laughter  I'll show this last one. This is about balance  you know. It's kind of stressful typing out  so if you type on this keyboard  you can  like  balance it out. If you hit G  life's okay  so I always say   Hit G  and it's going to be all right. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. So that was    years ago  and I was always on the periphery of art. By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art  and art is a wonderful thing  fine art  pure art. You know  when people say   I don't get art. I don't get it at all.  That means art is working  you know  It's like  art is supposed to be enigmatic  so when you say  like   I don't get it   like  oh  that's great.  Laughter  Art does that  because art is about asking questions  questions that may not be answerable. At RISD  we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has        samples of animal  bone  mineral  plants. You know  in Rhode Island  if an animal gets hit on the road  they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it. And why do we have this facility  Because at RISD  you have to look at the actual animal  the object  to understand its volume  to perceive it. At RISD  you're not allowed to draw from an image. And many people ask me  John  couldn't you just digitize all this  Make it all digital  Wouldn't it be better  And I often say  well  there's something good to how things used to be done. There's something very different about it  something we should figure out what is good about how we did it  even in this new era. And I have a good friend  he's a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa. He's based in London  no  actually it's in Tokyo  but when he was based in London  he had a game with his wife. He would go to antique shops  and the game was as such  When we look at an antique we want  we'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique  and if it's a good story  we'll buy it. So they'd go to an antique shop  and they'd look at this cup  and they'd say   Tell us about this cup.  And the shopkeeper would say   It's old.   Laughter   Tell us more.   Oh  it's really old.   Laughter  And he saw  over and over  the antique's value was all about it being old. And as a new media artist  he reflected  and said  you know  I've spent my whole career making new media art. People say   Wow  your art  what is it   It's new media. And he realized  it isn't about old or new. It's about something in between. It isn't about  old   the dirt   new   the cloud. It's about what is good. A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at. You see it in all interesting art today  in all interesting businesses today. How we combine those two together to make good is very interesting. So art makes questions  and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions. We aren't functioning so easily anymore. We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore. As an example of authoritarianism  I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg  at a national monument  and I saw this sign that says   Do Not Walk On The Grass   and I thought  oh  I mean  I speak English  and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair. But I found a sign for Russian speaking people  and it was the best sign ever to say no. It was like   No swimming  no hiking  no anything.  My favorite ones are  no plants.  Why would you bring a plant to a national monument  I'm not sure. And also  no love.   Laughter  So that is authoritarianism. And what is that  structurally  It's a hierarchy. We all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today  but as we know  it's been disrupted. It is now a network instead of a perfect tree. It's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward. And so today  leaders are faced with how to lead differently  I believe. This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont on creative leadership. What can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead  Because in many senses  a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes. Someone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes. A traditional leader is always wanting to be right  whereas a creative leader hopes to be right. And this frame is important today  in this complex  ambiguous space  and artists and designers have a lot to teach us  I believe. And I had a show in London recently where my friends invited me to come to London for four days to sit in a sandbox  and I said great. And so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight  six hours every day  six minute appointments with anyone in London  and that was really bad. But I would listen to people  hear their issues  draw in the sand  try to figure things out  and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing. You know  It's all these one on one meetings for like four days. And it felt kind of like being president  actually. I was like   Oh  this my job. President. I do a lot of meetings  you know   And by the end of the experience  I realized why I was doing this. It's because leaders  what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen  and in that room I found so many connections between people across all of London  and so leadership  connecting people  is the great question today. Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy  it's a wonderful design challenge. And one thing I've been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective. Let me show you something I haven't shown anywhere  actually. So what this is  is a kind of a sketch  an application sketch I wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop  This is called Powershop  and the way it works is imagine an organization. You know  the CEO isn't ever at the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization. There may be different subdivisions in the organization  and you might want to look into different areas. For instance  green are areas doing well  red are areas doing poorly. You know  how do you  as the leader  scan  connect  make things happen  So for instance  you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there  and know that you know someone in Eco  over here  and these people here are in Eco  the people you might engage with as CEO  people going across the hierarchy. And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find connections across areas  and so you might look in R D  and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest  and it's a person important to engage. So you might want to  for instance  get a heads up display on how you're interacting with them. How many coffees do you have  How often are you calling them  emailing them  What is the tenor of their email  How is it working out  Leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy. You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso  the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis. What is the tenor of your communications  So these kind of systems  I believe  are important. They're targeted social media systems around leaders. And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design  because art and design lets you think like this  find different systems like this  and I've just begun thinking like this  so I'm glad to share that with you. So in closing  I want to thank all of you for your attention. Thanks very much.  Applause  One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness  so if it was one  two  three  four  it's you  sir. You. Yeah.  Laughter  With the weird teeth. And you next to him.  Laughter  You know who you are. Actually  that whole row isn't right.  Laughter  That's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me.  Laughter  I am one of the one in four. Thank you. I think I inherit it from my mother  who  used to crawl around the house on all fours. She had two sponges in her hand  and then she had two tied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent.  Laughter  And she would crawl around behind me going   Who brings footprints into a building    So that was kind of a clue that things weren't right. So before I start  I would like to thank the makers of Lamotrigine  Sertraline  and Reboxetine  because without those few simple chemicals  I would not be vertical today. So how did it start  My mental illness    well  I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness. What am I going to talk about  Okay. I always dreamt that  when I had my final breakdown  it would be because I had a deep Kafkaesque existentialist revelation  or that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it.  Laughter  But that's not what happened. I had my breakdown during my daughter's sports day. There were all the parents sitting in a parking lot eating food out of the back of their car    only the English    eating their sausages. They loved their sausages.  Laughter  Lord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac  and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running  and all the mummies went   Run  Run Chlamydia  Run    Laughter   Run like the wind  Veruca  Run   And all the girlies  girlies running  running  running  everybody except for my daughter  who was just standing at the starting line  just waving  because she didn't know she was supposed to run. So I took to my bed for about a month  and when I woke up I found I was institutionalized  and when I saw the other inmates  I realized that I had found my people  my tribe.  Laughter  Because they became my only friends  they became my friends  because very few people that I knew    Well  I wasn't sent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean  if I had had a broken leg or I was with child I would have been inundated  but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up. Perk up. Because I didn't think of that.  Laughter  Because  you know  the one thing  one thing that you get with this disease  this one comes with a package  is you get a real sense of shame  because your friends go   Oh come on  show me the lump  show me the x rays   and of course you've got nothing to show  so you're  like  really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking   I'm not being carpet bombed. I don't live in a township.  So you start to hear these abusive voices  but you don't hear one abusive voice  you hear about a thousand            abusive voices  like if the Devil had Tourette's  that's what it would sound like. But we all know in here  you know  there is no Devil  there are no voices in your head. You know that when you have those abusive voices  all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic  I want to kill myself  kind of chemical  and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape  you might have yourself depression. Oh  and that's not even the tip of the iceberg. If you get a little baby  and you abuse it verbally  its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow  so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic. If a soldier sees his friend blown up  his brain goes into such high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words  so he just feels the horror over and over again. So here's my question. My question is  how come when people have mental damage  it's always an active imagination  How come every other organ in your body can get sick and you get sympathy  except the brain  I'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain  because I know you like that here at TED  so if you just give me a minute here  okay. Okay  let me just say  there's some good news. There is some good news. First of all  let me say  we've come a long  long way. We started off as a teeny  teeny little one celled amoeba  tiny  just sticking onto a rock  and now  voila  the brain. Here we go.  Laughter  This little baby has a lot of horsepower. It comes completely conscious. It's got state of the art lobes. We've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world. We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world. Here we've got a little bit of long term memory  so  you know that night you want to forget  when you got really drunk  Bye bye  Gone.  Laughter  So actually  it's filled with     billion neurons just zizzing away  electrically transmitting information  zizzing  zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here. I don't know if you can get that here.  Laughter  So  zizzing away  and so    Laughter    And for every one   I know  I drew this myself. Thank you. For every one single neuron  you can actually have from        to         different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it  and every time you learn something  or you have an experience  that bush grows  you know  that bush of information. Can you imagine  every human being is carrying that equipment  even Paris Hilton   Laughter  Go figure. But I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news. This isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four. We are not equipped for the   st century. Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth  and for people who say  oh  they're having a nice day  they're perfectly fine  they're more insane than the rest of us. Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitches in evolution. Okay  let me just explain this to you. When we were ancient man    Laughter    millions of years ago  and we suddenly felt threatened by a predator  okay     Laughter    we would   Thank you. I drew these myself.  Laughter  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Anyway  we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol  and then we'd kill or be killed  we'd eat or we'd be eaten  and then suddenly we'd de fuel  and we'd go back to normal. Okay. So the problem is  nowadays  with modern man   Laughter    when we feel in danger  we still fill up with our own chemical but because we can't kill traffic wardens    Laughter    or eat estate agents  the fuel just stays in our body over and over  so we're in a constant state of alarm  a constant state. And here's another thing that happened. About         years ago  when language came online  we started to put words to this constant emergency  so it wasn't just   Oh my God  there's a saber toothed tiger   which could be  it was suddenly   Oh my God  I didn't send the email. Oh my God  my thighs are too fat. Oh my God  everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party   So you've got this nagging loop tape that goes over and over again that drives you insane  so  you see what the problem is  What once made you safe now drives you insane. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news  but somebody has to be. Your pets are happier than you are.  Laughter  So kitty cat  meow  happy happy happy  human beings  screwed.  Laughter  Completely and utterly    so  screwed. But my point is  if we don't talk about this stuff  and we don't learn how to deal with our lives  it's not going to be one in four. It's going to be four in four who are really  really going to get ill in the upstairs department. And while we're at it  can we please stop the stigma  Thank you.  Applause  Five years ago  I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland. Penn State asked me  a communications teacher  to teach a communications class for engineering students. And I was scared.  Laughter  Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big  unfamiliar words. But as these conversations unfolded  I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world. That's just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students. I was amazed at the ideas that they had  and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well. And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication. We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world. Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges  from energy to environment to health care  among others  and if we don't know about it and understand it  then the work isn't done  and I believe it's our responsibility as non scientists to have these interactions. But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland. So scientists and engineers  please  talk nerdy to us. I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging. First question to answer for us  so what  Tell us why your science is relevant to us. Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae  but tell me that you study trabeculae  which is the mesh like structure of our bones because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis. And when you're describing your science  beware of jargon. Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas. Sure  you can say  spatial and temporal   but why not just say  space and time   which is so much more accessible to us  And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down. Instead  as Einstein said  make everything as simple as possible  but no simpler. You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas. A few things to consider are having examples  stories and analogies. Those are ways to engage and excite us about your content. And when presenting your work  drop the bullet points. Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points   Laughter  What do bullets do  Bullets kill  and they will kill your presentation. A slide like this is not only boring  but it relies too much on the language area of our brain  and causes us to become overwhelmed. Instead  this example slide by Genevieve Brown is much more effective. It's showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower. And the trick here is to use a single  readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost  and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's being described. So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering. And because the engineers that I've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd  I want to summarize with an equation.  Laughter  Take your science  subtract your bullet points and your jargon  divide by relevance  meaning share what's relevant to the audience  and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you're doing  and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding. And so  scientists and engineers  when you've solved this equation  by all means  talk nerdy to me.  Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  In       I met in Florence a professor  Carlo Pedretti  my former professor of art history  and today a world renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci. Well  he asked me if I could find some technological way to unfold a five centuries old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci  the  Battle of Anghiari   which is supposed to be located in the Hall of the     in Palazzo Vecchio  in Florence. Well  in the mid '  s  there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me  especially in Italy  and so I decided  with some researchers from the United States and the University of Florence  to start probing the murals decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the     searching for the lost Leonardo. Unfortunately  at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking  because we had to go much deeper in  and so the research came to a halt  and it was only taken up in      thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family. Well  this time  we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the Hall of the     was before the remodeling  and the so called Sala Grande  which was built in       and to find out the original doors  windows  and in order to do that  we first created a  D model  and then  with thermography  we went on to discover hidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall of the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height of the ceiling  and we managed to reconstruct  therefore  all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came Vasari  and restructured the whole thing  including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place  The Battle of Anghiari  on a specific area of one of the two walls. Well  we also learned that Vasari  who was commissioned to remodel the Hall of the     between      and      by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family  we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap. One that we  see  here  Masaccio  the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence  so we just said  well maybe  Visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo  since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci. And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap. And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall  an air gap  and that's where we believe  The Battle of Anghiari   or at least the part that we know has been painted  which is called  The Fight for the Standard   should be located. Well  from there  unfortunately  in       the project came to a halt. Many political reasons. So I decided to go back to my alma mater  and  at the University of California  San Diego  and I proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage. And in       we created CISA  as a research center for cultural heritage  specifically art  architecture and archaeology. So students started to flow in  and we started to build technologies  because that's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork. We came back in the Hall of the     in       and this time  with a great group of students  and my colleague  Professor Falko Kuester  who is now the director at CISA   and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left. Well  we were confined though  limited  I should rather say  for several reasons that it's not worth explaining  to endoscopy only  of the many other options we had  and with a  mm camera attached to it  we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color  black color  and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams  XRF  X ray diffraction  and the results are very positive so far. It seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments  and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before Vasari came in about    years later  well  those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to Leonardo. Well  we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind. As a matter of fact  this is by far the most important commission that Leonardo has ever had  and for doing this great masterpiece  he was named the number one artist influence at the time. I had also had the privilege since the last    years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me  but basically to do what  Well  to assess  for example  the state of conservation. See here the face of the Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it you suddenly see another  different lady  aged lady  I should rather say. There is a lot of varnish still sitting there  several retouches  and some over cleaning. It becomes very visible. But also  technology has helped to write new pages of our history  or at least to update pages of our histories. For example  the  Lady with the Unicorn   another painting by Rafael  well  you see the unicorn. A lot has been said and written about the unicorn  but if you take an X ray of the unicorn  it becomes a puppy dog. And    Laughter    no problem  but  unfortunately  continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn  did not paint the puppy dog  actually left the painting unfinished  so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn    Laughter    unfortunately  is not very reliable.  Laughter  Well  also  authenticity. Just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution to say the least  but also  I would say  a market revolution  let me add. Take this example  Otto Marseus  nice painting  which is  Still Life  at the Pitti Gallery  and just have an infrared camera peering through  and luckily for art historians  it just was confirmed that there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says when it was made and also the location. So that was a good result. Sometimes  it's not that good  and so  again  authenticity and science could go together and change the way  not attributions being made  but at least lay the ground for a more objective  or  I should rather say  less subjective attribution  as it is done today. But I would say the discovery that really caught my imagination  my admiration  is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer  brown layer  of  The Adoration of the Magi.  Here you see a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it  and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath. Well  this happens to be the most important painting we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci  and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries. Look at these portraits. They're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work. You see the geniality of his creation  right directly on the ground layer of the panel  and see this cool thing  finding  I should rather say  an elephant.  Laughter  Because of this elephant  over    new images came out  never seen for centuries. This was an epiphany. We came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by Leonardo da Vinci  which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see  so thanks only to technology. Well  the tablet. Well  we thought  well  if we all have this pleasure  this privilege to see all this  to find all these discoveries  what about for everybody else  So we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet. Let me show you just simulating what we could be doing  any of us could be doing  in a museum environment. So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet  okay  And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see  like this. Okay  And I will just click on it  we pause  and now let me turn to you so the moment the image  or  I should say  the camera  has locked in the painting  then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded. And so  see. We can  as we said  we can zoom in. Then we can scroll. Okay  Let's go and find the elephant. So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off and we see the elephant.  Applause  Okay  And then if we want  we can continue the scroll to find out  for example  on the staircase  the whole iconography is going to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple  and there are a lot of figures showing up. See  This is not just a curiosity  because it changes not just the iconography as you see it  but the iconology  the meaning of the painting  and we believe this is a cool way  easy way  that everybody could have access to  to become more the protagonist of your own discovery  and not just be so passive about it  as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums. Another concept is the digital clinical chart  which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients  but when we talk about works of art  unfortunately  it's never been tapped as an idea. Well  we believe  again  that this should be the beginning  the very first step  to do real conservation  and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation  the technique  materials  and also if  when  and why we should restore  or  rather  to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting. Well  our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance  create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together. We definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values  these cultural values that we badly need  especially today. And if you want to summarize in one just single word  well  this is what we're trying to do. We're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future. As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion  there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you.  Applause  Over the past six months  I've spent my time traveling. I think I've done        miles  but without leaving my desk. And the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people. I look like one person but I'm two people. I'm Eddie who is here  and at the same time  my alter ego is a big green boxy avatar nicknamed Cyber Frank. So that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start  if it's possible  with a test  because I do business stuff  so it's important that we focus on outcomes. And then I struggled  because I was thinking to myself   What should I talk  What should I do  It's a TED audience. It's got to be stretching. How am I going to make      So I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right. So let's just walk our way through this. Please could you work this through with me  You can shout out the answer if you like. The question is  which of these horizontal lines is longer  The answer is  Audience  The same.Eddie Obeng  The same. No  they're not the same.  Laughter  They're not the same. The top one is    percent longer than the bottom one. So why did you tell me they were the same  Do you remember when we were kids at school  about that big  they played the same trick on us  It was to teach us parallax. Do you remember  And you got  you said   It's the same   And you got it wrong. You remember  And you learned the answer  and you've carried this answer in your head for                years  The answer is the same. The answer is the same. So when you're asked what the lengths are  you say they're the same  but they're not the same  because I've changed it. And this is what I'm trying to explain has happened to us in the   st century. Somebody or something has changed the rules about how our world works. When I'm joking  I try and explain it happened at midnight  you see  while we were asleep  but it was midnight    years ago. Okay  You didn't notice it  But basically  what they do is  they switched all the rules round  so that the way to successfully run a business  an organization  or even a country  has been deleted  flipped  and it's a completely new   you think I'm joking  don't you   there's a completely new set of rules in operation.  Laughter  Did you notice that  I mean  you missed this one. You probably   No  you didn't. Okay.  Laughter  My simple idea is that what's happened is  the real   st century around us isn't so obvious to us  so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize  but which no longer exists. You don't believe me  do you  Okay.  Applause  So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand. If you search Amazon for the word  creativity   you'll discover something like        books. If you go on Google and you look for  innovation   creativity   you get    million hits. If you add the word  consultants   it doubles to    million.  Laughter  Are you with me  And yet  statistically  what you discover is that about one in         ideas is found making money or delivering benefits two years after its inception. It makes no sense. Companies make their expensive executives spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published. How is that possible  If you look at the visions we have  the visions of how we're going to change the world  the key thing is implementation. We have the vision. We've got to make it happen. We've spent decades professionalizing implementation. People are supposed to be good at making stuff happen. However  if I use as an example a family of five going on holiday  if you can imagine this  all the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong  what I want you to think about is their budget is only       pounds of expenses. What actually happens is  if I compare this to the average real project  average real successful project  the family actually end up in Makassar  South Sulawesi  at a cost of       pounds  whilst leaving two of the children behind.  Laughter  What I'm trying to explain to you is  there are things which don't make sense to us. It gets even worse than that. Let me just walk you through this one. This is a quote  and I'll just pick words out of it. It says    I'll put on the voice     In summary  your Majesty  the failure to foresee the timing  extent and severity of the crisis was due to the lack of creativity and the number of bright minds   or something like that. This was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England when she asked the question   Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming    Laughter  I'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood.  Laughter  That's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is  these are eminent economists  some of the smartest people on the planet. Do you see the challenge   Laughter  It's scary. My friend and mentor  Tim Brown of IDEO  he explains that design must get big  and he's right. He wisely explains this to us. He says design thinking must tackle big systems for the challenges we have. He's absolutely right. And then I ask myself   Why was it ever small   Isn't it weird  You know  if collaboration is so cool  is cross functional working is so amazing  why did we build these huge hierarchies  What's going on  You see  I think what's happened  perhaps  is that we've not noticed that change I described earlier. What we do know is that the world has accelerated. Cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light. Technology accelerates things exponentially. So if this is now  and that's the past  and we start thinking about change  you know  all governments are seeking change  you're here seeking change  everybody's after change  it's really cool.  Laughter  So what happens is  we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change. The speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing. At the same time  as we've done that  we've done something really weird. We've doubled the population in    years  put half of them in cities  then connected them all up so they can interact. The density of the interaction of human beings is amazing. There are charts which show all these movements of information. That density of information is amazing. And then we've done a third thing. you know  for those of you who have as an office a little desk underneath the stairs  and you say  well this is my little desk under the stairs  no  You are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you're connected to the Internet. What's happened is  we've changed the scale. Size and scale are no longer the same. And then add to that  every time you tweet  over a third of your followers follow from a country which is not your own. Global is the new scale. We know that. And so people say things like   The world is now a turbulent place.  Have you heard them saying things like that  And they use it as a metaphor. Have you come across this  And they think it's a metaphor  but this is not a metaphor. It's reality. As a young engineering student  I remember going to a demonstration where they basically  the demonstrator did something quite intriguing. What he did was  he got a transparent pipe   have you seen this demonstration before    he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was  you had a situation where   I'll try and draw the tap and the pipe  actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard. Okay  So I'll write the word  tap.  Is that okay  It's a tap.  Laughter  Okay  so he attaches it to a transparent pipe  and he turns the water on. And he says  do you notice anything  And the water is whooshing down this pipe. I mean  this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me  So the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great. And he says   Anything you notice   No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe  and he connects this to a container  and he fills the container up with green ink. You with me  So guess what happens  A thin green line comes out as it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting. And then he turns the water up a bit  so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes. So he's changing the flow of the water  but it's just a boring green line. He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens. There's this little flicker  and then as he turns it ever so slightly more  the whole of that green line disappears  and instead there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle. They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink so that it actually gets diluted out  and the color's gone. What's happened in this world of pipe is somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent. All the rules are gone. In that environment  instantly  all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available  and it's not the same as laminar. And if we didn't have that green ink  you'd never notice. And I think this is our challenge  because somebody has actually increased   and it's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff   the speed  the scale and the density of interaction. Now how do we cope and deal with that  Well  we could just call it turbulence  or we could try and learn. Yes  learn  but I know you guys grew up in the days when there were actually these things called correct answers  because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle  and you believe it will last forever. So I'll put a little line up here which represents learning  and that's how we used to do it. We could see things  understand them  take the time to put them into practice. Out here is the world. Now  what's happened to our pace of learning as the world has accelerated  Well  if you work for a corporation  you'll discover it's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of  isn't in the strategy  and anyway  you've got to go through your monthly meetings. If you work in an institution  one day you will get them to make that decision. And if you work in a market where people believe in cycles  it's even funnier  because you have to wait all the way for the cycle to fail before you go   There's something wrong.  You with me  So it's likely that the line  in terms of learning  is pretty flat. You with me  This point over here  the point at which the lines cross over  the pace of change overtakes the pace of learning  and for me  that is what I was describing when I was telling you about midnight. So what does it do to us  Well  it completely transforms what we have to do  many mistakes we make. We solve last year's problems without thinking about the future. If you try and think about it  the things you're solving now  what problems are they going to bring in the future  If you haven't understood the world you're living in  it's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you're going to deliver fits. I'll give you an example  a quick one. Creativity and ideas  I mentioned that earlier. All the CEOs around me  my clients  they want innovation  so they seek innovation. They say to people   Take risks and be creative   But unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air. Entering their ears  what they hear is   Do crazy things and then I'll fire you.  Why   Laughter  Because   Why  Because in the old world  okay  in the old world  over here  getting stuff wrong was unacceptable. If you got something wrong  you'd failed. How should you be treated  Well  harshly  because you could have asked somebody who had experience. So we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for        years  are you with me  The answer is  don't do things which are different. And then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn't work. You see  in reality  there are two ways you can fail in our new world. One  you're doing something that you should follow a procedure to  and it's a very difficult thing  you're sloppy  you get it wrong. How should you be treated  You should probably be fired. On the other hand  you're doing something new  no one's ever done before  you get it completely wrong. How should you be treated  Well  free pizzas  You should be treated better than the people who succeed. It's called smart failure. Why  Because you can't put it on your C.V. So what I want to leave you  then  is with the explanation of why I actually traveled        miles from my desk. When I realized the power of this new world  I quit my safe teaching job  and set up a virtual business school  the first in the world  in order to teach people how to make this happen  and I used some of my learnings about some of the rules which I'd learned on myself. If you're interested  worldaftermidnight.com  you'll find out more  but I've applied them to myself for over a decade  and I'm still here  and I still have my house  and the most important thing is  I hope I've done enough to inject a little green ink into your lives  so that when you go away and you're making your next absolutely sensible and rational decision  you'll take some time to think   Hmm  I wonder whether this also makes sense in our new world after midnight.  Thank you very much. Thank you  thank you.  Applause  So I have bad news  I have good news  and I have a task. So the bad news is that we all get sick. I get sick. You get sick. And every one of us gets sick  and the question really is  how sick do we get  Is it something that kills us  Is it something that we survive  Is it something that we can treat  And we've gotten sick as long as we've been people. And so we've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick. And for a long time  it was the gods  right  The gods are angry with me  or the gods are testing me  right  Or God  singular  more recently  is punishing me or judging me. And as long as we've looked for explanations  we've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science  which is hypotheses as to why we get sick  and as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick  we've tried to treat it as well. So this is Avicenna. He wrote a book over a thousand years ago called  The Canon of Medicine   and the rules he laid out for testing medicines are actually really similar to the rules we have today  that the disease and the medicine must be the same strength  the medicine needs to be pure  and in the end we need to test it in people. And so if you put together these themes of a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing  right  you get some beautiful results  even when we didn't have very good technologies. This is a guy named Carlos Finlay. He had a hypothesis that was way outside the box for his time  in the late     s. He thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing. He thought it was transmitted by mosquitos. And they laughed at him. For    years  they called this guy  the mosquito man.  But he ran an experiment in people  right  He had this hypothesis  and he tested it in people. So he got volunteers to go move to Cuba and live in tents and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever. So some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes and some of the people were in tents that were full of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever. And it definitively proved that it wasn't this magic dust called fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever. But it wasn't until we tested it in people that we actually knew. And this is what those people signed up for. This is what it looked like to have yellow fever in Cuba at that time. You suffered in a tent  in the heat  alone  and you probably died. But people volunteered for this. And it's not just a cool example of a scientific design of experiment in theory. They also did this beautiful thing. They signed this document  and it's called an informed consent document. And informed consent is an idea that we should be very proud of as a society  right  It's something that separates us from the Nazis at Nuremberg  enforced medical experimentation. It's the idea that agreement to join a study without understanding isn't agreement. It's something that protects us from harm  from hucksters  from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical study that we don't understand  or that we don't agree to. And so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis  experimentation in humans  and informed consent  and you get what we call clinical study  and it's how we do the vast majority of medical work. It doesn't really matter if you're in the north  the south  the east  the west. Clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate  so if we're going to look at a new drug  right  we test it in people  we draw blood  we do experiments  and we gain consent for that study  to make sure that we're not screwing people over as part of it. But the world is changing around the clinical study  which has been fairly well established for tens of years if not    to     years. So now we're able to gather data about our genomes  but  as we saw earlier  our genomes aren't dispositive. We're able to gather information about our environment. And more importantly  we're able to gather information about our choices  because it turns out that what we think of as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies  our genomes  our choices and our environment. And the clinical methods that we've got aren't very good at studying that because they are based on the idea of person to person interaction. You interact with your doctor and you get enrolled in the study. So this is my grandfather. I actually never met him  but he's holding my mom  and his genes are in me  right  His choices ran through to me. He was a smoker  like most people were. This is my son. So my grandfather's genes go all the way through to him  and my choices are going to affect his health. The technology between these two pictures cannot be more different  but the methodology for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period. We just have better statistics. The way we gain informed consent was formed in large part after World War II  around the time that picture was taken. That was    years ago  and the way we gain informed consent  this tool that was created to protect us from harm  now creates silos. So the data that we collect for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's trials goes into silos where it can only be used for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's research. Right  It can't be networked. It can't be integrated. It cannot be used by people who aren't credentialed. So a physicist can't get access to it without filing paperwork. A computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork. Computer scientists aren't patient. They don't file paperwork. And this is an accident. These are tools that we created to protect us from harm  but what they're doing is protecting us from innovation now. And that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point. Right  It's a side effect  if you will  of a power we created to take us for good. And so if you think about it  the depressing thing is that Facebook would never make a change to something as important as an advertising algorithm with a sample size as small as a Phase III clinical trial. We cannot take the information from past trials and put them together to form statistically significant samples. And that sucks  right  So    percent of men develop cancer. Thirty eight percent of women develop cancer. One in four men dies of cancer. One in five women dies of cancer  at least in the United States. And three out of the four drugs we give you if you get cancer fail. And this is personal to me. My sister is a cancer survivor. My mother in law is a cancer survivor. Cancer sucks. And when you have it  you don't have a lot of privacy in the hospital. You're naked the vast majority of the time. People you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you  and when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used  especially when only three to four percent of people who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study  their reaction is not   Thank you  God  for protecting my privacy.  It's outrage that we have this information and we can't use it. And it's an accident. So the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous. Two hundred and twenty six billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States. Fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States. And it's getting worse. So the good news is that some things have changed  and the most important thing that's changed is that we can now measure ourselves in ways that used to be the dominion of the health system. So a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust. I like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid. We can reach back and grab that dust  and we can learn a lot about health from it  so if our choices are part of our health  what we eat is a really important aspect of our health. So you can do something very simple and basic and take a picture of your food  and if enough people do that  we can learn a lot about how our food affects our health. One interesting thing that came out of this   this is an app for iPhones called The Eatery   is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier than other people's pizza is. Okay   Laughter  And it seems like a trivial result  but this is the sort of research that used to take the health system years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish. It was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people. I don't have any financial interest in it. But more nontrivially  we can get our genotypes done  and although our genotypes aren't dispositive  they give us clues. So I could show you mine. It's just A's  T's  C's and G's. This is the interpretation of it. As you can see  I carry a    percent risk of prostate cancer     percent risk of psoriasis and a    percent risk of Alzheimer's disease. So that means  if you're a geneticist  you're freaking out  going   Oh my God  you told everyone you carry the ApoE E  allele. What's wrong with you   Right  When I got these results  I started talking to doctors  and they told me not to tell anyone  and my reaction is   Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease   And no one could tell me yes. And I live in a web world where  when you share things  beautiful stuff happens  not bad stuff. So I started putting this in my slide decks  and I got even more obnoxious  and I went to my doctor  and I said   I'd like to actually get my bloodwork. Please give me back my data.  So this is my most recent bloodwork. As you can see  I have high cholesterol. I have particularly high bad cholesterol  and I have some bad liver numbers  but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine the night before we ran the test.  Laughter  Right. But look at how non computable this information is. This is like the photograph of my granddad holding my mom from a data perspective  and I had to go into the system and get it out. So the thing that I'm proposing we do here is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust  that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype  and we reach into the medical system and we grab our records  and we use it to build something together  which is a commons. And there's been a lot of talk about commonses  right  here  there  everywhere  right. A commons is nothing more than a public good that we build out of private goods. We do it voluntarily  and we do it through standardized legal tools. We do it through standardized technologies. Right. That's all a commons is. It's something that we build together because we think it's important. And a commons of data is something that's really unique  because we make it from our own data. And although a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control around data  and obsess around privacy  at least some of us really like to share as a form of control  and what's remarkable about digital commonses is you don't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough to generate something massive and beautiful. So not that many programmers write free software  but we have the Apache web server. Not that many people who read Wikipedia edit  but it works. So as long as some people like to share as their form of control  we can build a commons  as long as we can get the information out. And in biology  the numbers are even better. So Vanderbilt ran a study asking people  we'd like to take your biosamples  your blood  and share them in a biobank  and only five percent of the people opted out. I'm from Tennessee. It's not the most science positive state in the United States of America.  Laughter  But only five percent of the people wanted out. So people like to share  if you give them the opportunity and the choice. And the reason that I got obsessed with this  besides the obvious family aspects  is that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians  and mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data because they can use it to tease signals out of noise. And those correlations that they can tease out  they're not necessarily causal agents  but math  in this day and age  is like a giant set of power tools that we're leaving on the floor  not plugged in in health  while we use hand saws. If we have a lot of shared genotypes  and a lot of shared outcomes  and a lot of shared lifestyle choices  and a lot of shared environmental information  we can start to tease out the correlations between subtle variations in people  the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices  and there's open source infrastructure to do all of this. Sage Bionetworks is a nonprofit that's built a giant math system that's waiting for data  but there isn't any. So that's what I do. I've actually started what we think is the world's first fully digital  fully self contributed  unlimited in scope  global in participation  ethically approved clinical research study where you contribute the data. So if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust  if you reach into your body and grab your genome  if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record  you can actually go through an online informed consent process    because the donation to the commons must be voluntary and it must be informed    and you can actually upload your information and have it syndicated to the mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research  and the goal is to get         in the first year and a million in the first five years so that we have a statistically significant cohort that you can use to take smaller sample sizes from traditional research and map it against  so that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations between the variations that make us unique and the kinds of health that we need to move forward as a society. And I've spent a lot of time around other commons. I've been around the early web. I've been around the early creative commons world  and there's four things that all of these share  which is  they're all really simple. And so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study  you're not going to see something complicated. But it's not simplistic. These things are weak intentionally  right  because you can always add power and control to a system  but it's very difficult to remove those things if you put them in at the beginning  and so being simple doesn't mean being simplistic  and being weak doesn't mean weakness. Those are strengths in the system. And open doesn't mean that there's no money. Closed systems  corporations  make a lot of money on the open web  and they're one of the reasons why the open web lives is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness of the system. And so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we've created  so you can actually come in  all you have to be is    years old  willing to sign a contract that says I'm not going to be a jerk  basically  and you're in. You can start analyzing the data. You do have to solve a CAPTCHA as well.  Laughter  And if you'd like to build corporate structures on top of it  that's okay too. That's all in the consent  so if you don't like those terms  you don't come in. It's very much the design principles of a commons that we're trying to bring to health data. And the other thing about these systems is that it only takes a small number of really unreasonable people working together to create them. It didn't take that many people to make Wikipedia Wikipedia  or to keep it Wikipedia. And we're not supposed to be unreasonable in health  and so I hate this word  patient.  I don't like being patient when systems are broken  and health care is broken. I'm not talking about the politics of health care  I'm talking about the way we scientifically approach health care. So I don't want to be patient. And the task I'm giving to you is to not be patient. So I'd like you to actually try  when you go home  to get your data. You'll be shocked and offended and  I would bet  outraged  at how hard it is to get it. But it's a challenge that I hope you'll take  and maybe you'll share it. Maybe you won't. If you don't have anyone in your family who's sick  maybe you wouldn't be unreasonable. But if you do  or if you've been sick  then maybe you would. And we're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there. So this is the Athena Breast Health Network. It's a study of         women in California  and they're going to return all the data to the participants of the study in a computable form  with one clickability to load it into the study that I've put together. So we'll know exactly how many people are willing to be unreasonable. So what I'd end  with  is  the most beautiful thing I've learned since I quit my job almost a year ago to do this  is that it really doesn't take very many of us to achieve spectacular results. You just have to be willing to be unreasonable  and the risk we're running is not the risk those    men who got yellow fever ran. Right  It's to be naked  digitally  in public. So you know more about me and my health than I know about you. It's asymmetric now. And being naked and alone can be terrifying. But to be naked in a group  voluntarily  can be quite beautiful. And so it doesn't take all of us. It just takes all of some of us. Thank you. Beau Lotto  So  this game is very simple. All you have to do is read what you see. Right  So  I'm going to count to you  so we don't all do it together. Okay  one  two  three.Audience  Can you read this  BL  Amazing. What about this one  One  two  three.Audience  You are not reading this. BL  All right. One  two  three.  Laughter  If you were Portuguese  right  How about this one  One  two  three. Audience  What are you reading  BL  What are you reading  There are no words there. I said  read what you're seeing. Right  It literally says   Wat ar ou rea in    Laughter  Right  That's what you should have said. Right  Why is this  It's because perception is grounded in our experience. Right  The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it  which means we never see what's there  we never see information  we only ever see what was useful to see in the past. All right  Which means  when it comes to perception  we're all like this frog. Right  It's getting information. It's generating behavior that's useful.  Laughter  BL  And sometimes  when things don't go our way  we get a little bit annoyed  right  But we're talking about perception here  right  And perception underpins everything we think  we know  we believe  our hopes  our dreams  the clothes we wear  falling in love  everything begins with perception. Now if perception is grounded in our history  it means we're only ever responding according to what we've done before. But actually  it's a tremendous problem  because how can we ever see differently  Now  I want to tell you a story about seeing differently  and all new perceptions begin in the same way. They begin with a question. The problem with questions is they create uncertainty. Now  uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator  it's too late. Okay   Laughter  Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty. Right  If you go down below on a boat  your inner ears are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes  because it's moving in register with the boat  say I'm standing still. Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information  and it gets ill. The question  why   is one of the most dangerous things you can do  because it takes you into uncertainty. And yet  the irony is  the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space. So how can we ever do anything new  Well fortunately  evolution has given us an answer  right  And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty. They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right  It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin  or what extends beyond the universe  but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space. So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty  It's play. Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you that actually it's a way of being. Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun. Right  It's adaptable to change. Right  It opens possibility  and it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding  and it's intrinsically motivated. What that means is that we play to play. Play is its own reward. Now if you look at these five ways of being  these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist. Science is not defined by the method section of a paper. It's actually a way of being  which is here  and this is true for anything that is creative. So if you add rules to play  you have a game. That's actually what an experiment is. So armed with these two ideas  that science is a way of being and experiments are play  we asked  can anyone become a scientist  And who better to ask than    eight  to    year old children  Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon  and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently  but  through the process of science  to see themselves differently. Right  The first step was to ask a question. Now  I should say that we didn't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn't make a useful contribution to science  and the teachers said kids couldn't do it. So we did it anyway. Right  Of course. So  here are some of the questions. I put them in small print so you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to    years. Right  So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists. Now here  I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right  She was one of the young people who was involved in this study  and she's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world. Right  She will now  once she comes onto stage  will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right  Now  science and asking questions is about courage. Now she is the personification of courage  because she's going to stand up here and talk to you all. So Amy  would you please come up   Applause  So Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project  and first she's going to tell you the question that they came up with. So go ahead  Amy. Amy O'Toole  Thank you  Beau. We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think  because we look alike. But we wondered if there's a possible link with other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar  since they seem so different from us. So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way. Really  we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions. So what if bees can think like us  Well  it'd be amazing  since we're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells. But it actually makes a lot of sense they should  because bees  like us  can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day  the light  the weather  or from any angle they approach it from.  Applause  BL  So the next step was to design an experiment  which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed this experiment  and so    well  game    and so  Amy  can you tell us what the game was  and the puzzle that you set the bees  AO  The puzzle we came up with was an if then rule. We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color  but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern. They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue  or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow. Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is  which  What was really exciting about this project was we  and Beau  had no idea whether it would work. It was completely new  and no one had done it before  including adults.  Laughter  BL  Including the teachers  and that was really hard for the teachers. It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing  because that's what we do in the lab  but for a teacher not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day    so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick  who was the collaborator on this project. Okay  So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it  but the next step is observation. So here are some of the students doing the observations. They're recording the data of where the bees fly. Dave Strudwick  Is she still going up here Student  Yeah. Dave Strudwick  So you keep track of each.Student  Henry  can you help me here  BL   Can you help me  Henry   What good scientist says that  right  Student  There's two up there. And three in here. BL  Right  So we've got our observations. We've got our data. They do the simple mathematics  averaging  etc.  etc. And now we want to share. That's the next step. So we're going to write this up and try to submit this for publication. Right  So we have to write it up. So we go  of course  to the pub. All right   Laughter  The one on the left is mine  okay   Laughter  Now  I tell them  a paper has four different sections  an introduction  a methods  a results  a discussion. The introduction says  what's the question and why  Methods  what did you do  Results  what was the observation  And the discussion is  who cares  Right  That's a science paper  basically.  Laughter  So the kids give me the words  right  I put it into a narrative  which means that this paper is written in kidspeak. It's not written by me. It's written by Amy and the other students in the class. As a consequence  this science paper begins   Once upon a time ...    Laughter  The results section  it says   Training phase  the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh.  Right   Laughter  And the methods  it says   Then we put the bees into the fridge  and made bee pie    smiley face. Right   Laughter  This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published. So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there. All the ones in bold are eight to    years old. The first author is Blackawton Primary School  because if it were ever referenced  it would be  Blackawton et al   and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal  and it says this. It said many things  but it said this.  I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways.   Laughter  In other words  it starts off  once upon a time   the figures are in crayon  etc.  Laughter  So we said  we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves  who is at the National Academy of Science  one of the leading neuroscientists in the world  and he says   This is the most original science paper I have ever read     Laughter     and it certainly deserves wide exposure.  Larry Maloney  expert in vision  says   The paper is magnificent. The work would be publishable if done by adults.  So what did we do  We send it back to the editor. They say no. So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists  right  putting in the references  and we submit it to Biology Letters. And there  it was reviewed by five independent referees  and it was published. Okay   Applause  It took four months to do the science  two years to get it published.  Laughter  Typical science  actually  right  So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world. What was the feedback like  Well  it was published two days before Christmas  downloaded        times in the first day  right  It was the Editors' Choice in Science  which is a top science magazine. It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters. It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal. Last year  it was the second most downloaded paper by Biology Letters  and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well. And I'll just read one.  I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now. What you guys have done is real  true and amazing. Curiosity  interest  innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science. Who else can have these qualities more than children  Please congratulate your children's team from my side.  So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor. Can I do it on you   Laughter  Oh yeah  yeah  yeah  come on. Yeah yeah. Okay. Now  science is about taking risks  so this is an incredible risk  right   Laughter  For me  not for him. Right  Because we've only done this once before.  Laughter  And you like technology  right  Shimon Schocken  Right  but I like myself. BL  This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay. Now ...  Laughter  Okay.  Laughter  Now  we're going to do a little demonstration  right  You have to close your eyes  and you have to point where you hear me clapping. All right  Okay  how about if everyone over there shouts. One  two  three  Audience   Shouts  Brilliant. Now  open your eyes. We'll do it one more time. Everyone over there shout.  Shouts  Where's the sound coming from   Laughter   Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  What's the point  The point is what science does for us. Right  We normally walk through life responding  but if we ever want to do anything different  we have to step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes  he was able to see the world in a new way. That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play  right  Now  true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice  so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story. So  Amy  AO  This project was really exciting for me  because it brought the process of discovery to life  and it showed me that anyone  and I mean anyone  has the potential to discover something new  and that a small question can lead into a big discovery. Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person feels about change. But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy. Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle  I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject  and that anyone can discover something new. You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came in the form of Beau  and the Blackawton Bee Project. Thank you.BL  Thank you very much.  Applause  Once upon a time  the world was a big  dysfunctional family. It was run by the great and powerful parents  and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children. If any of the more rowdier children questioned the authority of the parents  they were scolded. If they went exploring into the parents' rooms  or even into the secret filing cabinets  they were punished  and told that for their own good they must never go in there again. Then one day  a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents' rooms.  Look what they've been hiding from you   he said. The children looked and were amazed. There were maps and minutes from meetings where the parents were slagging each other off. They behaved just like the children. And they made mistakes  too  just like the children. The only difference was  their mistakes were in the secret filing cabinets. Well  there was a girl in the town  and she didn't think they should be in the secret filing cabinets  or if they were  there ought to be a law to allow the children access. And so she set about to make it so. Well  I'm the girl in that story  and the secret documents that I was interested in were located in this building  the British Parliament  and the data that I wanted to get my hands on were the expense receipts of members of Parliament. I thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy.  Applause  It wasn't like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker  or anything like that  but the amount of resistance I got from this Freedom of Information request  you would have thought I'd asked something like this. So I fought for about five years doing this  and it was one of many hundreds of requests that I made  not    I didn't    Hey  look  I didn't set out  honestly  to revolutionize the British Parliament. That was not my intention. I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book. But it ended up in this very long  protracted legal battle and there I was after five years fighting against Parliament in front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data. And I've got to tell you  I wasn't that hopeful  because I'd seen the establishment. I thought  it always sticks together. I am out of luck. Well  guess what  I won. Hooray.  Applause  Well  that's not exactly the story  because the problem was that Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data  and then they tried to retrospectively change the law so that it would no longer apply to them. The transparency law they'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else  they tried to keep it so it didn't apply to them. What they hadn't counted on was digitization  because that meant that all those paper receipts had been scanned in electronically  and it was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database  put it on a disk  and then just saunter outside of Parliament  which they did  and then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder  which was the Daily Telegraph  and then  you all remember  there was weeks and weeks of revelations  everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off. The end result was six ministers resigned  the first speaker of the house in     years was forced to resign  a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency      MPs stepped down at that election  and so far  four MPs and two lords have done jail time for fraud. So  thank you.  Applause  Well  I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain. It was an example of a culture clash that's happening all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged officials who think that they can rule over us without very much prying from the public  and then suddenly confronted with a public who is no longer content with that arrangement  and not only not content with it  now  more often  armed with official data itself. So we are moving to this democratization of information  and I've been in this field for quite a while. Slightly embarrassing admission  Even when I was a kid  I used to have these little spy books  and I would  like  see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down. I think that was a pretty good indication about my future career as an investigative journalist  and what I've seen from being in this access to information field for so long is that it used to be quite a niche interest  and it's gone mainstream. Everybody  increasingly  around the world  wants to know about what people in power are doing. They want a say in decisions that are made in their name and with their money. It's this democratization of information that I think is an information enlightenment  and it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment. It's about searching for the truth  not because somebody says it's true   because I say so.  No  it's about trying to find the truth based on what you can see and what can be tested. That  in the first Enlightenment  led to questions about the right of kings  the divine right of kings to rule over people  or that women should be subordinate to men  or that the Church was the official word of God. Obviously the Church weren't very happy about this  and they tried to suppress it  but what they hadn't counted on was technology  and then they had the printing press  which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply  far and fast  and people would come together in coffee houses  discuss the ideas  plot revolution. In our day  we have digitization. That strips all the physical mass out of information  so now it's almost zero cost to copy and share information. Our printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks. We're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system  and we have global decisions to make in this system  decisions about climate  about finance systems  about resources. And think about it    if we want to make an important decision about buying a house  we don't just go off. I mean  I don't know about you  but I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it. And if we're thinking about a finance system  we need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible for one person to take in the amount  the volume of information  and analyze it to make good decisions. So that's why we're seeing increasingly this demand for access to information. That's why we're starting to see more disclosure laws come out  so for example  on the environment  there's the Aarhus Convention  which is a European directive that gives people a very strong right to know  so if your water company is dumping water into your river  sewage water into your river  you have a right to know about it. In the finance industry  you now have more of a right to know about what's going on  so we have different anti bribery laws  money regulations  increased corporate disclosure  so you can now track assets across borders. And it's getting harder to hide assets  tax avoidance  pay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out more and more about these systems. And they're all moving to this central system  this fully connected system  all of them except one. Can you guess which one  It's the system which underpins all these other systems. It's the system by which we organize and exercise power  and there I'm talking about politics  because in politics  we're back to this system  this top down hierarchy. And how is it possible that the volume of information can be processed that needs to in this system  Well  it just can't. That's it. And I think this is largely what's behind the crisis of legitimacy in our different governments right now. So I've told you a bit about what I did to try and drag Parliament  kicking and screaming  into the   st century  and I'm just going to give you a couple of examples of what a few other people I know are doing. So this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He's a computer programmer  and he built a site called Alaveteli  and what it is  it's a Freedom of Information platform. It's open source  with documentation  and it allows you to make a Freedom of Information request  to ask your public body a question  so it takes all the hassle out of it  and I can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests  so it takes all of that hassle out  and you just type in your question  for example  how many police officers have a criminal record  It zooms it off to the appropriate person  it tells you when the time limit is coming to an end  it keeps track of all the correspondence  it posts it up there  and it becomes an archive of public knowledge. So that's open source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of Freedom of Information law. So there's a list there of the different countries that have it  and then there's a few more coming on board. So if any of you out there like the sound of that and have a law like that in your country  I know that Seb would love to hear from you about collaborating and getting that into your country. This is Birgitta J nsd ttir. She's an Icelandic MP. And quite an unusual MP. In Iceland  she was one of the protesters who was outside of Parliament when the country's economy collapsed  and then she was elected on a reform mandate  and she's now spearheading this project. It's the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative  and they've just got funding to make it an international modern media project  and this is taking all of the best laws around the world about freedom of expression  protection of whistleblowers  protection from libel  source protection  and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven. It's a place where your data can be free  so when we think about  increasingly  how governments want to access user data  what they're trying to do in Iceland is make this safe haven where it can happen. In my own field of investigative journalism  we're also having to start thinking globally  so this is a site called Investigative Dashboard. And if you're trying to track a dictator's assets  for example  Hosni Mubarak  you know  he's just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he's in trouble  and what you want to do to investigate that is  you need to have access to all of the world's  as many as you can  companies' house registrations databases. So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those databases into one place so you can start searching for  you know  his relatives  his friends  the head of his security services. You can try and find out how he's moving out assets from that country. But again  when it comes to the decisions which are impacting us the most  perhaps  the most important decisions that are being made about war and so forth  again we can't just make a Freedom of Information request. It's really difficult. So we're still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information  through leaks. So when the Guardian did this investigation about the Afghan War  you know  they can't walk into the Department of Defense and ask for all the information. You know  they're just not going to get it. So this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches that were written by American soldiers about the Afghan War  and leaked  and then they're able to do this investigation. Another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy. Again  this is all based around leaks          U.S. diplomatic cables  and I was involved in this investigation because I got this leak through a leak from a disgruntled WikiLeaker and ended up going to work at the Guardian. So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak. It was amazing. I mean  it was amazing. It reminded me of that scene in  The Wizard of Oz.  Do you know the one I mean  Where the little dog Toto runs across to where the wizard  is   and he pulls back  the dog's pulling back the curtain  and     Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen.  It was just like that  because what you started to see is that all of these grand statesmen  these very pompous politicians  they were just like us. They all bitched about each other. I mean  quite gossipy  those cables. Okay  but I thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp  these are human beings just like us. They don't have special powers. They're not magic. They are not our parents. Beyond that  what I found most fascinating was the level of endemic corruption that I saw across all different countries  and particularly centered around the heart of power  around public officials who were embezzling the public's money for their own personal enrichment  and allowed to do that because of official secrecy. So I've mentioned WikiLeaks  because surely what could be more open than publishing all the material  Because that is what Julian Assange did. He wasn't content with the way the newspapers published it to be safe and legal. He threw it all out there. That did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan being exposed. It also meant that the Belarussian dictator was given a handy list of all the pro democracy campaigners in that country who had spoken to the U.S. government. Is that radical openness  I say it's not  because for me  what it means  it doesn't mean abdicating power  responsibility  accountability  it's actually being a partner with power. It's about sharing responsibility  sharing accountability. Also  the fact that he threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks  I thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology  to be honest  as well.  Laughs  The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive  and you must have two real qualities  I think  when you come to the table  when you're dealing with power  talking about power  because of its seductive capacity. You've got to have skepticism and humility. Skepticism  because you must always be challenging. I want to see why do you    you just say so  That's not good enough. I want to see the evidence behind why that's so. And humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes. And if you don't have skepticism and humility  then it's a really short journey to go from reformer to autocrat  and I think you only have to read  Animal Farm  to get that message about how power corrupts people. So what is the solution  It is  I believe  to embody within the rule of law rights to information. At the moment our rights are incredibly weak. In a lot of countries  we have Official Secrets Acts  including in Britain here. We have an Official Secrets Act with no public interest test. So that means it's a crime  people are punished  quite severely in a lot of cases  for publishing or giving away official information. Now wouldn't it be amazing  and really  this is what I want all of you to think about  if we had an Official Disclosure Act where officials were punished if they were found to have suppressed or hidden information that was in the public interest  So that    yes. Yes  My power pose.  Applause   Laughs  I would like us to work towards that. So it's not all bad news. I mean  there definitely is progress on the line  but I think what we find is that the closer that we get right into the heart of power  the more opaque  closed it becomes. So it was only just the other week that I heard London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why the police need access to all of our communications  spying on us without any judicial oversight  and he said it was a matter of life and death. He actually said that  it was a matter of life and death. There was no evidence. He presented no evidence of that. It was just   Because I say so. You have to trust me. Take it on faith.  Well  I'm sorry  people  but we are back to the pre Enlightenment Church  and we need to fight against that. So he was talking about the law in Britain which is the Communications Data Bill  an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation. In America  you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. You've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance. You have the National Security Agency building the world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal    it's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol  in which they're going to intercept and analyze communications  traffic and personal data to try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society. Well  to go back to our original story  the parents have panicked. They've locked all the doors. They've kidded out the house with CCTV cameras. They're watching all of us. They've dug a basement  and they've built a spy center to try and run algorithms and figure out which ones of us are troublesome  and if any of us complain about that  we're arrested for terrorism. Well  is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare  Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't. I think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales  which are  indeed  very grim. But the world isn't a fairy tale  and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge. Equally  it could be better than we've been led to believe  but either way  we have to start seeing it exactly as it is  with all of its problems  because it's only by seeing it with all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them and live in a world in which we can all be happily ever after.  Laughs  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  To understand the world that live in  we tell stories. And while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it  all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online. But video has been left out. It arrived on the web in a small box  and there it has remained  completely disconnected from the data and the content all around it. In fact  in over a decade on the web  the only thing that has changed about video is the size of the box and the quality of the picture. Popcorn changes all of that. It's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video with content pulled live directly from the web. Videos created with Popcorn behave like the web itself  dynamic  full of links  and completely remixable  and finally allowed to break free from the frame. I want to give you a demo of a prototype that we're working on that we'll launch later this fall. It will be completely free  and it will work in any browser. So  every Popcorn production begins with the video  and so I've made a short     second clip using a newscaster template that we use in workshops. So let's watch it. We'll go back  and I'll show you how we made it. Hi  and welcome to my newscast. I've added my location with a Google Map  and it's live  so try moving it around. You can add pop ups with live links and custom icons  or pull in content from any web service  like Flickr  or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content. So let's go back  and I'll show you what you saw. There was a lot there. So this is the timeline  and if you've ever edited video  you're familiar with this  but instead of clips in the timeline  what you're looking at is web events pulled into the video. Now in this Popcorn production we've got the title card  we've got a Google Map that shows up picture in picture  then Popcorn lets it push outside the frame and take over the whole screen. There are two pop ups bringing you some other information  and a final article with a link out to the original article. Let's go to this Google Map  and I'll show you how you can edit it. All you do  go into the timeline  double click the item  and I've set it to Toronto  because that's where I'm from. Let's set it to something else. Popcorn immediately goes out onto the web  talks to Google  grabs the map  and puts it in the display. And it's exactly the same for the people who watch your production. And it's live. It's not an image. So you click on it  you zoom in  right down to street view if you want to. Now in the video  I mentioned adding a live feed  which we can do right now  so let's add a live feed from Flickr. Go over to the right hand side  grab Flickr from the list of options  drag it into the timeline  and put it where you'd like it to go  and it immediately goes out to Flickr and starts pulling in images based on the tags. Now  my developers really like ponies  and so they've set that as the default tag. Let's try something else  maybe something a bit more relevant to today. Now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed. If you come and watch this a week from now  this will be completely different  dynamic  just like the web  and just like the web  everything is sourced  so click your link  and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image. Everything you've seen today is built with the basic building blocks of the web  HTML  CSS and JavaScript. That means it's completely remixable. It also means there's no proprietary software. All you need is a web browser. So imagine if every video that we watched on the web worked like the web  completely remixable  linked to its source content  and interactive for everyone who views it. I think Popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on the web  and the way we understand the world we live in. Thank you.  Applause  I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are  how globalized we aren't  and why it's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments. And the leading point of view on this  whether measured by number of books sold  mentions in media  or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization  is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore  cross border integration is close to complete  and we live in one world. And what's interesting about this view is  again  it's a view that's held by pro globalizers like Tom Friedman  from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted  but it's also held by anti globalizers  who see this giant globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn't already done so. The other thing I would add is that this is not a new view. I'm a little bit of an amateur historian  so I've spent some time going back  trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing. And the best  earliest quote that I could find was one from David Livingstone  writing in the     s about how the railroad  the steam ship  and the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly with the rest of the world. Now clearly  David Livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time  but it does seem useful to ask ourselves   Just how global are we   before we think about where we go from here. So the best way I've found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat  may not even be close to flat  is with some data. So one of the things I've been doing over the last few years is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders  and I've looked at the cross border component as a percentage of the total. I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today  but let me just give you a few data points. I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow  one kind of flow of people  one kind of flow of capital  and  of course  trade in products and services. So let's start off with plain old telephone service. Of all the voice calling minutes in the world last year  what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross border phone calls  Pick a percentage in your own mind. The answer turns out to be two percent. If you include Internet telephony  you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent  but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate. Or let's turn to people moving across borders. One particular thing we might look at  in terms of long term flows of people  is what percentage of the world's population is accounted for by first generation immigrants  Again  please pick a percentage. Turns out to be a little bit higher. It's actually about three percent. Or think of investment. Take all the real investment that went on in the world in     . What percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment  Not quite ten percent. And then finally  the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen  the export to GDP ratio. If you look at the official statistics  they typically indicate a little bit above    percent. However  there's a big problem with the official statistics  in that if  for instance  a Japanese component supplier ships something to China to be put into an iPod  and then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S.  that component ends up getting counted multiple times. So nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is  so I thought I would ask the person who's spearheading the effort to generate data on this  Pascal Lamy  the Director of the World Trade Organization  what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of GDP  without the double  and triple counting  and it's actually probably a bit under    percent  rather than the    percent plus numbers that we're talking about. So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book   World  .    that we're very  very far from the no border effect benchmark  which would imply internationalization levels of the order of            percent. So clearly  apocalyptically minded authors have overstated the case. But it's not just the apocalyptics  as I think of them  who are prone to this kind of overstatement. I've also spent some time surveying audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guess these numbers to be. Let me share with you the results of a survey that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people's guesses along these dimensions actually were. So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide. First of all  there is a suggestion of some error. Okay.  Laughter  Second  these are pretty large errors. For four quantities whose average value is less than    percent  you have people guessing three  four times that level. Even though I'm an economist  I find that a pretty large error. And third  this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review. I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world  and in all cases except one  where a group actually underestimated the trade to GDP ratio  people have this tendency towards overestimation  and so I thought it important to give a name to this  and that's what I refer to as globaloney  the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars. Especially because  I suspect  some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims  I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney. A couple of different reasons come to mind. First of all  there's a real dearth of data in the debate. Let me give you an example. When I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called Foreign Policy  one of the people who wrote in  not entirely in agreement  was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled  Why the World Isn't Flat   that wasn't too surprising.  Laughter  What was very surprising to me was Tom's critique  which was   Ghemawat's data are narrow.  And this caused me to scratch my head  because as I went back through his several hundred page book  I couldn't find a single figure  chart  table  reference or footnote. So my point is  I haven't presented a lot of data here to convince you that I'm right  but I would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of these hand me down insights that we've been bombarded with actually are correct. So dearth of data in the debate is one reason. A second reason has to do with peer pressure. I remember  I decided to write my  Why the World Isn't Flat  article  because I was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai  and the interviewer's first question to me was   Professor Ghemawat  why do you still believe that the world is round   And I started laughing  because I hadn't come across that formulation before.  Laughter  And as I was laughing  I was thinking  I really need a more coherent response  especially on national TV. I'd better write something about this.  Laughter  But what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question. The perspective was  here is this poor professor. He's clearly been in a cave for the last        years. He really has no idea as to what's actually going on in the world. So try this out with your friends and acquaintances  if you like. You'll find that it's very cool to talk about the world being one  etc. If you raise questions about that formulation  you really are considered a bit of an antique. And then the final reason  which I mention  especially to a TED audience  with some trepidation  has to do with what I call  techno trances.  If you listen to techno music for long periods of time  it does things to your brainwave activity.  Laughter  Something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers  all political barriers  all geographic barriers  because at this point I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions  but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students  hands go up  and people ask me   Yeah  but what about Facebook   And I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook. Because  in some sense  it's the ideal kind of technology to think about. Theoretically  it makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door. What percentage of people's friends on Facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we're analyzing are based  The answer is probably somewhere between    to    percent. Non negligible  so we don't live in an entirely local or national world  but very  very far from the    percent level that you would expect  and the reason's very simple. We don't  or I hope we don't  form friendships at random on Facebook. The technology is overlaid on a pre existing matrix of relationships that we have  and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why we get far fewer than    percent of our friends being located in countries other than where we are. So does all this matter  Or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization related issues  I want to suggest that actually  globaloney can be very harmful to your health. First of all  recognizing that the glass is only    to    percent full is critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration  whereas if we thought we were already there  there would be no particular point to pushing harder. It's a little bit like  we wouldn't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference. So being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more  something that would contribute further to global welfare. Which brings me to my second point. Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization. So I actually spend most of my  World  .   book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate. I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today  so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind. Think of France and the current debate about immigration. When you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants  the answer is about    percent. That's their guess. Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue. Or to take an even more striking example  when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations did a survey of Americans  asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid  the guess was    percent  which is slightly in excess of the actual level     actually about ...       Laughter    of U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid. The reassuring thing about this particular survey was  when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data  some of them   not all of them   seemed to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid. So foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here  because if you think about it  what I've been talking about today is this notion    very uncontroversial amongst economists    that most things are very home biased.  Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people   is about the most home biased thing you can find. If you look at the OECD countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person  and compare it with how much they spend per poor person in poor countries  the ratio   Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations   turns out to be about        to one. Now of course  some of us  if we truly are cosmopolitan  would like to see that ratio being brought down to one is to one. I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are. If we simply brought that ratio down to        to one  we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio Summit    years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on. So in summary  while radical openness is great  given how closed we are  even incremental openness could make things dramatically better. Thank you very much.  Applause  In the   th century  a woman named Giulia Tofana had a very successful perfume business. For over    years she ran it. It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed    Laughter    for murdering     men. You see  it wasn't a very good perfume. In fact  it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless  but as a poison  it was the best money could buy  so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands. It turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group  because poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing. The reason is  we have sort of a built in poison detector. You can see this as early as even in newborn infants. If you are willing to do this  you can take a couple of drops of a bitter substance or a sour substance  and you'll see that face  the tongue stick out  the wrinkled nose  as if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth. This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full blown disgust response  no longer just about whether or not we're about to be poisoned  but whenever there's a threat of physical contamination from some source. But the face remains strikingly similar. It has expanded more  though  than just keeping us away from physical contaminants  and there's a growing body of evidence to suggest that  in fact  this emotion of disgust now influences our moral beliefs and even our deeply held political intuitions. Why this might be the case  We can understand this process by understanding a little bit about emotions in general. So the basic human emotions  those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings  exist because they motivate us to do good things and they keep us away from doing bad things. So by and large  they are good for our survival. Take the emotion of fear  for instance. It keeps us away from doing things that are really  really risky. This photo taken just before his death    Laughter    is actually a   No  one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this  and if they did  they would not live to tell it  because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator. Just like fear offers us protective benefits  disgust seems to do the same thing  except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us  or heights  but rather things that might poison us  or give us disease and make us sick. So one of the features of disgust that makes it such an interesting emotion is that it's very  very easy to elicit  in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions  and so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images I can probably make you feel disgust. So turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back. I mean  you see it every day  right  I mean  come on.  Laughter  Okay  turn back  if you didn't look. Those probably made a lot of you in the audience feel very  very disgusted  but if you didn't look  I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown sort of across the world to make people disgusted  things like feces  urine  blood  rotten flesh. These are the sorts of things that it makes sense for us to stay away from  because they might actually contaminate us. In fact  just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts  these things are also things that give us a lot of disgust. Darwin was probably one of the first scientists to systematically investigate the human emotions  and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength of the disgust response. This is an anecdote from his travels in South America.  In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger some cold preserved meat while I was eating ... and plainly showed disgust at its softness  whilst I felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage    Laughter    though his hands did not appear dirty.  He later wrote   It's okay  some of my best friends are naked savages.   Laughter  Well it turns out it's not only old timey British scientists who are this squeamish. I recently got a chance to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary  and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite. Richard Dawkins   We've evolved around courtship and sex  are attached to deep rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight.  David Pizarro  So my favorite part of this clip is that Professor Dawkins actually gagged. He jumps back  and he gags  and we had to do it three times  and all three times he gagged.  Laughter  And he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me  actually. One of the features  though  of disgust  is not just its universality and its strength  but the way that it works through association. So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing  that clean thing becomes disgusting  not the other way around. This makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to convince somebody that an object or an individual or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided. The philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out in this quote   Thus throughout history  certain disgust properties    sliminess  bad smell  stickiness  decay  foulness    have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ... Jews  women  homosexuals  untouchables  lower class people    all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body.  Let me give you just some examples of how  some powerful examples of how this has been used historically. This comes from a Nazi children's book published in        Just look at these guys  The louse infested beards  the filthy  protruding ears  those stained  fatty clothes... Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor. If you have a good nose  you can smell the Jews.  A more modern example comes from people who try to convince us that homosexuality is immoral. This is from an anti gay website  where they said gays are  worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices.  They're like  dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces.  These are disgust properties that are trying to be directly linked to the social group that you should not like. When we were first investigating the role of disgust in moral judgment  one of the things we became interested in was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely to work in individuals who are more easily disgusted. So while disgust  along with the other basic emotions  are universal phenomena  it just really is true that some people are easier to disgust than others. You could probably see it in the audience members when I showed you those disgusting images. The way that we measured this was by a scale that was constructed by some other psychologists that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations how likely they are to feel disgust. So here are a couple of examples.  Even if I were hungry  I would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly swatter.   Do you agree or disagree    Laughter   While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track  you smell urine. Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted   If you ask enough of these  you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity. It turns out that this score is actually meaningful. When you bring people into the laboratory and you ask them if they're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors like eating chocolate that's been baked to look like dog poop  or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross  your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not you'll be willing to engage in those behaviors. The first time that we set out to collect data on this and associate it with political or moral beliefs  we found a general pattern    this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom    that in fact  across three studies we kept finding that people who reported that they were easily disgusted also reported that they were more politically conservative. Another way to say this  though  is that people who are very liberal are very hard to disgust.  Laughter  In a more recent follow up study  we were able to look at a much greater sample  a much larger sample. In this case  this is nearly        U.S. respondents  and we find the same pattern. As you can see  people who are on the very conservative side of answering the political orientation scale are also much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted. This data set also allowed us to statistically control for a number of things that we knew were both related to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity. So we were able to control for gender  age  income  education  even basic personality variables  and the result stays the same. When we actually looked at not just self reported political orientation  but voting behavior  we were able to look geographically across the nation. What we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity  McCain got more votes. So it not only predicted self reported political orientation  but actual voting behavior. And also we were able  with this sample  to look across the world  in     different countries we asked the same questions  and as you can see  this is     countries collapsed into    different geographical regions. No matter where you look  what this is plotting is the size of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation  and no matter where we looked  we saw a very similar effect. Other labs have actually looked at this as well using different measures of disgust sensitivity  so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are  they hook people up to physiological measures  in this case skin conductance. And what they've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you. Interestingly  what they also showed in a finding that we kept getting in our previous studies as well was that one of the strongest influences here is that individuals who are very disgust sensitive not only are more likely to report being politically conservative  but they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of the socio moral issues in the sexual domain. So physiological arousal predicted  in this study  attitudes toward gay marriage. But even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity and political orientation  one of the questions that remains is what is the causal link here  Is it the case that disgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs  We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this  and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab and disgust them and compare them to a control group that hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over the past five years a number of researchers have done this  and by and large the results have all been the same  that when people are feeling disgust  their attitudes shift towards the right of the political spectrum  toward more moral conservatism as well. So this is whether you use a foul odor  a bad taste  from film clips  from post hypnotic suggestions of disgust  images like the ones I've shown you  even just reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should be wary of it and wash up  right  to keep clean  these all have similar effects on judgment. Let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted. We asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups  and we either made the room smell gross or not. When the room smelled gross  what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men. Disgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other social groups that we asked  including African Americans  the elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had toward gay men. In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people    this was at a time when the swine flu was going around    we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread of the flu that they ought to wash their hands. For some participants  we actually had them take questionnaires next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands. And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative. And when we asked them a variety of questions about the rightness or wrongness of certain acts  what we also found was that simply being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them more morally conservative. In particular  when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices  just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong. Let me give you an example of what I mean by harmless but taboo sexual practice. We gave them scenarios. One of them said a man is house sitting for his grandmother. When his grandmother's away  he has sex with his girlfriend on his grandma's bed. In another one  we said a woman enjoys masturbating with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her.  Laughter  People find these to be more morally abhorrent if they've been reminded to wash their hands.  Laughter  Okay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment should come as no surprise. I mean  that's part of how emotions work. They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways  but they change the way you think. In the case of disgust  what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence. It makes perfect sense  and it's a very good emotion for us to have  that disgust would make me change the way that I perceive the physical world whenever contamination is possible. It makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict who I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election. The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex  and might depend on exactly what judgments we're talking about  and as a scientist  we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill equipped to answer these sorts of questions. But one thing that I am fairly certain about is  at the very least  what we can do with this research is point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place. Thank you.  Applause  Having spent    years as a child of the state in children's homes and foster care  you could say that I'm an expert on the subject  and in being an expert  I want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right in light of the truth. If you're in care  legally the government is your parent  loco parentis. Margaret Thatcher was my mother.  Laughter  Let's not talk about breastfeeding.  Laughter  Harry Potter was a foster child. Pip from  Great Expectations  was adopted  Superman was a foster child  Cinderella was a foster child  Lisbeth Salander  the girl with the dragon tattoo  was fostered and institutionalized  Batman was orphaned  Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's  Northern Lights  was fostered  Jane Eyre  adopted  Roald Dahl's James from  James and the Giant Peach   Matilda  Moses    Moses   Laughter  Moses   Laughter     the boys in Michael Morpurgo's  Friend or Foe   Alem in Benjamin Zephaniah's  Refugee Boy   Luke Skywalker    Luke Skywalker   Laughter     Oliver Twist  Cassia in  The Concubine of Shanghai  by Hong Ying  Celie in Alice Walker's  The Color Purple.  All of these great fictional characters  all of them who were hurt by their condition  all of them who spawned thousands of other books and other films  all of them were fostered  adopted or orphaned. It seems that writers know that the child outside of family reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself to be. That is  they also use extraordinary skills to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis. How have we not made the connection  And why have we not made the connection  between   How has that happened    between these incredible characters of popular culture and religions  and the fostered  adopted or orphaned child in our midst  It's not our pity that they need. It's our respect. I know famous musicians  I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers  all who were looked after children  fostered  adopted or orphaned  and many of them grow into their adult lives in fear of speaking of their background  as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground  as if it were somehow Kryptonite  as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside. Children in care  who've had a life in care  deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood. It is that simple. My own mother   and I should say this here   she same to this country in the late '  s  and she was  you know  she found herself pregnant  as women did in the late '  s. You know what I mean  They found themselves pregnant. And she sort of  she had no idea of the context in which she'd landed. In the     s    I should give you some context    in the     s  if you were pregnant and you were single  you were seen as a threat to the community. You were separated from your family by the state. You were separated from your family and placed into mother and baby homes. You were appointed a social worker. The adoptive parents were lined up. It was the primary purpose of the social worker  the aim  to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life  to sign the adoption papers. So the adoption papers were signed. The mother and baby's homes were often run by nuns. The adoption papers were signed  the child was given to the adoptive parents  and the mother shipped back to her community to say that she'd been on a little break. A little break. A little break. The first secret of shame for a woman for being a woman   a little break.  The adoption process took  like  a matter of months  so it was a closed shop  you know  sealed deal  an industrious  utilitarian solution  the government  the farmer  the adopting parents  the consumer  the mother  the earth  and the child  the crop. It's kind of easy to patronize the past  to forego our responsibilities in the present. What happened then is a direct reflection of what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by God and by the state for the big society  fast tracking adoption. So anyway  she comes here        she's pregnant  and she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the Emperor Haile Selassie  and she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech  the  Rivers of Blood  speech. She lands months before the Beatles release  The White Album   months before Martin Luther King was killed. It was a summer of love if you were white. If you were black  it was a summer of hate. So she goes from Oxford  she's sent to the north of England to a mother and baby home  and appointed a social worker. It's her plan. You know  I have to say this in the Houses    It's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time while she studies. But the social worker  he had a different agenda. He found the foster parents  and he said to them   Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever. His name is Norman.   Laughter  Norman   Laughter  Norman  So they took me. I was a message  they said. I was a sign from God  they said. I was Norman Mark Greenwood. Now  for the next    years  all I know is that this woman  this birth woman  should have her eyes scratched out for not signing the adoption papers. She was an evil woman too selfish to sign  so I spent those    years kneeling and praying. I tried praying. I swear I tried praying.  God  can I have a bike for Christmas   But I would always answer myself   Yes  of course you can.  And then I was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil. And it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me. Who knew   Laughter  So anyway  two years sort of passed  and they had a child of their own  and then another two years passed  and they had another child of their own  and then another time passed and they had another child that they called an accident  which I thought was an unusual name.  Laughter  And I was on the cusp of  sort of  adolescence  so I was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking. I was starting to stay out a little bit late  etc.  etc. Now  in their religiosity  in their naivete  my mom and dad  which I believed them to be forever  as they said they were  my mom and dad conceived that I had the Devil inside of me. And what    I should say this here  because this is how they engineered my leaving. They sat me at a table  my foster mom  and she said to me   You don't love us  do you   At    years old. They've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident. And I said   Yeah  of course I do.  Because you do. My foster mother asked me to go away to think about love and what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow and give my most honest and truthful answer. So this was an opportunity. If they were asking me whether I loved them or not  then I mustn't love them  which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.  I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine through me to them. How fantastic.  This was an opportunity. The theology was perfect  the timing unquestionable  and the answer as honest as a sinner could get.  I mustn't love you   I said to them.  But I will ask God for forgiveness.   Because you don't love us  Norman  clearly you've chosen your path.  Twenty four hours later  my social worker  this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months  he's waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents. I didn't say goodbye to anybody  not my mother  my father  my sisters  my brothers  my aunts  my uncles  my cousins  my grandparents  nobody. On the way to the children's home  I started to ask myself   What's happened to me   It's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away. When I got to the   For the next four  five years  I was held in four different children's homes. On the third children's home  at     I started to rebel  and what I did was  I got three tins of paint  Airfix paint that you use for models  and I was    it was a big children's home  big Victorian children's home    and I was in a little turret at the top of it  and I poured them  red  yellow and green  the colors of Africa  down the tiles. You couldn't see it from the street  because the home was surrounded by beech trees. For doing this  I was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center. It was a virtual prison for young people. By the way  years later  my social worker said that I should never have been put in there. I wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong. But because I had no family to inquire about me  they could do anything to me. I'm    years old  and they had a padded cell. They would march me down corridors in last size order. They    I was put in a dormitory with a confirmed Nazi sympathizer. All of the staff were ex police    interesting    and ex probation officers. The man who ran it was an ex army officer. Every time I had a visit by a person who I did not know who would feed me grapes  once every three months  I was strip searched. That home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder. And this was the preparation that I was being given after    years as a child of the state. I have to tell this story. I have to tell it  because there was no one to put two and two together. I slowly became aware that I knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year. See  that's what family does. It gives you reference points. I'm not defining a good family from a bad family. I'm just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is  a mother  a father  a sister  a brother  an aunt  an uncle  a cousin  a grandparent. It matters to someone  and therefore it matters to you. Understand  I was    years old  tucked away in myself  into myself  and I wasn't touched either  physically touched. I'm reporting back. I'm reporting back simply to say that when I left the children's home I had two things that I wanted to do. One was to find my family  and the other was to write poetry. In creativity I saw light. In the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life  the endless truth  the permanent creation of reality  the place where anger was an expression in the search for love  a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth. I've just got to say it to you all  I found all of my family in my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them  and I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else. But I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply that you can define how strong a democracy is by how its government treats its child. I don't mean children. I mean the child of the state. Thanks very much. It's been an honor.  Applause  I was one of those kids that  every time I got in the car  I basically had to roll down the window. It was usually too hot  too stuffy or just too smelly  and my father would not let us use the air conditioner. He said that it would overheat the engine. And you might remember  some of you  how the cars were back then  and it was a common problem of overheating. But it was also the signal that capped the use  or overuse  of energy consuming devices. Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country. We blast the air conditioning the entire way  and we never experience overheating. So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop. Great  right  Well  we have similar problems in buildings. In the past  before air conditioning  we had thick walls. The thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior very cool during the summertime  and warm during the wintertime  and the small windows were also very good because it limited the amount of temperature transfer between the interior and exterior. Then in about the     s  with the advent of plate glass  rolled steel and mass production  we were able to make floor to ceiling windows and unobstructed views  and with that came the irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar heated spaces. Over time  the buildings got taller and bigger  our engineering even better  so that the mechanical systems were massive. They require a huge amount of energy. They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere  and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities  where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas  but we also have problems that  when we lose power  we can't open a window here  and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again. Even worse  with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net zero energy state  we can't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient. We need to look for something else  and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut. So what do we do here  How do we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we've dug  If we look at biology  and many of you probably don't know  I was a biology major before I went into architecture  the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body  and it's a fantastic thing. That's the first line of defense for the body. It has pores  it has sweat glands  it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently  and so what I propose is that our building skins should be more similar to human skin  and by doing so can be much more dynamic  responsive and differentiated  depending on where it is. And this gets me back to my research. What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that. I presently  or currently  work with smart materials  and a smart thermo bimetal. First of all  I guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy  and that's a very big deal for architecture. What it is  it's a lamination of two different metals together. You can see that here by the different reflection on this side. And because it has two different coefficients of expansion  when heated  one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action. So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system  and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen when also heated  and currently have this installation at the Materials   Applications gallery in Silver Lake  close by  and it's there until August  if you want to see it. It's called  Bloom   and the surface is made completely out of thermo bimetal  and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things. One  it's a sun shading device  so that when the sun hits the surface  it constricts the amount of sun passing through  and in other areas  it's a ventilating system  so that hot  trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary. You can see here in this time lapse video that the sun  as it moves across the surface  as well as the shade  each of the tiles moves individually. Keep in mind  with the digital technology that we have today  this thing was made out of about        pieces and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different. And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate each one to be very  very specific to its location  to the angle of the sun  and also how the thing actually curls. So this kind of proof of concept project has a lot of implications to actual future application in architecture  and in this case  here you see a house  that's for a developer in China  and it's actually a four story glass box. It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access  but now it's sheathed with this thermo bimetal layer  it's a screen that goes around it  and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface. In addition to that  it can also screen areas for privacy  so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas in the space during different times of day. And what it basically implies is that  in houses now  we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things  as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building. I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market  and so here you see a pretty typical double glazed window panel  and in that panel  between those two pieces of glass  that double glazing  I'm trying to work on making a thermo bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and heats that interior cavity  that thermo bimetal will begin to curl  and what actually will happen then is it'll start to block out the sun in certain areas of the building  and totally  if necessary. And so you can imagine  even in this application  that in a high rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to        floors  the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface. And these are some later studies that I'm working on right now that are on the boards  where you can see  in the bottom right hand corner  with the red  it's actually smaller pieces of thermometal  and it's actually going to  we're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes. This last project is also of components. The influence    and if you have noticed  one of my spheres of influence is biology    is from a grasshopper. And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system. They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles  and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down  and so in this project  I'm trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too  how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building. And so you see here some early studies of blocks  where those holes are actually coming through  and this is before the thermo bimetal is applied  and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry  it's a little hard to see  but on the surfaces  you can see these red arrows. On the left  it's when it's cold and the thermo bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks  and on the right  the thermo bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through  so those are two different components that I'm working on  and again  it's a completely different thing  because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows. So I want to leave you with one last impression about the project  or this kind of work and using smart materials. When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds day after day  when you're on vacation and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls  or when there's a power outage  and you have no electricity to rely on  these thermo bimetals will still be working tirelessly  efficiently and endlessly. Thank you.  Applause  Good morning. So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve  to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow. As a cyber magician  I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced. You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass. It's new technology. You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data  names of places  monuments  buildings  maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street. So these are my illusion glasses. They're a little bigger. They're a prototype. And when you look through them  you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber illusionist. Let me show you what I mean. All we need is a playing card. Any card will do. Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again. All right. Very significant mark. And let's put it back into the deck  somewhere in the middle  and let's get started. Voice  System ready. Acquiring image. Marco Tempest  For those of you who don't play cards  a deck of cards is made up of four different suits  hearts  clubs  diamonds and spades. The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols  and have been interpreted in many different ways. Now  some say that the four suits represent the four seasons. There's spring  summer  autumn and     Voice  My favorite season is winter.MT  Well yeah  mine too. Winter is like magic. It's a time of change  when warmth turns to cold  water turns to snow  and then it all disappears. There are    cards in each suit.  Music  Voice  Each card represents a phase of the    lunar cycles. MT  So over here is low tide  and over here is high tide  and in the middle is the moon. Voice  The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic. MT  There are two colors in a deck of cards. There is the color red and the color black  representing the constant change from day to night. Voice  Marco  I did not know you could do that.  Laughter  MT  And is it a coincidence that there are    cards in a deck of cards  just as there are    weeks in a year  Voice  If you total all the spots on a deck of cards  the result is    . MT  Oh       the number of days in a year  the number of days between each birthday. Make a wish.  Blowing noise  Voice  Don't tell  or it won't come true. MT  Well  as a matter of fact  it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards  and ever since that day  I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls  men and women  husbands and wives  even kings and queens.  Applause  Voice  And who are these MT  Ah  mischief makers. Watch. Wake up. Joker  Whoa.MT  Are you ready for your party piece  Joker  Ready MT  Let me see what you've got. Joker  Presenting my pogo stick.MT  Ah. Watch out. Joker  Whoa  whoa  whoa  oh   Music  MT  But today  I am performing for a different kind of audience. I'm performing for you. Voice  Signed card detected.MT  Well  sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician  Is it a   to   job  Of course not  You've got to practice     . I don't literally mean    hours  seven days a week.      is a little bit of an exaggeration  but it does take practice. Now  some people will say  well  magic  that must be the work of some evil supernatural force.  Laughter   Applause  Whoa. Well  to this  I just say  no no. Actually  in German  it's nein nein.  Laughter  Magic isn't that intense. I have to warn you  though  if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this  don't play for money. Voice  Why not  That's a very good hand. The odds of getting it are       to one. MT  Yeah  but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds. Voice  I think you got your birthday wish.MT  And that actually leaves me with the last  and most important card of all  the one with this very significant mark on it. And unlike anything else we've just seen  virtual or not.Voice  Signed card detected. Digital MT  This is without a question the real thing. MT  Bye bye.  Music  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  So little Billy goes to school  and he sits down and the teacher says   What does your father do   And little Billy says   My father plays the piano in an opium den.  So the teacher rings up the parents  and says   Very shocking story from little Billy today. Just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den.  And the father says   I'm very sorry. Yes  it's true  I lied. But how can I tell an eight year old boy that his father is a politician    Laughter  Now  as a politician myself  standing in front of you  or indeed  meeting any stranger anywhere in the world  when I eventually reveal the nature of my profession  they look at me as though I'm somewhere between a snake  a monkey and an iguana  and through all of this  I feel  strongly  that something is going wrong. Four hundred years of maturing democracy  colleagues in Parliament who seem to me  as individuals  reasonably impressive  an increasingly educated  energetic  informed population  and yet a deep  deep sense of disappointment. My colleagues in Parliament include  in my new intake  family doctors  businesspeople  professors  distinguished economists  historians  writers  army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors. All of them  however  including myself  as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road  feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts  feel as though we have become profoundly diminished. And this isn't just a problem in Britain. It's a problem across the developing world  and in middle income countries too. In Jamaica  for example    look at Jamaican members of Parliament  you meet them  and they're often people who are Rhodes Scholars  who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton  and yet  you go down to downtown Kingston  and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites that you can see in any middle income country in the world  a dismal  depressing landscape of burnt and half abandoned buildings. And this has been true for    years  and the handover in             between one Jamaican leader who was the son of a Rhodes Scholar and a Q.C. to another who'd done an economics doctorate at Harvard  over     people were killed in the streets in drug related violence. Ten years ago  however  the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary. George W. Bush stood up in his State of the Union address in      and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the world. He said  because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors  freedom will bring peace. Distinguished academics at the same time argued that democracies had this incredible range of side benefits. They would bring prosperity  security  overcome sectarian violence  ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists. Since then  what's happened  Well  what we've seen is the creation  in places like Iraq and Afghanistan  of democratic systems of government which haven't had any of those side benefits. In Afghanistan  for example  we haven't just had one election or two elections. We've gone through three elections  presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find  Do we find a flourishing civil society  a vigorous rule of law and good security  No. What we find in Afghanistan is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt  a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective  a media which is beginning to get onto its feet but a government that's deeply unpopular  perceived as being deeply corrupt  and security that is shocking  security that's terrible. In Pakistan  in lots of sub Saharan Africa  again you can see democracy and elections are compatible with corrupt governments  with states that are unstable and dangerous. And when I have conversations with people  I remember having a conversation  for example  in Iraq  with a community that asked me whether the riot we were seeing in front of us  this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building  was a sign of the new democracy. The same  I felt  was true in almost every single one of the middle and developing countries that I went to  and to some extent the same is true of us. Well  what is the answer to this  Is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy  Well  obviously not. It would be absurd if we were to engage again in the kind of operations we were engaged in  in Iraq and Afghanistan if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation in which we were imposing anything other than a democratic system. Anything else would run contrary to our values  it would run contrary to the wishes of the people on the ground  it would run contrary to our interests. I remember in Iraq  for example  that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy. We went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned from Bosnia was that elections held too early enshrined sectarian violence  enshrined extremist parties  so in Iraq in      the decision was made  let's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in voter education. Let's invest in democratization. The result was that I found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people  this is actually a photograph taken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq of people standing outside screaming for the elections  and when I went out and said   What is wrong with the interim provincial council  What is wrong with the people that we have chosen  There is a Sunni sheikh  there's a Shiite sheikh  there's the seven    leaders of the seven major tribes  there's a Christian  there's a Sabian  there are female representatives  there's every political party in this council  what's wrong with the people that we chose   The answer came   The problem isn't the people that you chose. The problem is that you chose them.  I have not met  in Afghanistan  in even the most remote community  anybody who does not want a say in who governs them. Most remote community  I have never met a villager who does not want a vote. So we need to acknowledge that despite the dubious statistics  despite the fact that    percent of people in Britain feel politics is broken  despite the fact that when I was in Iraq  we did an opinion poll in      and asked people what political systems they preferred  and the answer came back that seven percent wanted the United States  five percent wanted France  three percent wanted Britain  and nearly    percent wanted Dubai  which is  after all  not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous minor monarchy  democracy is a thing of value for which we should be fighting. But in order to do so we need to get away from instrumental arguments. We need to get away from saying democracy matters because of the other things it brings. We need to get away from feeling  in the same way  human rights matters because of the other things it brings  or women's rights matters for the other things it brings. Why should we get away from those arguments  Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying  for example  torture is wrong because it doesn't extract good information  or we say  you need women's rights because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force  you leave yourself open to the position where the government of North Korea can turn around and say   Well actually  we're having a lot of success extracting good information with our torture at the moment   or the government of Saudi Arabia to say   Well  our economic growth's okay  thank you very much  considerably better than yours  so maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights.  The point about democracy is not instrumental. It's not about the things that it brings. The point about democracy is not that it delivers legitimate  effective  prosperous rule of law. It's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors. The point about democracy is intrinsic. Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity  the dignity of the individual  the idea that each individual should have an equal vote  an equal say  in the formation of their government. But if we're really to make democracy vigorous again  if we're ready to revivify it  we need to get involved in a new project of the citizens and the politicians. Democracy is not simply a question of structures. It is a state of mind. It is an activity. And part of that activity is honesty. After I speak to you today  I'm going on a radio program called  Any Questions   and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never  ever say that they don't know the answer to a question. It doesn't matter what it is. If you ask about child tax credits  the future of the penguins in the south Antarctic  asked to hold forth on whether or not the developments in Chongqing contribute to sustainable development in carbon capture  and we will have an answer for you. We need to stop that  to stop pretending to be omniscient beings. Politicians also need to learn  occasionally  to say that certain things that voters want  certain things that voters have been promised  may be things that we cannot deliver or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver. And the second thing we should do is understand the genius of our societies. Our societies have never been so educated  have never been so energized  have never been so healthy  have never known so much  cared so much  or wanted to do so much  and it is a genius of the local. One of the reasons why we're moving away from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand  banqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling of kings enthroned  the entire drama played out here on this space  where the King of England had his head lopped off  why we've moved from spaces like this  thrones like that  towards the town hall  is we're moving more and more towards the energies of our people  and we need to tap that. That can mean different things in different countries. In Britain  it could mean looking to the French  learning from the French  getting directly elected mayors in place in a French commune system. In Afghanistan  it could have meant instead of concentrating on the big presidential and parliamentary elections  we should have done what was in the Afghan constitution from the very beginning  which is to get direct local elections going at a district level and elect people's provincial governors. But for any of these things to work  the honesty in language  the local democracy  it's not just a question of what politicians do. It's a question of what the citizens do. For politicians to be honest  the public needs to allow them to be honest  and the media  which mediates between the politicians and the public  needs to allow those politicians to be honest. If local democracy is to flourish  it is about the active and informed engagement of every citizen. In other words  if democracy is to be rebuilt  is to become again vigorous and vibrant  it is necessary not just for the public to learn to trust their politicians  but for the politicians to learn to trust the public. Thank you very much indeed.  Applause  I grew up in Bihar  India's poorest state  and I remember when I was six years old  I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep. My brothers and I dug in  and that's when my father came home. He was livid  and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half eaten sweets was pulled away from us. Later  I understood why my father got so upset. Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract. My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar  and he had developed a firm stance against corruption  even though he was harassed and threatened. His was a lonely struggle  because Bihar was also India's most corrupt state  where public officials were enriching themselves   rather  than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling. And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty. And as I went village to village  I remember one day  when I was famished and exhausted  and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree  and just at that time  one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me. Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days. This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life. I resolved to give back. Later  I joined the World Bank  which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries. My initial work focused on Uganda  where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans. But after we disbursed the loans  I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers  new health clinics without drugs  and the poor once again without any voice or recourse. It was Bihar all over again. Bihar represents the challenge of development  abject poverty surrounded by corruption. Globally   .  billion people live on less than   .   a day  and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since       when winners of World War II      founding fathers  and one lonely founding mother  gathered in New Hampshire  USA  to establish the Bretton Woods institutions  including the World Bank. And that traditional approach to development had three key elements. First  transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to poorer countries in the South  accompanied by reform prescriptions. Second  the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque  with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved. And third  the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens  who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance. Today  each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment. Open knowledge  open aid  open governance  and together  they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar. The first key shift is open knowledge. You know  developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S.  Europe or the World Bank. They get their inspiration  their hope  their practical know how  from successful emerging economies in the South. They want to know how China lifted     million people out of poverty in    years  how Mexico's Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children. This is the new ecosystem of open knowledge flows  not just traveling North to South  but South to South  and even South to North  with Mexico's Oportunidades today inspiring New York City. And just as these North to South transfers are opening up  so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers. This is the second shift  open aid. Recently  the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use  releasing       economic and social indicators for     countries over    years  and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data. Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance. Take GeoMapping. In this map from Kenya  the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located  and the darker the shade of green  the more the number of out of school children. So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out of school children  provoking new questions. Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help  In this manner  the World Bank has now GeoMapped        project activities in     countries  and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects. This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid. And this leads me to the third  and in my view  the most significant shift in development  open governance. Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability. From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India  using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability. Are governments delivering services to the citizens  So for instance  several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public. But  you know  there is a big difference between a budget that's public and a budget that's accessible. This is a public budget.  Laughter  And as you can see  it's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources. To tackle this problem  governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it's more understandable to the public. In this map from Moldova  the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes  and the red color shows the opposite. Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual  and what's exciting is that with this openness  there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government. So in the Philippines today  parents and students can give real time feedback on a website  Checkmyschool.org  or using SMS  whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school  the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar. And the government is responsive. So for instance  when it was reported on this website that     students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption  the Department of Education in the Philippines took swift action. And you know what's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South  from the Philippines to Indonesia  Kenya  Moldova and beyond. In Dar es Salaam  Tanzania  even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations. This is what the map of Tandale looked like in August      . But within a few weeks  university students were able to use mobile phones and an open source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure. And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working  aggregated in the red bubbles that you see  which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor. Today  even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent  accessible and responsive to the poor. But  you know  in many parts of the world  governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor  and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system. These are the lonely warriors like my father and many  many others  and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds. So for instance  today  in Ghana  courageous reformers from civil society  Parliament and government  have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector  and  galvanized by this  reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts. These examples give new hope  new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar. Two years ago  on April  th        I called my father. It was very late at night  and at age     he was typing a    page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project. Though he was no lawyer  he argued the case in court himself the next day. He won the ruling  but later that very evening  he fell  and he died. He fought till the end  increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty  not only did government officials need to be honest  but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard. These became the two bookends of his life  and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape. Today  I'm inspired by these changes  and I'm excited that at the World Bank  we are embracing these new directions  a significant departure from my work in Uganda    years ago. We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions  inspiring practitioners  so aid becomes transparent  accountable and effective  so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government. We need to accelerate these shifts. If we do  we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar  in Uganda  and beyond. We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children. We will find that these children  too  have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty. Thank you.  Applause  What I want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that I'm going to describe to you. The first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly. If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems  they simply will not work. That's the first thing. The second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal  if we study this mammal  we're going to get great insight into our diseases of the senses  such as blindness and deafness. And the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies deep within its DNA. So are you all thinking  So  magnificent creature  isn't it  Who here thought of a bat  Ah  I can see half the audience agrees with me  and I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you. So I have had the good fortune for the past    years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals. One fifth of all living mammals is a bat  and they have very unique attributes. Bats as we know them have been around on this planet for about    million years. One of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly. Now flight is an inherently difficult thing. Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times  once in the bats  once in the birds  and once in the pterodactyls. And so with flight  it's very metabolically costly. Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this. But one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment. They use echolocation. Now  what I mean by echolocation    they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose. This sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment  and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image. And this enables them to orient in complete darkness. Indeed  they do look very strange. We're humans. We're a visual species. When scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night  we didn't believe it. For a hundred years  despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing  we didn't believe it. Now  if you look at this bat  it looks a little bit alien. Indeed  the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel once said   To truly experience an alien life form on this planet  you should lock yourself inside a room with a flying  echolocating bat in complete darkness.  And if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat  you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it. Very big ears  strange nose leaves  but teeny tiny eyes. So again  if you just look at this bat  you realize sound is very important for its survival. Most bats look like the previous one. However  there are a group that do not use echolocation. They do not perceive their environment using sound  and these are the flying foxes. If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia  you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney  and if you just look at their face  you can see they have much  much larger eyes and much smaller ears. So among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception. Now this is going to be important for what I'm going to tell you later during the talk. Now  if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you  and I know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats  that's probably not that surprising  because here in Western culture  bats have been demonized. Really  of course the famous book  Dracula   written by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker  probably is mainly responsible for this. However  I also think it's got to do with the fact that bats come out at night  and we don't really understand them. We're a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us. Bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events. They are the perpetrators in horror movies  such as this famous  Nightwing.  Also  if you think about it  demons always have bat wings  whereas birds  they typically    or angels have bird wings. Now  this is Western society  and what I hope to do tonight is to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture  that they perceive bats as creatures that bring good luck  and indeed  if you walk into a Chinese home  you may see an image such as this. This is considered the Five Blessings. The Chinese word for  bat  sounds like the Chinese word for  happiness   and they believe that bats bring wealth  health  longevity  virtue and serenity. And indeed  in this image  you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five bats. And what I want to do tonight is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat  and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings. So  wealth    how can a bat possibly bring us wealth  Now as I said before  bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly. And why is this  Bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants. They also feed on fruit  and they disperse the seeds of these fruits. Bats are responsible for pollinating the tequila plant  and this is a multi million dollar industry in Mexico. So indeed  we need them for our ecosystems to function properly. Without them  it's going to be a problem. But most bats are voracious insect predators. It's been estimated in the U.S.  in a tiny colony of big brown bats  that they will feed on over a million insects a year  and in the United States of America  right now bats are being threatened by a disease known as white nose syndrome. It's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out populations of bats  and scientists have estimated that       metric tons of insects a year are now remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats. Bats are also threatened in the U.S. by their attraction to wind farms. Again  right now bats are looking at a little bit of a problem. They're going to    They are very threatened in the United States of America alone. Now how can this help us  Well  it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation  we're going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops. And for one year in the U.S. alone  it's estimated that it's going to cost    billion U.S. dollars  if we remove bats. So indeed  bats then do bring us wealth. They maintain the health of our ecosystems  and also they save us money. So again  that's the first blessing. Bats are important for our ecosystems. And what about the second  What about health  Inside every cell in your body lies your genome. Your genome is made up of your DNA  your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are. Now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies  it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome in a very rapid time and at a very  very reduced cost. Now when we've been doing this  we've realized that there's variations within our genome. So I want you to look at the person beside you. Just have a quick look. And what we need to realize is that every     base pairs in your DNA  you're a little bit different. And one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases  or does this variation just make you different  Again  what does it mean here  What does this variation actually mean  So if we are to capitalize on all of this new molecular data and personalized genomic information that is coming online that we will be able to have in the next few years  we have to be able to differentiate between the two. So how do we do this  Well  I believe we just look at nature's experiments. So through natural selection  over time  mutations  variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time. Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation. And so therefore  if you look at the same region of a genome in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent  you will get a better understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is  i.e.  if it is important for the mammal to function  for its survival  it will be the same in all of those different lineages  species  taxa. So therefore  if we were to do this  what we'd need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same or if it's different. So if it is the same  this indicates that that site is important for a function  so a disease mutation should fall within that site. So in this case here  if all the mammals that we look at have a yellow type genome at that site  it probably suggests that purple is bad. This could be even more powerful if you look at mammals that are doing things slightly differently. So say  for example  the region of the genome that I was looking at was a region that's important for vision. If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well  such as bats  and we find that bats that don't see so well have the purple type  we know that this is probably what's causing this disease. So in my lab  we've been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of the senses. We're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this  Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired  and    million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem  and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases  so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene cause the disease. Also we look at deafness. One in every       newborn babies are deaf  and when we reach     over half of us will also have a hearing problem. Again  there's many underlying genetic causes for this. So what we've been doing in my lab is looking at these unique sensory specialists  the bats  and we have looked at genes that cause blindness when there's a defect in them  genes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them  and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease. So bats are also important for our health  to enable us to better understand how our genome functions. So this is where we are right now  but what about the future  What about longevity  This is where we're going to go  and as I said before  I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies within the bat genome. So why should we be interested in aging at all  Well  really  this is a picture drawn from the     s of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered one of the most familiar  yet the least well understood  aspects of all of biology  and really  since the dawn of civilization  mankind has sought to avoid it. But we are going to have to understand it a bit better. In Europe alone  by       there is going to be a    percent increase of individuals over     and     percent increase in individuals over   . As we age  we deteriorate  and this deterioration causes problems for our society  so we have to address it. So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome  Does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for  Who    put up your hands    who says two years  Nobody  One  How about    years  Some  How about     How about     Okay  it's a whole varied response. This bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest living bat. It lived for up to    years  and this bat's still alive in the wild today. But what would be so amazing about this  Well  typically  in mammals there is a relationship between body size  metabolic rate  and how long you can live for  and you can predict how long a mammal can live for given its body size. So typically  small mammals live fast  die young. Think of a mouse. But bats are very different. As you can see here on this graph  in blue  these are all other mammals  but bats can live up to nine times longer than expected despite having a really  really high metabolic rate  and the question is  how can they do that  There are    species of mammal that live longer than expected  given their body size  than man  and    of those are bats. So therefore  they must have something within their DNA that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses  particularly of flight. They expend three times more energy than a mammal of the same size  but don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects. So right now  in my lab  we're combining state of the art bat field biology  going out and catching the long lived bats  with the most up to date  modern molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do. And hopefully in the next five years  I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that. Aging is a big problem for humanity  and I believe that by studying bats  we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals to achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out what they're doing  perhaps through gene therapy  we can enable us to do the same thing. Potentially  this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it. Just imagine what that would be like. So really  I don't think we should be thinking of them as flying demons of the night  but more as our superheroes. And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem  they allow us to understand how our genome functions  and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth. So tonight  when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies  and you see this beautiful flying mammal  I want you to smile. Thank you.  Applause  I think the beautiful Malin  Akerman  put it perfectly. Every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury. Ladies and gentlemen  and more importantly  Mo Bros and Mo Sistas    Laughter    for the next    minutes  I'm going to share with you my Movember journey  and how  through that journey  we've redefined charity  we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world  and I hope  through that process  that I inspire you to create something significant in your life  something significant that will go on and make this world a better place. So the most common question I get asked  and I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight  is how did this come about  How did Movember start  Well  normally  a charity starts with the cause  and someone that is directly affected by a cause. They then go on to create an event  and beyond that  a foundation to support that. Pretty much in every case  that's how a charity starts. Not so with Movember. Movember started in a very traditional Australian way. It was on a Sunday afternoon. I was with my brother and a mate having a few beers  and I was watching the world go by  had a few more beers  and the conversation turned to '  s fashion    Laughter    and how everything manages to come back into style. And a few more beers  I said   There has to be some stuff that hasn't come back.   Laughter  Then one more beer and it was  whatever happened to the mustache  Why hasn't that made a comeback   Laughter  So then there was a lot more beers  and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back.  Laughter  So in Australia   mo  is slang for mustache  so we renamed the month of November  Movember  and created some pretty basic rules  which still stand today. And they are  start the month clean shaven  rock a mustache    not a beard  not a goatee  a mustache    for the    days of November  and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month  have a mustache themed party  and award a prize for the best  and of course  the worst mustache.  Laughter  Now trust me  when you're growing a mustache back in       and there were    of us back then  and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement    Laughter    it created a lot of controversy.  Laughter  So my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients. My girlfriend at the time  who's no longer my girlfriend    Laughter    hated it. Parents would shuffle kids away from us.  Laughter  But we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey  and it was a real journey. And we had a lot of fun  and in       I said to the guys   That was so much fun. We need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year.   Laughter  So we started thinking about that  and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer. And we thought  you know what  there's nothing for men's health. Why is that  Why can't we combine growing a mustache and doing something for men's health  And I started to research that topic  and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it. But there was nothing for this cause  so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer  and then we created our tagline  which is   Changing the face of men's health.  And that eloquently describes the challenge  changing your appearance for the    days  and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve  getting men engaged in their health  having them have a better understanding about the health risks that they face. So with that model  I then cold called the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation. I said to him   I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization.   Laughter  And I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone  so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in     . And we sat down  and I shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia  raising awareness for this cause  and funds for his organization. And I needed a partnership to legitimately do that. And I said   We're going to come together at the end  we're going to have a mustache themed party  we're going to have DJs  we're going to celebrate life  and we're going to change the face of men's health.  And he just looked at me and laughed  and he said  he said   Adam  that's a really novel idea  but we're an ultraconservative organization. We can't have anything to do with you.   Laughter  So I paid for coffee that day    Laughter    and his parting comment as we shook hands was   Listen  if you happen to raise any money out of this  we'll gladly take it.   Laughter  So my lesson that year was persistence. And we persisted  and we got     guys growing mustaches  and together we raised        dollars  and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia  and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received. So from that day forward  my life has become about a mustache. Every day    this morning  I wake up and go  my life is about a mustache.  Laughter  Essentially  I'm a mustache farmer.  Laughter  And my season is November.  Applause  So in       the campaign got more momentum  was more successful in Australia and then New Zealand  and then in      we came to a pivotal point. It was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought  we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund Movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level. It's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches.  Laughter  Let me tell you that there's not too many people interested in investing in that  not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation  who we'd raised about  .  million dollars for at that stage. So again we persisted  and Foster's Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever sponsorship  and that was enough for me to quit my job  I did consulting on the side. And leading into Movember       we'd run through all the money from Foster's  we'd run through all the money I had  and essentially we had no money left  and we'd convinced all our suppliers    creative agencies  web development agencies  hosting companies  whatnot    to delay their billing until December. So we'd racked up at this stage about         dollars worth of debt. So if Movember      didn't happen  the four founders  well  we would've been broke  we would've been homeless  sitting on the street with mustaches.  Laughter  But we thought  you know what  if that's the worst thing that happens  so what  We're going to have a lot of fun doing it  and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks. Then in early       a really interesting thing happened. We had Mo Bros from Canada  from the U.S.  and from the U.K. emailing us and calling us and saying  hey  there's nothing for prostate cancer. Bring this campaign to these countries. So we thought  why not  Let's do it. So I cold called the CEO of Prostate Cancer Canada  and I said to him   I have this most amazing concept.   It's going to transform your organization. I don't want to tell you about it now  but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto   So I flew here  met down on Front Street East  and we sat in the boardroom  and I said   Right  here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization.  And he looked at me and laughed and said   Adam  sounds like a really novel idea  but we're an ultraconservative organization.   Laughter  I've heard this before. I know how it goes. But he said   We will partner with you  but we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work.  So what we did was  we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country  the U.S  and the U.K.  and we did that because we knew  if this was successful  we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia. And that money fuels research  and that research will get us to a cure. And we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure  we're about finding the cure. So in       we brought the campaign across here  and it was  it set the stage for the campaign. It wasn't as successful as we thought it would be. We were sort of very gung ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage. So that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets. But what I'm really pleased to say is  in       Movember became a truly global movement. Canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world. Last year we had         Mo Bros spread across the world and together we raised    million dollars. And that makes Movember now the biggest funder of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world. And that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches.  Laughter  And for us  we have redefined charity. Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon.  Laughter  Our ambassadors are the Mo Bros and the Mo Sistas  and I think that's been fundamental to our success. We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people. We let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way. So now I live in Los Angeles  because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there  and I always get asked by the media down there  because it's so celebrity driven   Who are your celebrity ambassadors   And I say to them   Last year we were fortunate enough to have         celebrity ambassadors.  And they go   What  what do you mean   And it's like  everything single person  every single Mo Bro and Mo Sista that participates in Movember is our celebrity ambassador  and that is so  so important and fundamental to our success. Now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching Movember moments  and it happened here in Toronto last year  at the end of the campaign. I was out with a team. It was the end of Movember. We'd had a great campaign  and to be honest  we'd had our fair share of beer that night  but I said   You know what  I think we've got one more bar left in us.   Laughter  So we piled into a taxi  and this is our taxi driver  and I was sitting in the back seat  and he turned around and said   Where are you going   And I said   Hang on  that is an amazing mustache.  And he said   I'm doing it for Movember.  And I said   So am I.  And I said   Tell me your Movember story.  And he goes   Listen  I know it's about men's health  I know it's about prostate cancer  but this is for breast cancer.  And I said   Okay  that's interesting.  And he goes   Last year  my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka  because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her   and he said   This mustache is my tribute to my mom.  And we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi  and I didn't tell him who I was  because I didn't think it was appropriate  and I just shook his hand and I said   Thank you so much. Your mom would be so proud.  And from that moment I realized that Movember is so much more than a mustache  having a joke. It's about each person coming to this platform  embracing it in their own way  and being significant in their own life. For us now at Movember  we really focus on three program areas  and having a true impact  awareness and education  survivor support programs  and research. Now we always focus  naturally  on how much we raise  because it's a very tangible outcome  but for me  awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise  because I know that is changing and saving lives today  and it's probably best exampled by a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin  Texas  at the start of the year. He came up to me and said   Thank you for starting Movember.  And I said   Thank you for doing Movember.  And I looked at him  and I was like   I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache.   Laughter  And I said   What's your Movember story   And he said   I grew the worst mustache ever.   Laughter   But I went home for Thanksgiving dinner  and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on.   Laughter   And we talked    I talked to them about Movember  and then after that  my dad came up to me  and at the age of     for the first time ever  I had a conversation with my dad one on one about men's health. I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer  and I learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease  and he didn't know that  and he hadn't been getting screened for it.  So now  that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer. So those conversations  getting men engaged in this  at whatever age  is so critically important  and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise. Now to the funds we raise  and research  and how we're redefining research. We fund prostate cancer foundations now in    countries. We literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world  and when we looked at this more recently  we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions  let alone nationally  let alone globally  and this is not unique to prostate cancer. This is cancer research the world over. And so we said  right  we'd redefined charity. We need to redefine the way these guys operate. How do we do that  So what we did was  we created a global action plan  and we're taking    percent of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund  and we've got the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world that look after that fund  and they come together each year and identify the number one priority  and that  last year  was getting a better screening test. So they identified that as a priority  and then they've got and recruited now     researchers from around the world that are studying that topic  essentially the same topic. So now we're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together  and that's a unique thing in the cancer world  and we know  through that collaboration  it will accelerate outcomes. And that's how we're redefining the research world. So  what I know about my Movember journey is that  with a really creative idea  with passion  with persistence  and a lot of patience  four mates  four mustaches  can inspire a room full of people  and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city  and that city is Melbourne  my home. And that city can go on and inspire a state  and that state can go on and inspire a nation  and beyond that  you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health. My name is Adam Garone  and that's my story. Thank you.  Applause  Today I have just one request. Please don't tell me I'm normal. Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers. Remi is     tall and very handsome. He's speechless  but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot. Remi knows what love is. He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless. He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color. He doesn't care about religious differences  and get this  He has never told a lie. When he sings songs from our childhood  attempting words that not even I could remember  he reminds me of one thing  how little we know about the mind  and how wonderful the unknown must be. Samuel is   . He's tall. He's very handsome. He has the most impeccable memory. He has a selective one  though. He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar  but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod  conversations we had when he was four  weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies  and Lady Gaga's birthday. Don't they sound incredible  But most people don't agree. And in fact  because their minds don't fit into society's version of normal  they're often bypassed and misunderstood. But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case  although they were not seen as ordinary  this could only mean one thing  that they were extraordinary    autistic and extraordinary. Now  for you who may be less familiar with the term  autism   it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication  learning and sometimes physical skills. It manifests in each individual differently  hence why Remi is so different from Sam. And across the world  every    minutes  one new person is diagnosed with autism  and although it's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world  there is no known cause or cure. And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism  but I cannot recall a day without it. I was just three years old when my brother came along  and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life. And after a few months went by  I realized that he was different. He screamed a lot. He didn't want to play like the other babies did  and in fact  he didn't seem very interested in me whatsoever. Remi lived and reigned in his own world  with his own rules  and he found pleasure in the smallest things  like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between. And as he grew older  he grew more different  and the differences became more obvious. Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never ending hyperactivity was something really unique  a pure and innocent nature  a boy who saw the world without prejudice  a human who had never lied. Extraordinary. Now  I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family  moments where I've wished that they were just like me. But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me about individuality and communication and love  and I realize that these are things that I wouldn't want to change with normality. Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us  and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong. It just means that there's a different kind of right. And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you  it would be that you don't have to be normal. You can be extraordinary. Because autistic or not  the differences that we have    We've got a gift  Everyone's got a gift inside of us  and in all honesty  the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential. The chance for greatness  for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else. Please    don't tell me I'm normal. Thank you.  Applause  So  people want a lot of things out of life  but I think  more than anything else  they want happiness. Aristotle called happiness  the chief good   the end towards which all other things aim. According to this view  the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable. It's that we expect them to bring us happiness. Now in the last    years  we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want. We're richer. We live longer. We have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago. The paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically  we haven't actually gotten any happier. Maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness  there's been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself. People have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time  in fact for thousands of years  but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved. Well  as with many other domains in life  I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question. In fact  in the last few years  there's been an explosion in research on happiness. For example  we've learned a lot about its demographics  how things like income and education  gender and marriage relate to it. But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect. Yes  it's better to make more money rather than less  or to graduate from college instead of dropping out  but the differences in happiness tend to be small. Which leaves the question  what are the big causes of happiness  I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet  but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment to moment experiences. It certainly seems that we're going about our lives  that what we're doing  who we're with  what we're thinking about  have a big influence on our happiness  and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult  in fact almost impossible  for scientists to study. A few years ago  I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world  something we'd never been able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org  it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time. How does this work  Basically  I send people signals at random points throughout the day  and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment to moment experience at the instant just before the signal. The idea is that  if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day  minute to minute in some cases  and try to understand how what people are doing  who they're with  what they're thinking about  and all the other factors that describe our day  how those might relate to those changes in happiness  we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness. We've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data  a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before  over         real time reports from over        people. And it's not just a lot of people  it's a really diverse group  people from a wide range of ages  from    to late   s  a wide range of incomes  education levels  people who are married  divorced  widowed  etc. They collectively represent every one of    occupational categories and hail from over    countries. What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating  and that's mind wandering. As human beings  we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present. This guy is sitting here working on his computer  and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month  wondering what he's going to have for dinner. Maybe he's worried that he's going bald.  Laughter  This ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can. And yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness. You've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present.  Be here now   you've probably heard a hundred times. Maybe  to really be happy  we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment. Maybe these people are right. Maybe mind wandering is a bad thing. On the other hand  when our minds wander  they're unconstrained. We can't change the physical reality in front of us  but we can go anywhere in our minds. Since we know people want to be happy  maybe when our minds wander  they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense. In other words  maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering. Well  since I'm a scientist  I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data  and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember  this is from sort of moment to moment experience in people's real lives. There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question  How do you feel  on a scale ranging from very bad to very good  Second  an activity question  What are you doing  on a list of    different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV  And finally a mind wandering question  Are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing  People could say no    in other words  I'm focused only on my task    or yes    I am thinking about something else    and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant  neutral or unpleasant. Any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering. So what did we find  This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis  and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present  when they're not mind wandering. As it turns out  people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not. Now you might look at this result and say  okay  sure  on average people are less happy when they're mind wandering  but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with  at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us. Nope. As it turns out  people are less happy when they're mind wandering no matter what they're doing. For example  people don't really like commuting to work very much. It's one of their least enjoyable activities  and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else. It's amazing. So how could this be happening  I think part of the reason  a big part of the reason  is that when our minds wander  we often think about unpleasant things  and they are enormously less happy when they do that  our worries  our anxieties  our regrets  and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral  they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind wandering at all. Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant  they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind wandering. If mind wandering were a slot machine  it would be like having the chance to lose    dollars     dollars or one dollar. Right  You'd never want to play.  Laughter  So I've been talking about this  suggesting  perhaps  that mind wandering causes unhappiness  but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated. It's possible that's the case  but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy  then they mind wander. Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever disentangle these two possibilites  Well  one fact that we can take advantage of  I think a fact you'll all agree is true  is that time goes forward  not backward. Right  The cause has to come before the effect. We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person  and so we can look and see  does mind wandering tend to precede unhappiness  or does unhappiness tend to precede mind wandering  to get some insight into the causal direction. As it turns out  there is a strong relationship between mind wandering now and being unhappy a short time later  consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy. In contrast  there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later. In other words  mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause  and not merely a consequence  of unhappiness. A few minutes ago  I likened mind wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play. Well  how often do people's minds wander  Turns out  they wander a lot. In fact  really a lot. Forty seven percent of the time  people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing. How does that depend on what people are doing  This shows the rate of mind wandering across    activities ranging from a high of    percent    Laughter    when people are taking a shower  brushing their teeth  to    percent when they're working  to    percent when they're exercising  all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at. Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex.  Laughter  But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph  and that is  basically with one exception  no matter what people are doing  they're mind wandering at least    percent of the time  which suggests  I think  that mind wandering isn't just frequent  it's ubiquitous. It pervades basically everything that we do. In my talk today  I've told you a little bit about mind wandering  a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness. My hope is that over time  by tracking people's moment to moment happiness and their experiences in daily life  we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness  and then in the end  a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier  but happier as well. Thank you.  Applause  Two years ago  after having served four years in the United States Marine Corps and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan  I found myself in Port au Prince  leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest hit areas of that city  three days after the earthquake. We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go  the places nobody else could go  and after three weeks  we realized something. Military veterans are very  very good at disaster response. And coming home  my cofounder and I  we looked at it  and we said  there are two problems. The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response. It's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology  and it's not using the best people. The second problem that we became aware of was a very inadequate veteran reintegration  and this is a topic that is front page news right now as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan  and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life. And we sat here and we looked at these two problems  and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems. These are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that  Well  we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home. Recent surveys show that    percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform. And we can use veterans to improve disaster response. Now on the surface  this makes a lot of sense  and in       we responded to the tsunami in Chile  the floods in Pakistan  we sent training teams to the Thai Burma border. But it was earlier this year  when one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the organization. This is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me. We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay was with us in Port au Prince. He was also with us in Chile. Earlier this year  in March  Clay took his own life. This was a tragedy  but it really forced us to refocus what it is that we were doing. You know  Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself because of what he lost when he came home. He lost purpose. He lost his community. And perhaps most tragically  he lost his self worth. And so  as we evaluated  and as the dust settled from this tragedy  we realized that  of those two problems    in the initial iteration of our organization  we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service. We had a lot of success  and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm. But after Clay  we shifted that focus  and suddenly  now moving forward  we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response. Because we think that we can give that purpose and that community and that self worth back to the veteran. And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin  and then later Hurricane Irene  gave us an opportunity to look at that. Now I want you to imagine for a second an    year old boy who graduates from high school in Kansas City  Missouri. He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle. They send him to Iraq. Every day he leaves the wire with a mission. That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home. It's to keep the men around him alive. It's to pacify the village that he works in. He's got a purpose. But he comes home  to  Kansas City  Missouri  maybe he goes to college  maybe he's got a job  but he doesn't have that same sense of purpose. You give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin  Missouri after a tornado  he regains that. Going back  that same    year old boy graduates from high school in Kansas City  Missouri  joins the Army  the Army gives him a rifle  they send him to Iraq. Every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him. He leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back. He's slept in the same sand. They've lived together. They've eaten together. They've bled together. He goes home to Kansas City  Missouri. He gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off. He doesn't have that community anymore. But you drop    of those veterans in Joplin  Missouri  they get that sense of community back. Again  you have an    year old boy who graduates high school in Kansas City. He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle. They send him to Iraq. They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade. He takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones in his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City. He doesn't have that same self worth. But you send him to Joplin after a tornado  and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service  now they have self worth again. I think it's very important  because right now somebody needs to step up  and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance. Thank you very much.  Applause  So I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world from a totally unique point of view  and this world I'm going to talk about is the micro world. I've found  after doing this for many  many years  that there's a magical world behind reality. And that can be seen directly through a microscope  and I'm going to show you some of this today. So let's start off looking at something rather not so small  something that we can see with our naked eye  and that's a bee. So when you look at this bee  it's about this size here  it's about a centimeter. But to really see the details of the bee  and really appreciate what it is  you have to look a little bit closer. So that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope  and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia  and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they're right up close to something  because they can't see in stereo. As we go smaller  here is a human hair. A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see. It's about a tenth of a millimeter. And as we go smaller again  about ten times smaller than that  is a cell. So you could fit    human cells across the diameter of a human hair. So when we would look at cells  this is how I really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope. When I first saw living cells in a microscope  I was absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like. So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system  they're actually moving all over the place. This cell is looking for foreign objects  bacteria  things that it can find. And it's looking around  and when it finds something  and recognizes it being foreign  it will actually engulf it and eat it. So if you look right there  it finds that little bacterium  and it engulfs it and eats it. If you take some heart cells from an animal  and put it in a dish  they'll just sit there and beat. That's their job. Every cell has a mission in life  and these cells  the mission is to move blood around our body. These next cells are nerve cells  and right now  as we see and understand what we're looking at  our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this right now. They're not just static. They're moving around making new connections  and that's what happens when we learn. As you go farther down this scale here  that's a micron  or a micrometer  and we go all the way down to here to a nanometer and an angstrom. Now  an angstrom is the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom. That's how small that is. And microscopes that we have today can actually see individual atoms. So these are some pictures of individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom. This is a ring of cobalt atoms. So this whole world  the nano world  this area in here is called the nano world  and the nano world  the whole micro world that we see  there's a nano world that is wrapped up within that  and the whole    and that is the world of molecules and atoms. But I want to talk about this larger world  the world of the micro world. So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower  what would that flower look like  if the flower was this big  It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here  and you're a little bug  if you're on that surface of that flower  that's what the terrain would look like. The petal of that flower looks like that  so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects  and if you look a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here  this is the style of that flower  and you notice that it's got these little    these are like little jelly like things that are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs. So this little ant that's crawling here  it's like it's in a little Willy Wonka land. It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see. These are little bits of individual grain of pollen there and there  and here is a    what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen  when you look in a microscope  it's actually made of thousands of little grains of pollen. So this  for example  when you see bees flying around these little plants  and they're collecting pollen  those pollen grains that they're collecting  they pack into their legs and they take it back to the hive  and that's what makes the beehive  the wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar  and that's what makes the honey that we eat. Here's a close up picture  or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth  and if you had really  really good vision  with your naked eye  you'd see it about that well. There's the stamen and the pistil. But look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope. That's the stamen. So that's thousands of little grains of pollen there  and there's the pistil there  and these are the little things called trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give a fragrance  and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances. I want to talk about something really ordinary  just ordinary sand. I became interested in sand about    years ago  when I first saw sand from Maui  and in fact  this is a little bit of sand from Maui. So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size. Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size. But when you look closer at this  look at what's there. It's really quite amazing. You have microshells there. You have things like coral. You have fragments of other shells. You have olivine. You have bits of a volcano. There's a little bit of a volcano there. You have tube worms. An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand. And the reason that is  is because in a place like this island  a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow  and when they die  their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand  things like coral and so forth. So here's  for example  a picture of sand from Maui. This is from Lahaina  and when we're walking along a beach  we're actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history. We don't realize it  but it's actually a record of that entire ecology. So here we see  for example  a sponge spicule  two bits of coral here  that's a sea urchin spine. Really some amazing stuff. So when I first looked at this  I was    I thought  gee  this is like a little treasure trove here. I couldn't believe it  and I'd go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them. Here's what most of the sand in our world looks like. These are quartz crystals and feldspar  so most sand in the world on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar. It's the erosion of granite rock. So mountains are built up  and they erode away by water and rain and ice and so forth  and they become grains of sand. There's some sand that's really much more colorful. These are sand from near the Great Lakes  and you can see that it's filled with minerals like pink garnet and green epidote  all kinds of amazing stuff  and if you look at different sands from different places  every single beach  every single place you look at sand  it's different. Here's from Big Sur  like they're little jewels. There are places in Africa where they do the mining of jewels  and you go to the sand where the rivers have the sand go down to the ocean  and it's like literally looking at tiny jewels through the microscope. So every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different. Every single grain is different. There are no two grains of sand alike in the world. Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere. They're like a snapshot in time. Now sand is not only on Earth  but sand is ubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact  outer space is filled with sand  and that sand comes together to make our planets and the Moon. And you can see those in micrometeorites. This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me  and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole. And they're quite amazing looking  and these are the tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in    the planets and the Moon. So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand  so they sent me sand from all the different landings of the Apollo missions that happened    years ago. And I started taking pictures with my three dimensional microscopes. This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing. I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon  which is sort of interesting. Now  the way my microscopes work is  normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time  so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope  keep taking pictures  and then I have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like  and I do that in  D. So there  you can see  is a left eye view. There's a right eye view. So sort of left eye view  right eye view. Now something's interesting here. This looks very different than any sand on Earth that I've ever seen  and I've seen a lot of sand on Earth  believe me.  Laughter  Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon. Now  the Moon has no atmosphere  so micrometeorites come in continuously  and the whole surface of the Moon is covered with powder now  because for four billion years it's been bombarded by micrometeorites  and when micrometeorites come in at about    to        miles an hour  they vaporize on contact. And you can see here that that is    that's sort of vaporized  and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together. This is a very small grain of sand  this whole thing. And that's called a ring agglutinate. And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that  and you'd never find that on Earth. Most of the sand on the Moon  especially    and you know when you look at the Moon  there's the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areas are lava flows. They're basaltic lava flows  and that's what this sand looks like  very similar to the sand that you would see in Haleakala. Other sands  when these micrometeorites come in  they vaporize and they make these fountains  these microscopic fountains that go up into the    I was going to say  up into the air   but there is no air    goes sort of up  and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly  and they harden  and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the Moon  they have these beautiful colored glass spherules. And these are actually microscopic  you need a microscope to see these. Now here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon  and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there. This grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion years old  and it's never eroded away like the way we have sand on Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling  air  and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the Sun  has these solar storms  and that's erosion by solar radiation. So what I've been trying to tell you today is things even as ordinary as a grain of sand can be truly extraordinary if you look closely and if you look from a different and a new point of view. I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said   To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower  hold infinity in the palm of your hand  and eternity in an hour.  Thank you.  Applause  Across Europe and Central Asia  approximately one million children live in large residential institutions  usually known as orphanages. Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children. Others know more about the living conditions there  but still think they're a necessary evil. After all  where else would we put all of those children who don't have any parents  But    years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development  and this is particularly true for young babies. As we know  babies are born without their full muscle development  and that includes the brain. During the first three years of life  the brain grows to its full size  with most of that growth taking place in the first six months. The brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation. Every time a young baby learns something new    to focus its eyes  to mimic a movement or a facial expression  to pick something up  to form a word or to sit up    new synaptic connections are being built in the brain. New parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning. They are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness. They communicate their delight to their children  who respond with smiles  and a desire to achieve more and to learn more. This forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical  social  language  cognitive and psychomotor development. It is the model for all future relationships with friends  with partners and with their own children. It happens so naturally in most families that we don't even notice it. Most of us are unaware of its importance to human development and  by extension  to the development of a healthy society. And it's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children. In August        I had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting. Those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of Romania after the      revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions. I was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families. Housing     babies  this was Ceausescu's show orphanage  and so I'd been told the conditions were much better. Having worked with lots of young children  I expected the institution to be a riot of noise  but it was as silent as a convent. It was hard to believe there were any children there at all  yet the director showed me into room after room  each containing row upon row of cots  in each of which lay a child staring into space. In a room of    newborns  not one of them was crying. Yet I could see soiled nappies  and I could see that some of the children were distressed  but the only noise was a low  continuous moan. The head nurse told me proudly   You see  our children are very well behaved.  Over the next few days  I began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional. The newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours  but their demands were not met  and so eventually they learned not to bother. Within a few days  they were listless  lethargic  and staring into space like all the others. Over the years  many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children  but often  one member of staff is caring for         and even    children. Hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program. The children must be woken at   and fed at     . At    their nappies must be changed  so a staff member may have only    minutes to feed    or    children. If a child soils its nappy at       he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again. The child's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing  and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling  the walls or the bars of their cots. Since my first visit to Ceausescu's institution  I've seen hundreds of such places across    countries  from the Czech Republic to Sudan. Across all of these diverse lands and cultures  the institutions  and the child's journey through them  is depressingly similar. Lack of stimulation often leads to self stimulating behaviors like hand flapping  rocking back and forth  or aggression  and in some institutions  psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children  whilst in others  children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others. These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities. Most of these children will never leave the institution again. For those without disabilities  at age three  they're transferred to another institution  and at age seven  to yet another. Segregated according to age and gender  they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings  often without even a chance to say goodbye. There's rarely enough to eat. They are often hungry. The older children bully the little ones. They learn to survive. They learn to defend themselves  or they go under. When they leave the institution  they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society. In Moldova  young women raised in institutions are    times more likely to be trafficked than their peers  and a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions  young adults     percent of them had a criminal record     percent were involved in prostitution  and    percent had taken their own lives. But why are there so many orphans in Europe when there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years  In fact  more than    percent of these children have living parents  and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children  but research shows that most parents want their children  and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty  disability and ethnicity. Many countries have not developed inclusive schools  and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school  at age six or seven. The institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home. If the family's poor  they find it difficult to visit  and gradually the relationship breaks down. Behind each of the million children in institutions  there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they've run out of options  like Natalia in Moldova  who only had enough money to feed her baby  and so had to send her older son to the institution  or Desi  in Bulgaria  who looked after her four children at home until her husband died  but then she had to go out to work full time  and with no support  felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution  or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they're pregnant  who leave their babies in a hospital  or the new parents  the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability  and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child's potential  are told by the doctors   Forget her  leave her in the institution  go home and make a healthy one.  This state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable. Every child has the right to a family  deserves and needs a family  and children are amazingly resilient. We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on  they recover their developmental delays  and go on to lead normal  happy lives. It's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions. One study suggests that a family support service costs    percent of an institutional placement  whilst good quality foster care costs usually about    percent. If we spend less on these children but on the right services  we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs. Across Europe  a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania nearly    years ago  there were         children living in institutions  and more entering every day. Now  there are less than         and family support services are provided across the country. In Moldova  despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis  the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than    percent in the last five years  and the resources are being redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools. Many countries have developed national action plans for change. The European Commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support  empowering communities to look after their own children. But there is still much to be done to end the systematic institutionalization of children. Awareness raising is required at every level of society. People need to know the harm that institutions cause to children  and the better alternatives that exist. If we know people who are planning to support orphanages  we should convince them to support family services instead. Together  this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime. Thank you.  Applause  Let me tell you  it has been a fantastic month for deception. And I'm not even talking about the American presidential race.  Laughter  We have a high profile journalist caught for plagiarism  a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves  a New York Times expos  on fake book reviews. It's been fantastic. Now  of course  not all deception hits the news. Much of the deception is everyday. In fact  a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day  as Dave suggested. So it's about      now  suggests that most of us should have lied. Let's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you  in the last    hours    think back    have told a little fib  or a big one  How many have told a little lie out there  All right  good. These are all the liars. Make sure you pay attention to them.  Laughter  No  that looked good  it was about two thirds of you. The other third didn't lie  or perhaps forgot  or you're lying to me about your lying  which is very  very devious.  Laughter  This fits with a lot of the research  which suggests that lying is very pervasive. It's this pervasiveness  combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human  the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up  that has fascinated people throughout history. Here we have Diogenes with his lantern. Does anybody know what he was looking for  A single honest man  and he died without finding one back in Greece. And we have Confucius in the East who was really concerned with sincerity  not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk  but that you believed in what you were doing. You believed in your principles. Now my first professional encounter with deception is a little bit later than these guys  a couple thousand years. I was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid '  s. Yeah. I was defending Canada's borders. You may think that's a weapon right there. In fact  that's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders.  Laughter  Very Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception while doing my duty here in customs  one of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong  and I'll tell you about some of that tonight. But even since just       '    the way we communicate has been completely transformed. We email  we text  we skype  we Facebook. It's insane. Almost every aspect of human communication's been changed  and of course that's had an impact on deception. Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we've been tracking and documenting. They're called the Butler  the Sock Puppet and the Chinese Water Army. It sounds a little bit like a weird book  but actually they're all new types of lies. Let's start with the Butlers. Here's an example of one   On my way.  Anybody ever written   On my way   Then you've also lied.  Laughter  We're never on our way. We're thinking about going on our way. Here's another one   Sorry I didn't respond to you earlier. My battery was dead.  Your battery wasn't dead. You weren't in a dead zone. You just didn't want to respond to that person that time. Here's the last one  You're talking to somebody  and you say   Sorry  got work  gotta go.  But really  you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else. Each of these is about a relationship  and this is a      connected world. Once you get my cell phone number  you can literally be in touch with me    hours a day. And so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer  like the butler used to do  between us and the connections to everybody else. But they're very special. They use ambiguity that comes from using technology. You don't know where I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with. And they're aimed at protecting the relationships. These aren't just people being jerks. These are people that are saying  look  I don't want to talk to you now  or I didn't want to talk to you then  but I still care about you. Our relationship is still important. Now  the Sock Puppet  on the other hand  is a totally different animal. The sock puppet isn't about ambiguity  per se. It's about identity. Let me give you a very recent example  as in  like  last week. Here's R.J. Ellory  best seller author in Britain. Here's one of his bestselling books. Here's a reviewer online  on Amazon. My favorite  by Nicodemus Jones  is   Whatever else it might do  it will touch your soul.  And of course  you might suspect that Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory. He wrote very  very positive reviews about himself. Surprise  surprise. Now this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new. Walt Whitman also did this back in the day  before there was Internet technology. Sock Puppet becomes interesting when we get to scale  which is the domain of the Chinese Water Army. Chinese Water Army refers to thousands of people in China that are paid small amounts of money to produce content. It could be reviews. It could be propaganda. The government hires these people  companies hire them  all over the place. In North America  we call this Astroturfing  and Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it. We see this especially with product reviews  book reviews  everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not. Now  looking at these three reviews  or these three types of deception  you might think  wow  the Internet is really making us a deceptive species  especially when you think about the Astroturfing  where we can see deception brought up to scale. But actually  what I've been finding is very different from that. Now  let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms  which I'm sure none of you have been in. I can assure you there's deception there. And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you about getting the    million out of the country.  Laughter  Let's forget about that guy  too. Let's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones. Those are the conversations that really matter. What does technology do to deception with those folks  Here's a couple of studies. One of the studies we do are called diary studies  in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days  and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium  and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media. And it really throws people for a loop because we think  well  there's no nonverbal cues  so why don't you lie more  The phone  in contrast  the most lies. Again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most  and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about. This tends to be very different from what people expect. What about r sum s  We did a study in which we had people apply for a job  and they could apply for a job either with a traditional paper r sum   or on LinkedIn  which is a social networking site like Facebook  but for professionals    involves the same information as a r sum . And what we found  to many people's surprise  was that those LinkedIn r sum s were more honest on the things that mattered to employers  like your responsibilities or your skills at your previous job. How about Facebook itself  You know  we always think that hey  there are these idealized versions  people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives. I've thought that many times. My friends  no way they can be that cool and have good of a life. Well  one study tested this by examining people's personalities. They had four good friends of a person judge their personality. Then they had strangers  many strangers  judge the person's personality just from Facebook  and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical  highly correlated  meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality. All right  well  what about online dating  I mean  that's a pretty deceptive space. I'm sure you all have  friends  that have used online dating.  Laughter  And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came  or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo. Well  we were really interested in it  and so what we did is we brought people  online daters  into the lab  and then we measured them. We got their height up against the wall  we put them on a scale  got their weight    ladies loved that    and then we actually got their driver's license to get their age. And what we found was very  very interesting. Here's an example of the men and the height. Along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile. Along the y axis  the vertical axis  is how tall they actually were. That diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it  they were telling exactly the truth. Now  as you see  most of the little dots are below the line. What it means is all the guys were lying about their height. In fact  they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch  what we say in the lab as  strong rounding up.   Laughter  You get to  '   and one tenth  and boom   '  . But what's really important here is  look at all those dots. They are clustering pretty close to the truth. What we found was    percent of our participants did indeed lie on one of those dimensions  but they always lied by a little bit. One of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date  a coffee date  and you're completely different than what you said  game over. Right  So people lied frequently  but they lied subtly  not too much. They were constrained. Well  what explains all these studies  What explains the fact that despite our intuitions  mine included  a lot of online communication  technologically mediated communication  is more honest than face to face  That really is strange. How do we explain this  Well  to do that  one thing is we can look at the deception detection literature. It's a very old literature by now  it's coming up on    years. It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials  hundreds of studies  and there's some really compelling findings. The first is  we're really bad at detecting deception  really bad. Fifty four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not. That's really bad. Why is it so bad  Well it has to do with Pinocchio's nose. If I were to ask you guys  what do you rely on when you're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they're lying  What cue do you pay attention to  Most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul. And you're not alone. Around the world  almost every culture  one of the top cues is eyes. But the research over the last    years says there's actually no reliable cue to deception  which blew me away  and it's one of the hard lessons that I learned when I was customs officer. The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not. Some situations  yes    high stakes  maybe their pupils dilate  their pitch goes up  their body movements change a little bit  but not all the time  not for everybody  it's not reliable. Strange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me doesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense  but one important finding is that we lie for a reason. We lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else's gain. So there are some pathological liars  but they make up a tiny portion of the population. We lie for a reason. Just because people can't see us doesn't mean we're going to necessarily lie. But I think there's actually something much more interesting and fundamental going on here. The next big thing for me  the next big idea  we can find by going way back in history to the origins of language. Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between        and         years ago. That's a long time ago. A lot of humans have lived since then. We've been talking  I guess  about fires and caves and saber toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about  but they were doing a lot of talking  and like I said  there's a lot of humans evolving speaking  about     billion people in fact. What's important though is that writing only emerged about       years ago. So what that means is that all the people before there was any writing  every word that they ever said  every utterance disappeared. No trace. Evanescent. Gone. So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record. In fact  even the next big change to writing was only     years ago now  with the printing press  which is very recent in our past  and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II  so even the people of the last two millennia  most of the words they ever said    poof     disappeared. Let's turn to now  the networked age. How many of you have recorded something today  Anybody do any writing today  Did anybody write a word  It looks like almost every single person here recorded something. In this room  right now  we've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre ancient history. That is crazy. We're entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear  but we're in an environment where we're recording everything. In fact  I think in the very near future  it's not just what we write that will be recorded  everything we do will be recorded. What does that mean  What's the next big idea from that  Well  as a social scientist  this is the most amazing thing I have ever even dreamed of. Now  I can look at all those words that used to  for millennia  disappear. I can look at lies that before were said and then gone. You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before  Well  when they write a fake review  they have to post it somewhere  and it's left behind for us. So one thing that we did  and I'll give you an example of looking at the language  is we paid people to write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake. The person never was at the James Hotel. The other review is real. The person stayed there. Now  your task now is to decide which review is fake  I'll give you a moment to read through them. But I want everybody to raise their hand at some point. Remember  I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand. All right  how many of you believe that A is the fake  All right. Very good. About half. And how many of you think that B is  All right. Slightly more for B. Excellent. Here's the answer. B is a fake. Well done second group. You dominated the first group.  Laughter  You're actually a little bit unusual. Every time we demonstrate this  it's usually about a       split  which fits with the research     percent. Maybe people here in Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out. Those cold  hard winters  I love it. All right  so why do I care about this  Well  what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception. Let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think about narrative. They make up a story  Who  And what happened  And that's what happened here. Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing. They also used the first person singular  I  way more than the people that actually stayed there. They were inserting themselves into the hotel review  kind of trying to convince you they were there. In contrast  the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there  their bodies actually entered the physical space  they talked a lot more about spatial information. They said how big the bathroom was  or they said  you know  here's how far shopping is from the hotel. Now  you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task. Our computer algorithm is very accurate  much more accurate than humans can be  and it's not going to be accurate all the time. This isn't a deception detection machine to tell if your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging. We believe that every lie now  every type of lie    fake hotel reviews  fake shoe reviews  your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging    those are all different lies. They're going to have different patterns of language. But because everything's recorded now  we can look at all of those kinds of lies. Now  as I said  as a social scientist  this is wonderful. It's transformational. We're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and expression  about everything from love to attitudes  because everything is being recorded now  but what does it mean for the average citizen  What does it mean for us in our lives  Well  let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas  I believe  is that we're leaving these huge traces behind. My outbox for email is massive  and I never look at it. I write all the time  but I never look at my record  at my trace. And I think we're going to see a lot more of that  where we can reflect on who we are by looking at what we wrote  what we said  what we did. Now  if we bring it back to deception  there's a couple of take away things here. First  lying online can be very dangerous  right  Not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine  but you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to  and you're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms. So by all means  go ahead and do that  that's good. But when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives  I think we can go back to Diogenes and Confucius. And they were less concerned about whether to lie or not to lie  and more concerned about being true to the self  and I think this is really important. Now  when you are about to say or do something  we can think  do I want this to be part of my legacy  part of my personal record  Because in the digital age we live in now  in the networked age  we are all leaving a record. Thank you so much for your time  and good luck with your record.  Applause  On my desk in my office  I keep a small clay pot that I made in college. It's raku  which is a kind of pottery that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony. This one is more than     years old. Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay  and it was the imperfections that people cherished. Everyday pots like this cup take eight to    hours to fire. I just took this out of the kiln last week  and the kiln itself takes another day or two to cool down  but raku is really fast. You do it outside  and you take the kiln up to temperature. In    minutes  it goes to       degrees  and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside  you can see that faint sheen  you turn the kiln off  and you reach in with these long metal tongs  you grab the pot  and in Japan  this red hot pot would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea  and you can imagine what that steam would smell like. But here in the United States  we ramp up the drama a little bit  and we drop our pots into sawdust  which catches on fire  and you take a garbage pail  and you put it on top  and smoke starts pouring out. I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke. I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements. I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze  but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke  and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen  like this crackle pattern  because it's really stressful on these pots. They go from       degrees to room temperature in the space of just a minute. Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity. I find in so many things that tension between what I can control and what I have to let go happens all the time  whether I'm creating a new radio show or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons. When I sat down to write a book about creativity  I realized that the steps were reversed. I had to let go at the very beginning  and I had to immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists and writers and musicians and filmmakers  and as I listened to these stories  I realized that creativity grows out of everyday experiences more often than you might think  including letting go. It was supposed to break  but that's okay.  Laughter   Laughs  That's part of the letting go  is sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't  because creativity also grows from the broken places. The best way to learn about anything is through stories  and so I want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspects of life that we need to embrace in order for our own creativity to flourish. The first embrace is something that we think   Oh  this is very easy   but it's actually getting harder  and that's paying attention to the world around us. So many artists speak about needing to be open  to embrace experience  and that's hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that takes all of your focus. The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up in a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar  and here's a picture of one of the temples in her town. Mira Nair  In this little town  there were like       temples. We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me  that led me on this path  that made me a filmmaker eventually  was traveling folk theater that would come through the town and I would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of  you know  passion  and hashish as well  and it was amazing. You know  the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana  the two holy books  the epics that everything comes out of in India  they say. After seeing that Jatra  the folk theater  I knew I wanted to get on  you know  and perform. Julie Burstein  Isn't that a wonderful story  You can see the sort of break in the everyday. There they are in the school fields  but it's good and evil  and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl with thousands of other people watching this performance  but she was ready. She was ready to open up to what it sparked in her  and it led her  as she said  down this path to become an award winning filmmaker. So being open for that experience that might change you is the first thing we need to embrace. Artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult. The novelist Richard Ford speaks about a childhood challenge that continues to be something he wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic. Richard Ford  I was slow to learn to read  went all the way through school not really reading more than the minimum  and still to this day can't read silently much faster than I can read aloud  but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me because when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow I was going to have to do it  then I think I came very slowly into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language and of sentences that are not just the cognitive aspects of language  the syncopations  the sounds of words  what words look like  where paragraphs break  where lines break. I mean  I wasn't so badly dyslexic that I was disabled from reading. I just had to do it really slowly  and as I did  lingering on those sentences as I had to linger  I fell heir to language's other qualities  which I think has helped me write sentences. JB  It's so powerful. Richard Ford  who's won the Pulitzer Prize  says that dyslexia helped him write sentences. He had to embrace this challenge  and I use that word intentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia. He had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music in language. Artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do  sometimes pushing into what they can't do  helps them focus on finding their own voice. The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how  as a young artist  he thought he was a painter  and he lived in Florence after graduate school. While he was there  he traveled to Madrid  where he went to the Prado to see this picture by the Spanish painter Diego Vel zquez. It's from       and it's called  Las Meninas   and it's the picture of a little princess and her ladies in waiting  and if you look over that little blonde princess's shoulder  you'll see a mirror  and reflected in it are her parents  the King and Queen of Spain  who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture. As he often did  Vel zquez put himself in this painting too. He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand and his palette in the other. Richard Serra  I was standing there looking at it  and I realized that Vel zquez was looking at me  and I thought   Oh. I'm the subject of the painting.  And I thought   I'm not going to be able to do that painting.  I was to the point where I was using a stopwatch and painting squares out of randomness  and I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped all my paintings in the Arno  and I thought  I'm going to just start playing around. JB  Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly  you might have missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy who'd been dead for     years  and realized   I can't do that   and so Richard Serra went back to his studio in Florence  picked up all of his work up to that point  and threw it in a river. Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment  but he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City  and he put together a list of verbs   to roll  to crease  to fold   more than a hundred of them  and as he said  he just started playing around. He did these things to all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead and roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing to rubber  and when he got to the direction  to lift   he created this  which is in the Museum of Modern Art. Richard Serra had to let go of painting in order to embark on this playful exploration that led him to the work that he's known for today  huge curves of steel that require our time and motion to experience. In sculpture  Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting. He makes us the subject of his art. So experience and challenge and limitations are all things we need to embrace for creativity to flourish. There's a fourth embrace  and it's the hardest. It's the embrace of loss  the oldest and most constant of human experiences. In order to create  we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for  looking squarely at rejection  at heartbreak  at war  at death. That's a tough space to stand in. The educator Parker Palmer calls it  the tragic gap   tragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable  and my friend Dick Nodel likes to say   You can hold that tension like a violin string and make something beautiful.  That tension resonates in the work of the photographer Joel Meyerowitz  who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photography  for capturing a moment on the street  and also for his beautiful photographs of landscapes    of Tuscany  of Cape Cod  of light. Joel is a New Yorker  and his studio for many years was in Chelsea  with a straight view downtown to the World Trade Center  and he photographed those buildings in every sort of light. You know where this story goes. On       Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town  but he raced back to the city  and raced down to the site of the destruction. Joel Meyerowitz  And like all the other passersby  I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers and Greenwich  and all I could see was the smoke and a little bit of rubble  and I raised my camera to take a peek  just to see if there was something to see  and some cop  a lady cop  hit me on my shoulder  and said   Hey  no pictures   And it was such a blow that it woke me up  in the way that it was meant to be  I guess. And when I asked her why no pictures  she said   It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed.  And I asked her   What would happen if I was a member of the press   And she told me   Oh  look back there   and back a block was the press corps tied up in a little penned in area  and I said   Well  when do they go in   and she said   Probably never.  And as I walked away from that  I had this crystallization  probably from the blow  because it was an insult in a way. I thought   Oh  if there's no pictures  then there'll be no record. We need a record.  And I thought   I'm gonna make that record. I'll find a way to get in  because I don't want to see this history disappear.  JB  He did. He pulled in every favor he could  and got a pass into the World Trade Center site  where he photographed for nine months almost every day. Looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night. My office was just a few blocks away. But some of these photographs are beautiful  and we wondered  was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitz to make such beauty out of such devastation  JM  Well  you know  ugly  I mean  powerful and tragic and horrific and everything  but it was also as  in nature  an enormous event that was transformed after the fact into this residue  and like many other ruins   you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace   and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather. I mean  there were afternoons I was down there  and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air and you're standing in the rubble  and I found myself recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature  as time  is erasing this wound. Time is unstoppable  and it transforms the event. It gets further and further away from the day  and light and seasons temper it in some way  and it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist. The reality is  there's the Woolworth Building in a veil of smoke from the site  but it's now like a scrim across a theater  and it's turning pink  you know  and down below there are hoses spraying  and the lights have come on for the evening  and the water is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on  and I'm thinking   My God  who could dream this up   But the fact is  I'm there  it looks like that  you have to take a picture. JB  You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency  of the need to get to work  is so powerful in Joel's story. When I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently  I told him how much I admired his passionate obstinacy  his determination to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work  and he laughed  and he said   I'm stubborn  but I think what's more important is my passionate optimism.  The first time I told these stories  a man in the audience raised his hand and said   All these artists talk about their work  not their art  which has got me thinking about my work and where the creativity is there  and I'm not an artist.  He's right. We all wrestle with experience and challenge  limits and loss. Creativity is essential to all of us  whether we're scientists or teachers  parents or entrepreneurs. I want to leave you with another image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one is at the Freer Gallery in Washington  D.C. It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it. But as you can also see  this one did break at some point in its hundred years. But the person who put it back together  instead of hiding the cracks  decided to emphasize them  using gold lacquer to repair it. This bowl is more beautiful now  having been broken  than it was when it was first made  and we can look at those cracks  because they tell the story that we all live  of the cycle of creation and destruction  of control and letting go  of picking up the pieces and making something new. Thank you.  Applause  So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife. It makes me to stand here  the fame  the money I got out of it. So what I did  I'd gone back to my early marriage days. What you did in the early marriage days  you tried to impress your wife. I did the same. On that occasion  I found my wife carrying something like this. I saw.  What is that   I asked. My wife replied   None of your business.  Then  being her husband  I ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth. I don't even use that cloth to clean my two wheeler. Then I understood this    adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days. Then I immediately asked her  why are you  using  that unhygienic method  She replied  I also know about  sanitary pads   but myself and my sisters  if they start using that  we have to cut our family milk budget. Then I was shocked. What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget  And it's called affordability. I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads. I went to a local shop  I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet. That fellow looks left and right  and spreads a newspaper  rolls it into the newspaper  gives it to me like a banned item  something like that. I don't know why. I did not ask for a condom. Then I took that pad. I want to see that. What is inside it  The very first time  at the age of     that day I am touching the sanitary pad  first ever. I must know  How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad  They are not going to touch that  because it's not your matter. Then I thought to myself  white substance  made of cotton    oh my God  that guy is just using a penny value of raw material    inside they are selling for pounds  dollars. Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife  That's how all this started  but after making a sanitary pad  where can I check it  It's not like I can just check it in the lab. I need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India  Even in Bangalore you won't get  one   in India. So only problem  the only available victim is my wife. Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti    my wife's name is Shanti.  Close your eyes. Whatever I give  it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring  even a chocolate  I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it. Close your eyes.  Because I tried to make it intimate. Because it's an arranged marriage  not a love marriage. So one day she said  openly  I'm not going to support this research. Then other victims  they got into my sisters. But even sisters  wives  they're not ready to support in the research. That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India. They are having a lot of women volunteers around them. Why I am not getting  any   You know  without them even calling  they'll get a lot of women volunteers. Then I used  tried to use the medical college girls. They also refused. Finally  I decide  use sanitary pad myself. Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon. Armstrong. Then Tenzing  and  Hillary  in Everest  like that Muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe. I wore a sanitary pad. I filled animal blood in a football bottle  I tied it up here  there is a tube going into my panties  while I'm walking  while I'm cycling  I made a press  doses of blood will go there. That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect. That five days I'll never forget    the messy days  the lousy days  that wetness. My God  it's unbelievable. But here the problem is  one company is making napkin out of cotton. It is working well. But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton. It's not working. That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research. You need first funds. Not only financial crises  but because of the sanitary pad research  I come through all sorts of problems  including a divorce notice from my wife. Why is this  I used medical college girls. She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls. Finally  I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood  but even after that  you need a multimillion dollar plant like this to process that material. Again  a stop up. Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools  a simple machine tool like this. In this machine  any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant  anyone can make a world class napkin at your dining hall. That is my invention. So after that  what I did  usually if anyone got a patent or an invention  immediately you want to make  convert into this. I never did this. I dropped it just like this  because you do this  if anyone runs after money  their life will not  have  any beauty. It is boredom. A lot of people making a lot of money  billion  billions of dollars accumulating. Why are they coming for  finally  for philanthropy  Why the need for accumulating money  then doing philanthropy  What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one  That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India  for rural women  because in India   you'll be  surprised  only two percent of women are using sanitary pads. The rest  they're using a rag cloth  a leaf  husk   saw  dust  everything except sanitary pads. It is the same in the   st century. That's why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India. So far      installations happened in    states in six other countries. Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against multinational  transnational giants    makes all MBA students a question mark. A school dropout from Coimbatore  how he is able to sustaining  That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs. Play video one. She replied immediately   I know about napkins  but if I start using napkins  then we have to cut our family milk budget.  Why not make myself a low cost napkin  So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups. That is my idea. AM  And previously  you need a multimillion investment for machine and all. Now  any rural woman can. They are performing puja. You just think  competing giants  even from Harvard  Oxford  is difficult. I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals. I'm sustaining on seventh year. Already     installations. What is my mission  I'm going to make India  into  a     percent sanitary napkin using country in my lifetime. In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I'm going to create. That's why I'm not running after this bloody money. I'm doing something serious. If you chase a girl  the girl won't like you. Do your job simply  the girl will chase you. Like that  I never chased Mahalakshmi. Mahalakshmi is chasing me  I am keeping in the back pocket. Not in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man. That's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad. I am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy. I don't want to make this as a corporate entity. I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe. That's why I put all the details on public domain like an open software. Now     countries are accessing it. Okay  So I classify the people into three  uneducated  little educated  surplus educated. Little educated  done this. Surplus educated  what are you going to do for the society  Thank you very much. Bye  I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day  and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email  in Facebook  in texting or cell phones in general. And so while other kids were BBM ing their parents  I was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone  which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital  but I was just looking for some sort of scribble  some unkempt cursive from my mother. And so when I moved to New York City after college and got completely sucker punched in the face by depression  I did the only thing I could think of at the time. I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me for strangers  and tucked them all throughout the city  dozens and dozens of them. I left them everywhere  in cafes and in libraries  at the U.N.  everywhere. I blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary  and I posed a kind of crazy promise to the Internet  that if you asked me for a hand written letter  I would write you one  no questions asked. Overnight  my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak    a single mother in Sacramento  a girl being bullied in rural Kansas  all asking me  a    year old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order  to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox. Well  today I fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox  fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most  but most of all  fueled by crates of mail like this one  my trusty mail crate  filled with the scriptings of ordinary people  strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee  but because they have found one another by way of letter writing. But  you know  the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper. They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters. They're the ones from my generation  the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is paperless  and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen. We have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook  and we speak swiftly in     characters or less. But what if it's not about efficiency this time  I was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate  which is a conversation starter  let me tell you. If you ever need one  just carry one of these.  Laughter  And a man just stared at me  and he was like   Well  why don't you use the Internet   And I thought   Well  sir  I am not a strategist  nor am I specialist. I am merely a storyteller.  And so I could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan  and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation  and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say   Come back to me. Find me when you can.  Or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters around her campus in Dubuque  Iowa  only to find her efforts ripple effected the next day when she walks out onto the quad and finds love letters hanging from the trees  tucked in the bushes and the benches. Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life  uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family. Well  tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow  scripted by strangers who were there for him when. These are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency  because she is an art form now  all the parts of her  the signing  the scripting  the mailing  the doodles in the margins. The mere fact that somebody would even just sit down  pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through  with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone is pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once  that is an art form that does not fall down to the Goliath of  get faster   no matter how many social networks we might join. We still clutch close these letters to our chest  to the words that speak louder than loud  when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say  the words that we have needed to write  to sisters and brothers and even to strangers  for far too long. Thank you.  Applause  Today  I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics. I'm  among several other things  an electrical engineer  and that means that I spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology  and more specifically designing and building electronics. And what I've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways. So it's a really slow process  it's really expensive  and the outcome of that process  namely electronic circuit boards  are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways. So they're really small  generally  they're square and flat and hard  and frankly  most of them just aren't very attractive  and so my team and I have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics. And so what if you could design and build electronics like this  So what if you could do it extremely quickly  extremely inexpensively  and maybe more interestingly  really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally  Wouldn't that be so cool  and that wouldn't that open up all sorts of new possibilities  I'm going to share with you two projects that are investigations along these lines  and we'll start with this one. A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC. Sticker templates. Speed x  . Making a switch. Music  DJ Shadow. Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller. Sketching an interface. Pretty cool  huh  We think so. So now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things  we started to realize that  essentially  anything that we can do with paper  anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics. So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that possibility. And I'll kind of let it speak for itself. So the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this  and so the way that we're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools  and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways. And so sometime soon  you'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way. So thank you very much.  Applause  Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney. I got to the airport  to the hotel  checked in  and  sitting there in the lobby  was a brochure for the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it  and I came across a show called  Minto  Live.  The description read   The suburban streets of Minto become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of Minto.  What was this place called Minto  Sydney  as I would learn  is a city of suburbs  and Minto lies southwest  about an hour away. I have to say  it wasn't exactly what I had in mind for my first day down under. I mean  I'd thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach  but Minto  But still  I'm a producer  and the lure of a site specific theater project was more than I could resist.  Laughter  So  off I went into Friday afternoon traffic  and I'll never forget what I saw when I got there. For the performance  the audience walked around the neighborhood from house to house  and the residents  who were the performers  they came out of their houses  and they performed these autobiographical dances on their lawns  on their driveways.  Laughter  The show is a collaboration with a U.K. based performance company called Lone Twin. Lone Twin had come to Minto and worked with the residents  and they had created these dances. This Australian Indian girl  she came out and started to dance on her front lawn  and her father peered out the window to see what all the noise and commotion was about  and he soon joined her. And he was followed by her little sister. And soon they were all dancing this joyous  exuberant dance right there on their lawn.  Laughter  And as I walked through the neighborhood  I was amazed and I was moved by the incredible sense of ownership this community clearly felt about this event.  Minto  Live  brought Sydneysiders into dialogue with international artists  and really celebrated the diversity of Sydney on its own terms. The Sydney Festival which produced  Minto  Live  I think represents a new kind of   st century arts festival. These festivals are radically open. They can transform cities and communities. To understand this  I think it kind of makes sense to look where we've come from. Modern arts festivals were born in the rubble of World War II. Civic leaders created these annual events to celebrate culture as the highest expression of the human spirit. In       the Edinburgh Festival was born and Avignon was born and hundreds of others would follow in their wake. The work they did was very  very high art  and stars came along like Laurie Anderson and Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage who made work for this circuit  and you had these seminal shows like  The Mahabharata  and the monumental  Einstein on the Beach.  But as the decades passed  these festivals  they really became the establishment  and as the culture and capital accelerated  the Internet brought us all together  high and low kind of disappeared  a new kind of festival emerged. The old festivals  they continued to thrive  but from Brighton to Rio to Perth  something new was emerging  and these festivals were really different. They're open  these festivals  because  like in Minto  they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential. They're open because they ask the audience to be a player  a protagonist  a partner  rather than a passive spectator  and they're open because they know that imagination cannot be contained in buildings  and so much of the work they do is site specific or outdoor work. So  the new festival  it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance. Companies like De La Guarda  which I produce  and Punchdrunk create these completely immersive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action  but the German performance company Rimini Protokoll takes this all to a whole new level. In a series of shows that includes      Percent Vancouver        Percent Berlin   Rimini Protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society. Rimini Protokoll chooses     people that represent that city at that moment in terms of race and gender and class  through a careful process that begins three months before  and then those     people share stories about themselves and their lives  and the whole thing becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment. LIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues. They understand that theater and performance can happen anywhere. You can do a show in a schoolroom  in an airport     Laughter    in a department store window. Artists are explorers. Who better to show us the city anew  Artists can take us to a far flung part of the city that we haven't explored  or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into. An artist  I think  can really show us people that we might overlook in our lives. Back to Back is an Australian company of people with intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing show in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal at rush hour. We  the audience  were given headsets and seated on one side of the terminal. The actors were right there in front of us  right there among the commuters  and we could hear them  but we might not have otherwise seen them. So Back to Back takes site specific theater and uses it to gently remind us about who and what we choose to edit out of our daily lives. So  the dialogue with the local and the global  the audience as participant and player and protagonist  the innovative use of site  all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe. Royal de Luxe's giant puppets come into a city and they live there for a few days. For  The Sultan's Elephant   Royal de Luxe came to central London and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend  a time traveling elephant. For a few days  they transformed a massive city into a community where endless possibility reigned. The Guardian wrote   If art is about transformation  then there can be no more transformative experience. What 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less than an artistic occupation of the city and a reclamation of the streets for the people.  We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals on their cities  but I'm much  more  interested in many more things  like how a festival helps a city to express itself  how it lets it come into its own. Festivals promote diversity  they bring neighbors into dialogue  they increase creativity  they offer opportunities for civic pride  they improve our general psychological well being. In short  they make cities better places to live. Case in point  When  The Sultan's Elephant  came to London just nine months after      a Londoner wrote   For the first time since the London bombings  my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice. She had gathered with others to watch 'The Sultan's Elephant ' and  you know  it just made all the difference.  Lyn Gardner in The Guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world  a map of the city and a map of ourselves  but there is no one fixed festival model. I think what's so brilliant about the festivals  the new festivals  is that they are really fully capturing the complexity and the excitement of the way we all live today. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'm a brain scientist  and as a brain scientist  I'm actually interested in how the brain learns  and I'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter  better and faster. This is in this context I'm going to tell you about video games. When we say video games  most of you think about children. It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games. But let's be frank. When the kids are in bed  who is in front of the PlayStation  Most of you. The average age of a gamer is    years old  not eight years old  and in fact  if we look at the projected demographics of video game play  the video game players of tomorrow are older adults.  Laughter  So video  gaming  is pervasive throughout our society. It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact on our everyday life. Consider these statistics released by Activision. After one month of release of the game  Call Of Duty  Black Ops   it had been played for        years worldwide  right  Would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra  So what we are asking in the lab is  how can we leverage that power  Now I want to step back a bit. I know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games. after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you  right  And I'm almost sure most of you have thought   Oh  come on  can't you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies   I'd like you to put this kind of knee jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right  Most parents would find that great. Well  I'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health. It's not  and binging is never good. But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses  actually the very game I showed you at the beginning  those action packed shooter games have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior. There's not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you  right  You're all bombarded with that. I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab. What we do in the lab is actually measure directly  in a quantitative fashion  what is the impact of video games on the brain. And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work. One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse. That's a statement about vision. There may be vision scientists among you. We actually know how to test that statement. We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is. Well  guess what  People that don't play a lot of action games  that don't actually spend a lot of time in front of screens  have normal  or what we call corrective to normal vision. That's okay. The issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week     hours per week     hours per week. By that statement  their vision should be really bad  right  Guess what  Their vision is really  really good. It's better than those that don't play. And it's better in two different ways. The first way is that they're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter  and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses  you can actually do it with just your eyesight. The other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray. Imagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident  or getting into an accident. So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision  and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better. Clearly  when it comes to action video games  screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse. Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around  Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability. Okay  we know how to measure attention in the lab. I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so. I'm going to ask you to participate  so you're going to have to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink. Right  So this is the first example.   Chair   Orange  good.   Table   Green.   Board   Audience  Red.Daphne Bavelier  Red.   Horse   DB  Yellow. Audience  Yellow.   Yellow   DB  Red. Audience  Yellow.   Blue   DB  Yellow. Okay  you get my point  right   Laughter  You're getting better  but it's hard. Why is it hard  Because I introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color. How good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict  so the young guys here at the top of their game probably  like  did a little better than some of us that are older. What we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games  they actually resolve the conflict faster. So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead to attention problems. Actually  those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention  and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world. This is something we use all the time. When you're driving  you're tracking  keeping track of the cars around you. You're also keeping track of the pedestrian  the running dog  and that's how you can actually be safe driving  right  In the lab  we get people to come to the lab  sit in front of a computer screen  and we give them little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again. You're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces. These are children in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess during the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess. But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat. Everybody begins to move around  and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes. You can track  you can track  and then when it stops  and there is a question mark  and I ask you  did this kid have a coat or not  Was it yellow initially or blue  I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain.  Laughter  I'm now going to ask you to do the task  but now with a little more challenging task. There are going to be three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes. Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated and expand  pull your attention. That's the only way you can actually do it. If you move your eyes  you're doomed. Yellow or blue  Audience  Yellow.DB  Good. So your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention. That's what we just did. Your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention  which is what is shown in this video here. That's for you guys  action video game players. A bit more challenging  right   Laughter  Yellow or blue  Blue. We have some people that are serious out there. Yeah.  Laughter  Good. So in the same way that we actually see the effects of video games on people's behavior  we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain  and we do find many changes  but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention. The other one is the frontal lobe  which controls how we sustain attention  and another one is the anterior cingulate  which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict. Now  when we do brain imaging  we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games. This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain. You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty of multitasking when you're driving and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea. Why  Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone  you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you  and so you're much more likely to get engaged into a car accident. Now  we can measure that kind of skills in the lab. We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have. That would be a little costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer where we can measure  to millisecond accuracy  how good they are at switching from one task to another. When we do that  we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really  really good. They switch really fast  very swiftly. They pay a very small cost. Now I'd like you to remember that result  and put it in the context of another group of technology users  a group which is actually much revered by society  which are people that engage in multimedia tasking. What is multimedia tasking  It's the fact that most of us  most of our children  are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they're doing search on the web at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends. That's a multimedia tasker. There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high multimedia taskers are absolutely abysmal at multitasking. When we measure them in the lab  they're really bad. Right  So these kinds of results really makes two main points. The first one is that not all media are created equal. You can't compare the effect of multimedia tasking and the effect of playing action games. They have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition  perception and attention. Even within video games  I'm telling you right now about these action packed video games. Different video games have a different effect on your brains. So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game. The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight. I showed that to you already  like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time  those action gamers have a lot of very good vision  etc. Here  what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high multimedia tasking are convinced they aced the test. So you show them their data  you show them they are bad and they're like   Not possible.  You know  they have this sort of gut feeling that  really  they are doing really  really good. That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain. Now in a sense  when we think about the effect of video games on the brain  it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health. There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some very poor uses of video games. But when consumed in reasonable doses  and at the right age  wine can be very good for health. There are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy. So it's the same way  like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity  learning  attention  vision  etc.  and so we need and we're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games  either for education or for rehabilitation of patients. Now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients  we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform. I'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game  I can actually change your vision for the better  whether you want to play that action game or not  right  That's the point of rehabilitation or education. Most of the kids don't go to school saying   Great  two hours of math   So that's really the crux of the research  and to do that  we need to go one more step. And one more step is to do training studies. So let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation. Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you  and again you're going to do the task  to look at this shape. Study it  it's a target shape  and I'm going to present to you four different shapes. One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one  the first one  second one  third one or fourth one  Okay  I'll help you. Fourth one. One more. Get those brains working. Come on. That's our target shape. Third. Good  This is hard  right  Like  the reason that I asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing  right  It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games. Well  what we do in these training studies is  people come to the lab  they do tasks like this one  we then force them to play    hours of action games. They don't play    hours of action games in a row. They do distributed practice  so little shots of    minutes several days over a period of two weeks. Then  once they are done with the training  they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague in Toronto. What they showed is that  initially  you know  subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age. After two weeks of training on action video games  they actually perform better  and the improvement is still there five months after having done the training. That's really  really important. Why  Because I told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects that are going to be long lasting. Now  at this point  a number of you are probably wondering well  what are you waiting for  to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy  or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia  for example  Well  we're working on it  but here is a challenge. There are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects  and that's what I'm going to call the broccoli side of the equation. There is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can't resist. That's the chocolate side of the equation. The issue is we need to put the two together  and it's a little bit like with food. Who really wants to eat chocolate covered broccoli  None of you.  Laughter  And you probably have had that feeling  right  picking up an education game and sort of feeling  hmm  you know  it's not really fun  it's not really engaging. So what we need is really a new brand of chocolate  a brand of chocolate that is irresistible  that you really want to play  but that has all the ingredients  the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it  but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together  people that work in the entertainment software industry  and publishers  so these are not people that usually meet every day  but it's actually doable  and we are on the right track. I'd like to leave you with that thought  and thank you for your attention.  Applause  Living with a physical disability isn't easy anywhere in the world  but if you live in a country like the United States  there's certain appurtenances available to you that do make life easier. So if you're in a building  you can take an elevator. If you're crossing the street  you have sidewalk cutouts. And if you have to travel some distance farther than you can do under your own power  there's accessible vehicles  and if you can't afford one of those  there's accessible public transportation. But in the developing world  things are quite different. There's    million people who need a wheelchair but don't have one  and the majority of these people live in rural areas  where the only connections to community  to employment  to education  are by traveling long distances on rough terrain often under their own power. And the devices usually available to these people are not made for that context  break down quickly  and are hard to repair. I started looking at wheelchairs in developing countries in       when I spent the summer assessing the state of technology in Tanzania  and I talked to wheelchair users  wheelchair manufacturers  disability groups  and what stood out to me is that there wasn't a device available that was designed for rural areas  that could go fast and efficiently on many types of terrain. So being a mechanical engineer  being at MIT and having lots of resources available to me  I thought I'd try to do something about it. Now when you're talking about trying to travel long distances on rough terrain  I immediately thought of a mountain bike  and a mountain bike's good at doing this because it has a gear train  and you can shift to a low gear if you have to climb a hill or go through mud or sand and you get a lot of torque but a low speed. And if you want to go faster  say on pavement  you can shift to a high gear  and you get less torque  but higher speeds. So the logical evolution here is to just make a wheelchair with mountain bike components  which many people have done. But these are two products available in the U.S. that would be difficult to transfer into developing countries because they're much  much too expensive. And the context I'm talking about is where you need to have a product that is less than     dollars. And this ideal product would also be able to go about five kilometers a day so you could get to your job  get to school  and do it on many  many different types of terrain. But when you get home or want to go indoors at your work  it's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside. And furthermore  if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas  it has to be repairable using the local tools  materials and knowledge in those contexts. So the real crux of the problem here is  how do you make a system that's a simple device but gives you a large mechanical advantage  How do you make a mountain bike for your arms that doesn't have the mountain bike cost and complexity  So as is the case with simple solutions  oftentimes the answer is right in front of your face  and for us it was levers. We use levers all the time  in tools  doorknobs  bicycle parts. And that moment of inspiration  that key invention moment  was when I was sitting in front of my design notebook and I started thinking about somebody grabbing a lever  and if they grab near the end of the lever  they can get an effectively long lever and produce a lot of torque as they push back and forth  and effectively get a low gear. And as they slide their hand down the lever  they can push with a smaller effective lever length  but push through a bigger angle every stroke  which makes a faster rotational speed  and gives you an effective high gear. So what's exciting about this system is that it's really  really mechanically simple  and you could make it using technology that's been around for hundreds of years. So seeing this in practice  this is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that  after a few years of development  we're now going into production with  and this is a full time wheelchair user    he's paralyzed    in Guatemala  and you see he's able to traverse pretty rough terrain. Again  the key innovation of this technology is that when he wants to go fast  he just grabs the levers near the pivots and goes through a big angle every stroke  and as the going gets tougher  he just slides his hands up the levers  creates more torque  and kind of bench presses his way out of trouble through the rough terrain. Now the big  important point here is that the person is the complex machine in this system. It's the person that's sliding his hands up and down the levers  so the mechanism itself can be very simple and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world. Because those bicycle parts are so ubiquitously available  they're super cheap. They're made by the gazillions in China and India  and we can source them anywhere in the world  build the chair anywhere  and most importantly repair it  even out in a village with a local bicycle mechanic who has local tools  knowledge and parts available. Now  when you want to use the LFC indoors  all you have to do is pull the levers out of the drivetrain  stow them in the frame  and it converts into a normal wheelchair that you can use just like any other normal wheelchair  and we sized it like a normal wheelchair  so it's narrow enough to fit through a standard doorway  it's low enough to fit under a table  and it's small and maneuverable enough to fit in a bathroom and this is important so the user can get up close to a toilet  and be able to transfer off just like he could in a normal wheelchair. Now  there's three important points that I want to stress that I think really hit home in this project. The first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user centered design focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries. So I'm an academic at MIT  and I'm a mechanical engineer  so I can do things like look at the type of terrain you want to travel on  and figure out how much resistance it should impose  look at the parts we have available and mix and match them to figure out what sort of gear trains we can use  and then look at the power and force you can get out of your upper body to analyze how fast you should be able to go in this chair as you put your arms up and down the levers. So as a wet behind the ears student  excited  our team made a prototype  brought that prototype to Tanzania  Kenya and Vietnam in       and found it was terrible because we didn't get enough input from users. So because we tested it with wheelchair users  with wheelchair manufacturers  we got that feedback from them  not just articulating their problems  but articulating their solutions  and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design  which we brought back to East Africa in '   that worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain  but it still didn't work well indoors because it was too big  it was heavy  it was hard to move around  so again with that user feedback  we went back to the drawing board  came up with a better design     pounds lighter  as narrow as a regular wheelchair  tested that in a field trial in Guatemala  and that advanced the product to the point where we have now that it's going into production. Now also being engineering scientists  we were able to quantify the performance benefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair  so here are some shots of our trial in Guatemala where we tested the LFC on village terrain  and tested people's biomechanical outputs  their oxygen consumption  how fast they go  how much power they're putting out  both in their regular wheelchairs and using the LFC  and we found that the LFC is about    percent faster going on these terrains than a normal wheelchair. It's also about    percent more efficient than a regular wheelchair  and because of the mechanical advantage you get from the levers  you can produce    percent higher torque and really muscle your way through the really  really rough terrain. Now the second lesson that we learned in this is that the constraints on this design really push the innovation  because we had to hit such a low price point  because we had to make a device that could travel on many  many types of terrain but still be usable indoors  and be simple enough to repair  we ended up with a fundamentally new product  a new product that is an innovation in a space that really hasn't changed in a hundred years. And these are all merits that are not just good in the developing world. Why not in countries like the U.S. too  So we teamed up with Continuum  a local product design firm here in Boston to make the high end version  the developed world version  that we'll probably sell primarily in the U.S. and Europe  but to higher income buyers. And the final point I want to make is that I think this project worked well because we engaged all the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider in bringing the technology from inception of an idea through innovation  validation  commercialization and dissemination  and that cycle has to start and end with end users. These are the people that define the requirements of the technology  and these are the people that have to give the thumbs up at the end  and say   Yeah  it actually works. It meets our needs.  So people like me in the academic space  we can do things like innovate and analyze and test  create data and make bench level prototypes  but how do you get that bench level prototype to commercialization  So we need gap fillers like Continuum that can work on commercializing  and we started a whole NGO to bring our chair to market    Global Research Innovation Technology    and then we also teamed up with a big manufacturer in India  Pinnacle Industries  that's tooled up now to make     chairs a month and will make the first batch of     next month  which will be delivered in India. And then finally  to get this out to the people in scale  we teamed up with the largest disability organization in the world  Jaipur Foot. Now what's powerful about this model is when you bring together all these stakeholders that represent each link in the chain from inception of an idea all the way to implementation in the field  that's where the magic happens. That's where you can take a guy like me  an academic  but analyze and test and create a new technology and quantitatively determine how much better the performance is. You can connect with stakeholders like the manufacturers and talk with them face to face and leverage their local knowledge of manufacturing practices and their clients and combine that knowledge with our engineering knowledge to create something greater than either of us could have done alone. And then you can also engage the end user in the design process  and not just ask him what he needs  but ask him how he thinks it can be achieved. And this picture was taken in India in our last field trial  where we had a    percent adoption rate where people switched to using our Leveraged Freedom Chair over their normal wheelchair  and this picture specifically is of Ashok  and Ashok had a spinal injury when he fell out of a tree  and he had been working at a tailor  but once he was injured he wasn't able to transport himself from his house over a kilometer to his shop in his normal wheelchair. The road was too rough. But the day after he got an LFC  he hopped in it  rode that kilometer  opened up his shop and soon after landed a contract to make school uniforms and started making money  started providing for his family again. Ashok  You also encouraged me to work. I rested for a day at home. The next day I went to my shop. Now everything is back to normal. Amos Winter  And thank you very much for having me today. When I graduated UCLA  I moved to northern California  and I lived in a little town called Elk on the Mendocino coast  and I didn't have a phone or TV  but I had U.S. mail  and life was good back then  if you could remember it. I'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie  and I'd ship my film to San Francisco  and lo and behold  two days later  it would end up on my front door  which was way better than having to fight the traffic of Hollywood.  Music  I didn't have much money  but I had time and a sense of wonder.  Music  So I started shooting time lapse photography. It would take me a month to shoot a four minute roll of film  because that's all I could afford. I've been shooting time lapse flowers continuously  non stop     hours a day  seven days a week  for over    years  and to see them move is a dance I'll never get tired of. Their beauty immerses us with color  taste  touch. It also provides a third of the food we eat. Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival  because we protect what we fall in love with. It opens our hearts  and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it. When we see ourselves in nature  it also connects us to every one of us  because it's clear that it's all connected in one. When people see my images  a lot of times they'll say   Oh my God.  Have you ever wondered what that meant  The  oh  means it caught your attention  makes you present  makes you mindful. The  my  means it connects with something deep inside your soul. It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard. And  God   God is that personal journey we all want to be on  to be inspired  to feel like we're connected to a universe that celebrates life. Did you know that    percent of the information we receive comes through our eyes  And if you compare light energy to musical scales  it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see  which is right in the middle  And aren't we grateful for our brains that can  you know  take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy to create images in order for us to explore our world  And aren't we grateful that we have hearts that can feel these vibrations in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature  Nature's beauty is a gift that cultivates appreciation and gratitude. So I have a gift I want to share with you today  a project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed  and it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man of that world. Child  When I watch TV  it's just some shows that you just    that are pretend  and when you explore  you get more imagination than you already had  and when you get more imagination  it makes you want to go deeper in so you can get more and see beautifuller things  like the path  if it's a path  it could lead you to a beach  or something  and it could be beautiful. Elderly Man  You think this is just another day in your life  It's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you today. It's given to you. It's a gift. It's the only gift that you have right now  and the only appropriate response is gratefulness. If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift that this unique day is  if you learn to respond as if it were the first day in your life and the very last day  then you will have spent this day very well. Begin by opening your eyes and be surprised that you have eyes you can open  that incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us for pure enjoyment. Look at the sky. We so rarely look at the sky. We so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment  with clouds coming and going. We just think of the weather  and even with the weather  we don't think of all the many nuances of weather. We just think of good weather and bad weather. This day  right now  has unique weather  maybe a kind that will never exactly in that form come again. That formation of clouds in the sky will never be the same as it is right now. Open your eyes. Look at that. Look at the faces of people whom you meet. Each one has an incredible story behind their face  a story that you could never fully fathom  not only their own story  but the story of their ancestors. We all go back so far  and in this present moment  on this day  all the people you meet  all that life from generations and from so many places all over the world flows together and meets you here like a life giving water  if you only open your heart and drink. Open your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization gives to us. You flip a switch and there is electric light. You turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water  and drinkable water. It's a gift that millions and millions in the world will never experience. So these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts to which we can open your heart. And so I wish you that you will open your heart to all these blessings  and let them flow through you  that everyone whom you will meet on this day will be blessed by you  just by your eyes  by your smile  by your touch  just by your presence. Let the gratefulness overflow into blessing all around you  and then it will really be a good day.  Music  Louie Schwartzberg  Thank you. Thank you very much.  Applause  There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives. We don't bump into every neighbor  so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on  though we do share the same public spaces. So over the past few years  I've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space  using simple tools like stickers  stencils and chalk. And these projects came from questions I had  like  How much are my neighbors paying for their apartments  How can we lend and borrow more things  without knocking on each other's doors at a bad time  How can we share more memories of our abandoned buildings  and gain a better understanding of our landscape  How can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts  so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today  Now  I live in New Orleans  and I am in love with New Orleans. My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees  shading lovers  drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years  and I trust a city that always makes way for music. I feel like every time someone sneezes  New Orleans has a parade. The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world  but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America. I live near this house  and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood  and I also thought about something that changed my life forever. In       I lost someone I loved very much. Her name was Joan  and she was a mother to me. And her death was sudden and unexpected. And I thought about death a lot. And ... this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had. And ... brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now. But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life. I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day to day  and forget what really matters to you. So with help from old and new friends  I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard  and stenciled it with a fill in the blank sentence   Before I die  I want to ...  So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk  reflect on their life  and share their personal aspirations in public space. I didn't know what to expect from this experiment  but by the next day  the wall was entirely filled out  and it kept growing. And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall.  Before I die  I want to be tried for piracy.   Before I die  I want to straddle the International Dateline.   Before I die  I want to sing for millions.   Before I die  I want to plant a tree.   Before I die  I want to live off the grid.   Before I die  I want to hold her one more time.   Before I die  I want to be someone's cavalry.   Before I die  I want to be completely myself.  So this neglected space became a constructive one  and people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud  tear up  and they consoled me during my own tough times. It's about knowing you're not alone  it's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways  it's about making space for reflection and contemplation  and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change. I made this last year  and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community. So  my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit  and now walls have been made in countries around the world  including Kazakhstan  South Africa  Australia  Argentina  and beyond. Together  we've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we're given the opportunity to have a voice  and share more with one another. Two of the most valuable things we have are time  and our relationships with other people. In our age of increasing distractions  it's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective  and remember that life is brief and tender. Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about  or even think about  but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do. Thinking about death clarifies your life. Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us  as individuals and as a community  and with more ways to share our hopes  fears and stories  the people around us can not only help us make better places  they can help us lead better lives. Thank you. Thank you. Everything I do  and everything I do professionally    my life    has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa. From      to         I look young  but I'm not    Laughter     I worked in Zambia  Kenya  Ivory Coast  Algeria  Somalia  in projects of technical cooperation with African countries. I worked for an Italian NGO  and every single project that we set up in Africa failed. And I was distraught. I thought  age     that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa. Instead  everything we touched we killed. Our first project  the one that has inspired my first book   Ripples from the Zambezi   was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food. So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River  and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ... And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that  so we paid them to come and work  and sometimes they would show up.  Laughter  And we were amazed that the local people  in such a fertile valley  would not have any agriculture. But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything  we simply said   Thank God we're here.   Laughter   Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation.  And of course  everything in Africa grew beautifully. We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy  a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia  to this size. And we could not believe  and we were telling the Zambians   Look how easy agriculture is.  When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red  overnight  some     hippos came out from the river and they ate everything.  Laughter  And we said to the Zambians   My God  the hippos   And the Zambians said   Yes  that's why we have no agriculture here.   Laughter   Why didn't you tell us   You never asked.  I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa  but then I saw what the Americans were doing  what the English were doing  what the French were doing  and after seeing what they were doing  I became quite proud of our project in Zambia. Because  you see  at least we fed the hippos. You should see the rubbish    Applause     You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people. You want to read the book  read  Dead Aid   by Dambisa Moyo  Zambian woman economist. The book was published in     . We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last    years. I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done. Just go and read her book. Read it from an African woman  the damage that we have done. We Western people are imperialist  colonialist missionaries  and there are only two ways we deal with people  We either patronize them  or we are paternalistic. The two words come from the Latin root  pater   which means  father.  But they mean two different things. Paternalistic  I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children.  I love you so much.  Patronizing  I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants. That's why the white people in Africa are called  bwana   boss. I was given a slap in the face reading a book   Small is Beautiful   written by Schumacher  who said  above all in economic development  if people do not wish to be helped  leave them alone. This should be the first principle of aid. The first principle of aid is respect. This morning  the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor  and said   Can we    can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial   I decided when I was    years old to only respond to people  and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation  where you never initiate anything  you never motivate anybody  but you become a servant of the local passion  the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person. So what you do    you shut up. You never arrive in a community with any ideas  and you sit with the local people. We don't work from offices. We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub. We have zero infrastructure. And what we do  we become friends  and we find out what that person wants to do. The most important thing is passion. You can give somebody an idea. If that person doesn't want to do it  what are you going to do  The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing. The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing. And then we help them to go and find the knowledge  because nobody in the world can succeed alone. The person with the idea may not have the knowledge  but the knowledge is available. So years and years ago  I had this idea  Why don't we  for once  instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do  why don't  for once  listen to them  But not in community meetings. Let me tell you a secret. There is a problem with community meetings. Entrepreneurs never come  and they never tell you  in a public meeting  what they want to do with their own money  what opportunity they have identified. So planning has this blind spot. The smartest people in your community you don't even know  because they don't come to your public meetings. What we do  we work one on one  and to work one on one  you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist. You have to create a new profession. The profession is the family doctor of enterprise  the family doctor of business  who sits with you in your house  at your kitchen table  at the cafe  and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living. I started this as a tryout in Esperance  in Western Australia. I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time  trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do. And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets  and in three days I had my first client  and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage  was a Maori guy  and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth  to get organized  and then the fishermen came to me to say   You the guy who helped Maori  Can you help us   And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for    cents a kilo  but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for    dollars a kilo  and the farmers came to talk to me  said   Hey  you helped them. Can you help us   In a year  I had    projects going on  and the government came to see me to say   How can you do that  How can you do      And I said   I do something very  very  very difficult. I shut up  and listen to them.   Laughter  So    Applause    So the government says   Do it again.   Laughter  We've done it in     communities around the world. We have helped to start        businesses. There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude. Peter Drucker  one of the greatest management consultants in history  died age     a few years ago. Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business  and this is what Peter Drucker says   Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy.  Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship. So now you're rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy. You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you. You have to offer them confidentiality  privacy  you have to be fantastic at helping them  and then they will come  and they will come in droves. In a community of        people  we get     clients. Can you imagine a community of         people  the intelligence and the passion  Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning  Local  passionate people. That's who you have applauded. So what I'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it's at. We are at the end of the first industrial revolution    nonrenewable fossil fuels  manufacturing    and all of a sudden  we have systems which are not sustainable. The internal combustion engine is not sustainable. Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable. What we have to look at is at how we feed  cure  educate  transport  communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way. The technologies do not exist to do that. Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution  Universities  Forget about it  Government  Forget about it  It will be entrepreneurs  and they're doing it now. There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many  many years ago. There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in     . And in       this group of people came together  and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in     years  and the conclusion was unanimous  The city of New York would not exist in     years. Why  Because they looked at the curve and said  if the population keeps growing at this rate  to move the population of New York around  they would have needed six million horses  and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with. They were already drowning in manure.  Laughter  So       they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York. So what happens  In    years' time  in the year       in the United States of America  there were       car manufacturing companies         . The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over  and there were tiny  tiny little factories in backwaters. Dearborn  Michigan. Henry Ford. However  there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs. First  you have to offer them confidentiality. Otherwise they don't come and talk to you. Then you have to offer them absolute  dedicated  passionate service to them. And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship. The smallest company  the biggest company  has to be capable of doing three things beautifully  The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic  you have to have fantastic marketing  and you have to have tremendous financial management. Guess what  We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it  sell it and look after the money. It doesn't exist. This person has never been born. We've done the research  and we have looked at the     iconic companies of the world    Carnegie  Westinghouse  Edison  Ford  all the new companies  Google  Yahoo. There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common  only one  None were started by one person. Now we teach entrepreneurship to    year olds in Northumberland  and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography  and the task of the    year olds is to underline  in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography how many times Richard uses the word  I  and how many times he uses the word  we.  Never the word  I   and the word  we     times. He wasn't alone when he started. Nobody started a company alone. No one. So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes  in bars  and your dedicated buddies who will do to you  what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic  somebody who will say to you   What do you need  What can you do  Can you make it  Okay  can you sell it  Can you look after the money    Oh  no  I cannot do this.  Would you like me to find you somebody   We activate communities. We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion  the energy and imagination of your own people. Thank you.  Applause  Hi. I'm here to talk about congestion  namely road congestion. Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon. It exists in basically all of the cities all around the world  which is a little bit surprising when you think about it. I mean  think about how different cities are  actually. I mean  you have the typical European cities  with a dense urban core  good public transportation mostly  not a lot of road capacity. But then  on the other hand  you have the American cities. It's moving by itself  okay. Anyway  the American cities  lots of roads dispersed over large areas  almost no public transportation. And then you have the emerging world cities  with a mixed variety of vehicles  mixed land use patterns  also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core. And traffic planners all around the world have tried lots of different measures  dense cities or dispersed cities  lots of roads or lots of public transport or lots of bike lanes or more information  or lots of different things  but nothing seems to work. But all of these attempts have one thing in common. They're basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving. They're essentially  to a point  attempts at planning what other people should do  planning their life for them. Now  planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do  and let me tell you a story. Back in       when the Berlin Wall fell  an urban planner in London got a phone call from a colleague in Moscow saying  basically   Hi  this is Vladimir. I'd like to know  who's in charge of London's bread supply   And the urban planner in London goes   What do you mean  who's in charge of London's   I mean  no one is in charge.   Oh  but surely someone must be in charge. I mean  it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this.   No. No. No one is in charge. I mean  it basically    I haven't really thought of it. It basically organizes itself.  It organizes itself. That's an example of a complex social system which has the ability of self organizing  and this is a very deep insight. When you try to solve really complex social problems  the right thing to do is most of the time to create the incentives. You don't plan the details  and people will figure out what to do  how to adapt to this new framework. And let's now look at how we can use this insight to combat road congestion. This is a map of Stockholm  my hometown. Now  Stockholm is a medium sized city  roughly two million people  but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges    narrow bridges  old bridges    which means lots of road congestion. And these red dots show the most congested parts  which are the bridges that lead into the inner city. And then someone came up with the idea that  apart from good public transport  apart from spending money on roads  let's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks. Now  one or two euros  that isn't really a lot of money  I mean compared to parking charges and running costs  etc.  so you would probably expect that car drivers wouldn't really react to this fairly small charge. You would be wrong. One or two euros was enough to make    percent of cars disappear from rush hours. Now     percent  well  that's a fairly huge figure  you might think  but you've still got    percent left of the problem  right  Because you still have    percent of the traffic. Now  that's also wrong  because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon  meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really  really rapidly. But fortunately  it also works the other way around. If you can reduce traffic even somewhat  then congestion will go down much faster than you might think. Now  congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm on January          and the first picture here is a picture of Stockholm  one of the typical streets  January  . The first day with the congestion charges looked like this. This is what happens when you take away    percent of the cars from the streets. You really reduce congestion quite substantially. But  well  as I said  I mean  car drivers adapt  right  So after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges. Wrong again. It's now six and a half years ago since the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm  and we basically have the same low traffic levels still. But you see  there's an interesting gap here in the time series in     . Well  the thing is that  the congestion charges  they were introduced first as a trial  so they were introduced in January and then abolished again at the end of July  followed by a referendum  and then they were reintroduced again in       which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity. I mean  this was a really fun experiment to start with  and we actually got to do it twice. And personally  I would like to do this every once a year or so  but they won't let me do that. But it was fun anyway. So  we followed up. What happened  This is the last day with the congestion charges  July     and you see the same street but now it's summer  and summer in Stockholm is a very nice and light time of the year  and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this. All the cars were back again  and you even have to admire the car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly. The first day they all came back. And this effect hanged on. So      figures looked like this. Now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know  but I would say that the most surprising slide here I'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one. This shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm  and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced in the beginning of Spring       people were fiercely against it. Seventy percent of the population didn't want this. But what happened when the congestion charges were there is not what you would expect  that people hated it more and more. No  on the contrary  they changed  up to a point where we now have    percent support for keeping the charges  meaning that    I mean  let me repeat that     percent of the population in Stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free. Okay. So why can that be  Why is that  Well  think about it this way. Who changed  I mean  the    percent of the car drivers that disappeared  surely they must be discontent in a way. And where did they go  If we can understand this  then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this. Well  so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services  and tried to figure out who changed  and where did they go  And it turned out that they don't know themselves.  Laughter  For some reason  the car drivers are    they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do. And why is that  It's because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think. Each day  people make new decisions  and people change and the world changes around them  and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people don't even notice. They're not even aware of this themselves. And the other question  who changed their mind  Who changed their opinion  and why  So we did another interview survey  tried to figure out why people changed their mind  and what type of group changed their minds  And after analyzing the answers  it turned out that more than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds. They're actually confident that they have liked congestion pricing all along. Which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with    percent  and reduced congestion by enormous numbers  and people aren't even aware that they have changed  and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along. This is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems  and when you do that  you shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt. You should just nudge them in the right direction. And if you do it right  people will actually embrace the change  and if you do it right  people will actually even like it. Thank you.  Applause  Life is about opportunities  creating them and embracing them  and for me  that was the Olympic dream. That's what defined me. That was my bliss. As a cross country skier and member of the Australian ski team  headed towards the Winter Olympics  I was on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates. As we made our way up towards the spectacular Blue Mountains west of Sydney  it was the perfect autumn day  sunshine  the smell of eucalypt and a dream. Life was good. We'd been on our bikes for around five and half hours when we got to the part of the ride that I loved  and that was the hills  because I loved the hills. And I got up off the seat of my bike  and I started pumping my legs  and as I sucked in the cold mountain air  I could feel it burning my lungs  and I looked up to see the sun shining in my face. And then everything went black. Where was I  What was happening  My body was consumed by pain. I'd been hit by a speeding utility truck with only    minutes to go on the bike ride. I was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in Sydney. I had extensive and life threatening injuries. I'd broken my neck and my back in six places. I broke five ribs on my left side. I broke my right arm. I broke my collarbone. I broke some bones in my feet. My whole right side was ripped open  filled with gravel. My head was cut open across the front  lifted back  exposing the skull underneath. I had head injures. I had internal injuries. I had massive blood loss. In fact  I lost about five liters of blood  which is all someone my size would actually hold. By the time the helicopter arrived at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney  my blood pressure was    over nothing. I was having a really bad day.  Laughter  For over    days  I drifted between two dimensions. I had an awareness of being in my body  but also being out of my body  somewhere else  watching from above as if it was happening to someone else. Why would I want to go back to a body that was so broken  But this voice kept calling me   Come on  stay with me.   No. It's too hard.   Come on. This is our opportunity.   No. That body is broken. It can no longer serve me.   Come on. Stay with me. We can do it. We can do it together.  I was at a crossroads. I knew if I didn't return to my body  I'd have to leave this world forever. It was the fight of my life. After    days  I made the decision to return to my body  and the internal bleeding stopped. The next concern was whether I would walk again  because I was paralyzed from the waist down. They said to my parents  the neck break was a stable fracture  but the back was completely crushed. The vertebra at L  was like you'd dropped a peanut  stepped on it  smashed it into thousands of pieces. They'd have to operate. They went in. They put me on a beanbag. They cut me  literally cut me in half  I have a scar that wraps around my entire body. They picked as much broken bone as they could that had lodged in my spinal cord. They took out two of my broken ribs  and they rebuilt my back  L   they rebuilt it  they took out another broken rib  they fused T    L  and L  together. Then they stitched me up. They took an entire hour to stitch me up. I woke up in intensive care  and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that stage I had a little bit of movement in one of my big toes  and I thought   Great  because I'm going to the Olympics   I had no idea. That's the sort of thing that happens to someone else  not me  surely. But then the doctor came over to me  and she said   Janine  the operation was a success  and we've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could  but the damage is permanent. The central nervous system nerves  there is no cure. You're what we call a partial paraplegic  and you'll have all of the injuries that go along with that. You have no feeling from the waist down  and at most  you might get     or    percent return. You'll have internal injuries for the rest of your life. You'll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life. And if you walk again  it will be with calipers and a walking frame.  And then she said   Janine  you'll have to rethink everything you do in your life  because you're never going to be able to do the things you did before.  I tried to grasp what she was saying. I was an athlete. That's all I knew. That's all I'd done. If I couldn't do that  then what could I do  And the question I asked myself is  if I couldn't do that  then who was I  They moved me from intensive care to acute spinal. I was lying on a thin  hard spinal bed. I had no movement in my legs. I had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots. I had one arm in plaster  one arm tied down by drips. I had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head and I saw my world through a mirror that was suspended above my head. I shared the ward with five other people  and the amazing thing is that because we were all lying paralyzed in a spinal ward  we didn't know what each other looked like. How amazing is that  How often in life do you get to make friendships  judgment free  purely based on spirit  And there were no superficial conversations as we shared our innermost thoughts  our fears  and our hopes for life after the spinal ward. I remember one night  one of the nurses came in  Jonathan  with a whole lot of plastic straws. He put a pile on top of each of us  and he said   Start threading them together.  Well  there wasn't much else to do in the spinal ward  so we did. And when we'd finished  he went around silently and he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward  and then he said   Okay  everybody  hold on to your straws.  And we did. And he said   Right. Now we're all connected.  And as we held on  and we breathed as one  we knew we weren't on this journey alone. And even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward  there were moments of incredible depth and richness  of authenticity and connection that I had never experienced before. And each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward we would never be the same. After six months  it was time to go home. I remember Dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair  wrapped in a plaster body cast  and feeling the sun on my face for the first time. I soaked it up and I thought  how could I ever have taken this for granted  I felt so incredibly grateful for my life. But before I left the hospital  the head nurse had said to me   Janine  I want you to be ready  because when you get home  something's going to happen.  And I said   What   And she said   You're going to get depressed.  And I said   Not me  not Janine the Machine   which was my nickname. She said   You are  because  see  it happens to everyone. In the spinal ward  that's normal. You're in a wheelchair. That's normal. But you're going to get home and realize how different life is.  And I got home and something happened. I realized Sister Sam was right. I did get depressed. I was in my wheelchair. I had no feeling from the waist down  attached to a catheter bottle. I couldn't walk. I'd lost so much weight in the hospital I now weighed about    pounds. And I wanted to give up. All I wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the door. I wanted my old life back. I wanted my body back. And I can remember Mom sitting on the end of my bed  and saying   I wonder if life will ever be good again.  And I thought   How could it  Because I've lost everything that I valued  everything that I'd worked towards. Gone.  And the question I asked was   Why me  Why me   And then I remembered my friends that were still in the spinal ward  particularly Maria. Maria was in a car accident  and she woke up on her   th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic  had no movement from the neck down  had damage to her vocal chords  and she couldn't talk. They told me   We're going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her.  I was worried. I didn't know how I'd react to being next to her. I knew it would be challenging  but it was actually a blessing  because Maria always smiled. She was always happy  and even when she began to talk again  albeit difficult to understand  she never complained  not once. And I wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance. And I realized that this wasn't just my life. It was life itself. I realized that this wasn't just my pain. It was everybody's pain. And then I knew  just like before  that I had a choice. I could keep fighting this or I could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life. And then I stopped asking   Why me   And I started to ask   Why not me   And then I thought to myself  maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start. I had never before thought of myself as a creative person. I was an athlete. My body was a machine. But now I was about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do  that of rebuilding a life. And even though I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do  in that uncertainty came a sense of freedom. I was no longer tied to a set path. I was free to explore life's infinite possibilities. And that realization was about to change my life. Sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast  an airplane flew overhead  and I looked up  and I thought to myself   That's it  If I can't walk  then I might as well fly.  I said   Mom  I'm going to learn how to fly.  She said   That's nice  dear.   Laughter  I said   Pass me the yellow pages.  She passed me the phone book  I rang up the flying school  I made a booking  said I'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight. They said   You know  when do you want to come out   I said   Well  I have to get a friend to drive me out because I can't drive. Sort of can't walk either. Is that a problem   I made a booking  and weeks later my friend Chris and my mom drove me out to the airport  all    pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls.  Laughter  I can tell you  I did not look like the ideal candidate to get a pilot's license.  Laughter  I'm holding on to the counter because I can't stand. I said   Hi  I'm here for a flying lesson.  And they took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws.  You get her.  No  no  you take her.  Finally this guy comes out. He goes   Hi  I'm Andrew  and I'm going to take you flying.  I go   Great.  And so they drive me down  they get me out on the tarmac  and there was this red  white and blue airplane. It was beautiful. They lifted me into the cockpit. They had to slide me up on the wing  put me in the cockpit. They sat me down. There are buttons and dials everywhere. I'm going   Wow  how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do   Andrew the instructor got in the front  started the airplane up. He said   Would you like to have a go at taxiing   That's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground. I said   No  I can't use my legs.  He went   Oh.  I said   But I can use my hands   and he said   Okay.  So he got over to the runway  and he applied the power. And as we took off down the runway  and the wheels lifted up off the tarmac  and we became airborne  I had the most incredible sense of freedom. And Andrew said to me  as we got over the training area   You see that mountain over there   And I said   Yeah.  And he said   Well  you take the controls  and you fly towards that mountain.  And as I looked up  I realized that he was pointing towards the Blue Mountains where the journey had begun. And I took the controls  and I was flying. And I was a long  long way from that spinal ward  and I knew right then that I was going to be a pilot. Didn't know how on Earth I'd ever pass a medical. But I'd worry about that later  because right now I had a dream. So I went home  I got a training diary out  and I had a plan. And I practiced my walking as much as I could  and I went from the point of two people holding me up to one person holding me up to the point where I could walk around the furniture as long as it wasn't too far apart. And then I made great progression to the point where I could walk around the house  holding onto the walls  like this  and Mom said she was forever following me  wiping off my fingerprints.  Laughter  But at least she always knew where I was. So while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again  I went on with my theory study  and then eventually  and amazingly  I passed my pilot's medical  and that was my green light to fly. And I spent every moment I could out at that flying school  way out of my comfort zone  all these young guys that wanted to be Qantas pilots  you know  and little old hop along me in first my plaster cast  and then my steel brace  my baggy overalls  my bag of medication and catheters and my limp  and they used to look at me and think   Oh  who is she kidding  She's never going to be able to do this.  And sometimes I thought that too. But that didn't matter  because now there was something inside that burned that far outweighed my injuries. And little goals kept me going along the way  and eventually I got my private pilot's license  and then I learned to navigate  and I flew my friends around Australia. And then I learned to fly an airplane with two engines and I got my twin engine rating. And then I learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather and got my instrument rating. And then I got my commercial pilot's license. And then I got my instructor rating. And then I found myself back at that same school where I'd gone for that very first flight  teaching other people how to fly  just under    months after I'd left the spinal ward. And then I thought   Why stop there  Why not learn to fly upside down   And I did  and I learned to fly upside down and became an aerobatics flying instructor. And Mom and Dad  Never been up. But then I knew for certain that although my body might be limited  it was my spirit that was unstoppable. The philosopher Lao Tzu once said   When you let go of what you are  you become what you might be.  I now know that it wasn't until I let go of who I thought I was that I was able to create a completely new life. It wasn't until I let go of the life I thought I should have that I was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me. I now know that my real strength never came from my body  and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically  who I am is unchanged. The pilot light inside of me was still a light  just as it is in each and every one of us. I know that I'm not my body  and I also know that you're not yours. And then it no longer matters what you look like  where you come from  or what you do for a living. All that matters is that we continue to fan the flame of humanity by living our lives as the ultimate creative expression of who we really are  because we are all connected by millions and millions of straws  and it's time to join those up and to hang on. And if we are to move towards our collective bliss  it's time we shed our focus on the physical and instead embrace the virtues of the heart. So raise your straws if you'll join me. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals. There are        species of birds in the world. Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds. When you see a vulture like this  the first thing that comes to your mind is  these are disgusting  ugly  greedy creatures that are just after your flesh  associated with politicians.  Laughter   Applause  I want to change that perception. I want to change those feelings you have for these birds  because they need our sympathy. They really do.  Laughter  And I'll tell you why. First of all  why do they have such a bad press  When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in      on the Beagle  he saw the turkey vulture  and he said   These are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity.   Laughter  You could not get a worse insult  and that from Charles Darwin.  Laughter  You know  he changed his mind when he came back  and I'll tell you why. They've also be associated with Disney    Laughter    personified as goofy  dumb  stupid characters. More recently  if you've been following the Kenyan press    Laughter   Applause   Cheers    these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that. I want to challenge that. Do you know why  Because MPs do not keep the environment clean.  Laughter  MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases. They are hardly monogamous.  Laughter   Applause  They are far from being extinct.  Laughter  And  my favorite is  vultures are better looking.  Applause   Laughter  So there's two types of vultures in this planet. There are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas  like the condors and the caracaras  and then the Old World vultures  where we have    species. From these        of them are facing a high risk of extinction. So why are vultures important  First of all  they provide vital ecological services. They clean up. They're our natural garbage collectors. They clean up carcasses right to the bone. They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals. Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures  carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose  and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases. Vultures also have tremendous historical significance. They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture. Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood  and together with the cobra  symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt. In Hindu mythology  Jatayu was the vulture god  and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita from the    headed demon Ravana. In Tibetan culture  they are performing very important sky burials. In places like Tibet  there are no places to bury the dead  or wood to cremate them  so these vultures provide a natural disposal system. So what is the problem with vultures  We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya  of which six are highly threatened with extinction. The reason is that they're getting poisoned  and the reason that they're getting poisoned is because there's human wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators  and in return  the vultures are falling victim to this. In South Asia  in countries like India and Pakistan  four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered  which means they have less than    or    years to go extinct  and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac. This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India  and they have taken a stand. Because there are no vultures  there's been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites  and when you have feral dogs  you have a huge time bomb of rabies. The number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India. Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa      wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana. I am not against wind energy  but we need to work with the governments  because wind turbines do this to birds. They slice them in half. They are bird blending machines. In West Africa  there's a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market. So what's being done  Well  we're conducting research on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them. We're trying to determine their basic ecology  and see where they go. We can see that they travel different countries  so if you focus on a problem locally  it's not going to help you. We need to work with governments in regional levels. We're working with local communities. We're talking to them about appreciating vultures  about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide. How can you help  You can become active  make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time to spread the word. Spread the word. When you walk out of this room  you will be informed about vultures  but speak to your families  to your children  to your neighbors about vultures. They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies. Kenya  this world  will be much poorer without these wonderful species. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'm going to talk about the power of a word  jihad. To the vast majority of practicing Muslims  jihad is an internal struggle for the faith. It is a struggle within  a struggle against vice  sin  temptation  lust  greed. It is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran. In that original idea  the concept of jihad is as important to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians. It's a very powerful word  jihad  if you look at it in that respect  and there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it. And that's the reason why  for hundreds of years  Muslims everywhere have named their children Jihad  their daughters as much as their sons  in the same way that  say  Christians name their daughters Grace  and Hindus  my people  name our daughters Bhakti  which means  in Sanskrit  spiritual worship. But there have always been  in Islam  a small group  a minority  who believe that jihad is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle against forces that would threaten the faith  or the faithul. And some of these people believe that in that struggle  it is sometimes okay to take up arms. And so the thousands of young Muslim men who flocked to Afghanistan in the     s to fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country  in their minds they were fighting a jihad  they were doing jihad  and they named themselves the Mujahideen  which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad. And we forget this now  but back then the Mujahideen were celebrated in this country  in America. We thought of them as holy warriors who were taking the good fight to the ungodly communists. America gave them weapons  gave them money  gave them support  encouragement. But within that group  a tiny  smaller group  a minority within a minority within a minority  were coming up with a new and dangerous conception of jihad  and in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden  and he refined the idea. His idea of jihad was a global war of terror  primarily targeted at the far enemy  at the crusaders from the West  against America. And the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad were so horrendous  so monstrous  and had such great impact  that his definition was the one that stuck  not just here in the West. We didn't know any better. We didn't pause to ask. We just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers were calling what they did jihad  then that's what jihad must mean. But it wasn't just us. Even in the Muslim world  his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance. A year ago I was in Tunis  and I met the imam of a very small mosque  an old man. Fifteen years ago  he named his granddaughter Jihad  after the old meaning. He hoped that a name like that would inspire her to live a spiritual life. But he told me that after       he began to have second thoughts. He worried that if he called her by that name  especially outdoors  outside in public  he might be seen as endorsing bin Laden's idea of jihad. On Fridays in his mosque  he gave sermons trying to reclaim the meaning of the word  but his congregants  the people who came to his mosque  they had seen the videos. They had seen pictures of the planes going into the towers  the towers coming down. They had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad  and claimed victory for it. And so the old imam worried that his words were falling on deaf ears. No one was paying attention. He was wrong. Some people were paying attention  but for the wrong reasons. The United States  at this point  was putting pressure on all its Arab allies  including Tunisia  to stamp out extremism in their societies  and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs of the Tunisian intelligence service. They had never paid him any attention before    old man  small mosque    but now they began to pay visits  and sometimes they would drag him in for questions  and always the same question   Why did you name your granddaughter Jihad  Why do you keep using the word jihad in your Friday sermons  Do you hate Americans  What is your connection to Osama bin Laden   So to the Tunisian intelligence agency  and organizations like it all over the Arab world  jihad equaled extremism  Bin Laden's definition had become institutionalized. That was the power of that word that he was able to do. And it filled this old imam  it filled him with great sadness. He told me that  of bin Laden's many crimes  this was  in his mind  one that didn't get enough attention  that he took this word  this beautiful idea. He didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it and debased it and corrupted it and turned it into something it was never meant to be  and then persuaded all of us that it always was a global jihad. But the good news is that the global jihad is almost over  as bin Laden defined it. It was dying well before he did  and now it's on its last legs. Opinion polls from all over the Muslim world show that there is very little interest among Muslims in a global holy war against the West  against the far enemy. The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling. The supply of money   just as important  more important perhaps   the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling. The wealthy fanatics who were previously sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous. What does that mean for us in the West  Does it mean we can break out the champagne  wash our hands of it  disengage  sleep easy at night  No. Disengagement is not an option  because if you let local jihad survive  it becomes international jihad. And so there's now a lot of different violent jihads all over the world. In Somalia  in Mali  in Nigeria  in Iraq  in Afghanistan  Pakistan  there are groups that claim to be the inheritors of the legacy of Osama bin Laden. They use his rhetoric. They even use the brand name he created for his jihad. So there is now an al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb  there's an al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula  there is an al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. There are other groups    in Nigeria  Boko Haram  in Somalia  al Shabaab    and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden. But if you look closely  they're not fighting a global jihad. They're fighting battles over much narrower issues. Usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism  or it's a power struggle. More often than not  it's a power struggle in one country  or even a small region within one country. Occasionally they will go across a border  from Iraq to Syria  from Mali to Algeria  from Somalia to Kenya  but they're not fighting a global jihad against some far enemy. But that doesn't mean that we can relax. I was in Yemen recently  where    it's the home of the last al Qaeda franchise that still aspires to attack America  attack the West. It's old school al Qaeda. You may remember these guys. They are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here  and they were using the Internet to try and instigate violence among American Muslims. But they have been distracted recently. Last year  they took control over a portion of southern Yemen  and ran it  Taliban style. And then the Yemeni military got its act together  and ordinary people rose up against these guys and drove them out  and since then  most of their activities  most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis. So I think we've come to a point now where we can say that  just like all politics  all jihad is local. But that's still not reason for us to disengage  because we've seen that movie before  in Afghanistan. When those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union  we disengaged. And even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne  the Taliban had taken over in Kabul  and we said   Local jihad  not our problem.  And then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar to Osama bin Laden. He made it our problem. Local jihad  if you ignore it  becomes global jihad again. The good news is that it doesn't have to be. We know how to fight it now. We have the tools. We have the knowhow  and we can take the lessons we've learned from the fight against global jihad  the victory against global jihad  and apply those to local jihad. What are those lessons  We know who killed bin Laden  SEAL Team Six. Do we know  do we understand  who killed bin Ladenism  Who ended the global jihad  There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad. Who killed bin Ladenism  Let's start with bin Laden himself. He probably thought      was his greatest achievement. In reality  it was the beginning of the end for him. He killed       innocent people  and that filled the Muslim world with horror and revulsion  and what that meant was that his idea of jihad could never become mainstream. He condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes of his own community.      didn't empower him  it doomed him. Who killed bin Ladenism  Abu Musab al Zarqawi killed it. He was the especially sadistic head of al Qaeda in Iraq who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack not Americans but Iraqis. Muslims. Sunni as well as Shiites. Any claim that al Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam against the Western crusaders was drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims. Who killed Osama bin Laden  The SEAL Team Six. Who killed bin Ladenism  Al Jazeera did  Al Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic  because they circumvented the old  state owned television stations in a lot of these countries which were designed to keep information from people. Al Jazeera brought information to them  showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion  exposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda  and allowed them  gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions. Who killed bin Ladenism  The Arab Spring did  because it showed a way for young Muslims to bring about change in a manner that Osama bin Laden  with his limited imagination  could never have conceived. Who defeated the global jihad  The American military did  the American soldiers did  with their allies  fighting in faraway battlefields. And perhaps  a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it. So all these factors  and many more besides  we don't even fully understand some of them yet  these came together to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin Ladenism  the global jihad  you needed this group effort. Now  not all of these things will work in local jihad. The American military is not going to march into Nigeria to take on Boko Haram  and it's unlikely that SEAL Team Six will rappel into the homes of al Shabaab's leaders and take them out. But many of these other factors that were in play are now even stronger than before. Half the work is already done. We don't have to reinvent the wheel. The notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited. We don't have to go back to that. Satellite television and the Internet are informing and empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways. And the Arab Spring has produced governments  many of them Islamist governments  who know that  for their own self preservation  they need to take on the extremists in their midsts. We don't need to persuade them  but we do need to help them  because they haven't really come to this place before. The good news  again  is that a lot of the things they need we already have  and we are very good at giving  economic assistance  not just money  but expertise  technology  knowhow  private investment  fair terms of trade  medicine  education  technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective  for their anti terror forces to become more efficient. We've got plenty of these things. Some of the other things that they need we're not very good at giving. Maybe nobody is. Time  patience  subtlety  understanding    these are harder to give. I live in New York now. Just this week  posters have gone up in subway stations in New York that describe jihad as savage. But in all the many years that I have covered the Middle East  I have never been as optimistic as I am today that the gap between the Muslim world and the West is narrowing fast  and one of the many reasons for my optimism is that  because I know there are millions  hundreds of millions of people  Muslims like that old imam in Tunis  who are reclaiming this word and restoring to its original  beautiful purpose. Bin Laden is dead. Bin Ladenism has been defeated. His definition of jihad can now be expunged. To that jihad we can say   Goodbye. Good riddance.  To the real jihad we can say   Welcome back. Good luck.  Thank you.  Applause  So I grew up in Limpopo  on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga  a little town called Motetema. Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather  and growing up in these tough situations  at the age of     I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter  and we were sunbathing. The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter. So as we were sunbathing  my best friend next to me says   Man  why doesn't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe   And I sat  and I was like   Man  I would buy that  eh   So I went home  and I did a little research  and I found some very shocking statistics. Over  .  billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation. Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa  and five million of them are in South Africa. Various diseases thrive in this environment  the most drastic of which is called trachoma. Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind. The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year. The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma  all you have to do is wash your face  no medicine  no pills  no injections. So after seeing these shocking statistics  I thought to myself   Okay  even if I'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don't want to bathe  I at least need to do it to try to save the world.   Laughter  So with my trusty little steed  my Nokia      cell phone    I didn't have a laptop  I didn't have Internet much  except for the    rand an hour Internet cafe   I did research on Wikipedia  on Google  about lotions  creams  the compositions  the melting points  the toxicities    I did high school science    and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper  and it looked like the KFC special spice  you know  So I was like  okay  so we've got the formula ready. Now we need to get this thing into practice. Fast forward four years later  after having written a    page business plan on the cell phone  having written my patent on the cell phone  I'm the youngest patent holder in the country  and     No more bathing      I can't say any more than that.  Laughter  I had invented DryBath  the world's first bath substituting lotion. You literally put it on your skin  and you don't have to bathe. So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had  I went to university  met a few people  got it into practice  and we have a fully functioning product that's ready to go to the market. It's actually available on the market. So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available. One of the things we learned was that poor communities don't buy products in bulk. They buy products on demand. A person in Alex doesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette each day  even though it's more expensive. So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets. You just snap them in half  and you squeeze it out. And the cool part is  one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand. After creating that model  we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product. We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath.  Laughter  At least once a week. Anyway  we realized that we could save    million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath  and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas  two hours more for school  two hours more for homework  two hours more to just be a kid. After seeing that global impact  we narrowed it down to our key value proposition  which was cleanliness and convenience. DryBath is a rich man's convenience and a poor man's lifesaver. Having put the product into practice  we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market  and one question I have for the audience today is  on the gravel roads of Limpopo  with an allowance of    rand a week  I came up with a way for the world not to bathe. What's stopping you   Applause  I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet. And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process  last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world. I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world  the first African to get that accolade  and one thing that really puzzles me is  I did all of this just because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you. B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future. He had a vision. When he got out  he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight  and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision. He'd spent        dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.  Laughter  It was my first week in federal prison  and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV. In fact  it was teeming with smart  ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate. Now     percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside  but when they talked about what they did  they talked about it in a different jargon  but the business concepts that they talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton  promotional incentives  you never charge a first time user  focus grouping new product launches  territorial expansion. But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days. For the most part  everyone was just trying to survive. It's a lot harder than you might think. Contrary to what most people think  people don't pay  taxpayers don't pay  for your life when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life. You've got to pay for your soap  your deodorant  toothbrush  toothpaste  all of it. And it's hard for a couple of reasons. First  everything's marked up    to    percent from what you'd pay on the street  and second  you don't make a lot of money. I unloaded trucks. That was my full time job  unloading trucks at a food warehouse  for   .    not an hour  but per month. So how do you survive  Well  you learn to hustle  all kinds of hustles. There's legal hustles. You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency. You charge another inmate to clean his cell. There's sort of illegal hustles  like you run a barbershop out of your cell. There's pretty illegal hustles  You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell. And there's very illegal hustles  which you smuggle in  you get smuggled in  drugs  pornography  cell phones  and just as in the outer world  there's a risk reward tradeoff  so the riskier the enterprise  the more profitable it can potentially be. You want a cigarette in prison  Three to five dollars. You want an old fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head  Three hundred bucks. You want a dirty magazine  Well  it can be as much as       dollars. So as you can probably tell  one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity. Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse  sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers  or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs  prisoners learn how to make do with less  and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they've learned to the outside and start restaurants  barber shops  personal training businesses. But there's no training  nothing to prepare them for that  no rehabilitation at all in prison  no one to help them write a business plan  figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises  no access to the Internet  even. And then  when they come out  most states don't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background. So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex offenders re offend within five years. Look  I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it. But when I came out  I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had. So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way. The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons  because if we don't  they're not going to learn any new skills that's going to help them  and they'll be right back. All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles. Thank you.  Applause  I'd like to show you a video of some of the models I work with. They're all the perfect size  and they don't have an ounce of fat. Did I mention they're gorgeous  And they're scientific models   Laughs  As you might have guessed  I'm a tissue engineer  and this is a video of some of the beating heart that I've engineered in the lab. And one day we hope that these tissues can serve as replacement parts for the human body. But what I'm going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models. Well  let's think about the drug screening process for a moment. You go from drug formulation  lab testing  animal testing  and then clinical trials  which you might call human testing  before the drugs get to market. It costs a lot of money  a lot of time  and sometimes  even when a drug hits the market  it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people. And the later it fails  the worse the consequences. It all boils down to two issues. One  humans are not rats  and two  despite our incredible similarities to one another  actually those tiny differences between you and I have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs and how those drugs affect us. So what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats but also reflect our diversity  Let's see how we can do it with tissue engineering. One of the key technologies that's really important is what's called induced pluripotent stem cells. They were developed in Japan pretty recently. Okay  induced pluripotent stem cells. They're a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy. We induce cells  okay  say  skin cells  by adding a few genes to them  culturing them  and then harvesting them. So they're skin cells that can be tricked  kind of like cellular amnesia  into an embryonic state. So without the controversy  that's cool thing number one. Cool thing number two  you can grow any type of tissue out of them  brain  heart  liver  you get the picture  but out of your cells. So we can make a model of your heart  your brain on a chip. Generating tissues of predictable density and behavior is the second piece  and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery. And this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab to help engineer tissues in a more modular  scalable way. Going forward  imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue. It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip. But another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells is that if we take some skin cells  let's say  from people with a genetic disease and we engineer tissues out of them  we can actually use tissue engineering techniques to generate models of those diseases in the lab. Here's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard. He generated neurons from these induced pluripotent stem cells from patients who have Lou Gehrig's Disease  and he differentiated them into neurons  and what's amazing is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease. So with disease models like these  we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before  and maybe discover drugs even faster. This is another example of patient specific stem cells that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa. This is a degeneration of the retina. It's a disease that runs in my family  and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure. So some people think that these models sound well and good  but ask   Well  are these really as good as the rat   The rat is an entire organism  after all  with interacting networks of organs. A drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver  and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat. Don't you miss all that with these tissue engineered models  Well  this is another trend in the field. By combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics  the field is actually evolving towards just that  a model of the entire ecosystem of the body  complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart. These systems are really hard to build  but we're just starting to be able to get there  and so  watch out. But that's not even all of it  because once a drug is approved  tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments. This is an example that you might care about someday  and I hope you never do  because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer. Wouldn't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs you're going to take are going to work on your cancer  This is an example from Karen Burg's lab  where they're using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells and study its progressions and treatments. And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models like these with tissue engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next  and you can imagine those kinds of multi tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies. And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed  you can see  going forward  that tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path  disease models making for better drug formulations  massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing  reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials  and individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all. Essentially  we're dramatically speeding up that feedback between developing a molecule and learning about how it acts in the human body. Our process for doing this is essentially transforming biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology  helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster  more cheaply and more effectively. It gives new meaning to models against animal testing  doesn't it  Thank you.  Applause   My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax. My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back. I'm stylin'  smilin'  lookin' real mean  because it ain't about being heard  just being seen. My leather Adidas baseball cap matches my fake Gucci backpack.  Laughter  Ain't nobody who looks as good as me  but this costs money  it sure ain't free  and I gots no job  no money at all  but it's easy to steal all this from the mall. Parents say I shouldn't  but I knows I should. Got to do what I can to make sure I look good  and the reason I have to look real good  well  to tell you the truth  man  I don't know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside. When I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide  and I really must get some new gear soon or my ego will pop like a    cent balloon. But security is tight at all the shops. Every day there are more and more cops. My crew is laughing at me because I'm wearing old gear. School's almost over. Summer is near. And I'm sportin' torn Jordans. I need something new. Only one thing left to do. Cut school Friday  catch the subway downtown  check out my victims hangin' around. Maybe I'll get lucky and find easy prey. Got to get some new gear. There's no other way. I'm ready and willing. I'm packing my gun. This is serious business. This ain't no fun. And I can't have my posse laughin' at me. I'mma cop something dope  just wait  you'll see. Come out of the station  West  th near the park  brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks  'Hey homes  where you get them Nik's ' I says to myself  'Yeah. I likes 'em  I likes.' They were Q tip white  bright and blinding my eyes. The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly. Not one spot of dirt. The Airs were brand new. Had my pistol and knew just what to do. Waited until it was just the right time  followed him very closely behind. He made a left turn on Houston  I pulled out my gun  and I said  'Gimme them Jordans ' And the punk tried to run. Took off fast  didn't get far. I fired 'Pow ' Fool fell between two parked cars. He was coughing  crying  blood spilled on the street. And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet. While laying there dying  all he could say was   Please man  don't take my Air Jordans away.  You'd think he'd be worried about staying alive. As I took off with his sneakers  there was tears in his eyes. Very next day  I bopped into school with my brand new Air Jordans  man  I was cool. I killed to get 'em  but hey  I don't care  because now I needs a new jacket to wear.  Thank you.  Applause  For the last    years that I have been performing  all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world. See  it wasn't enough for me to write a book. It wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition  and while those things hold weight  it wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad. The hunger and thirst was  and still remains  How do I get people who hate poetry to love me  Because I'm an extension of my work  and if they love me  then they will love my work  and if they love my work  then they will love poetry  and if they love poetry  then I will have done my job  which is to transcend it to the world. And in       I found the answer in principles in a master spoken word artist named Reg E. Gaines  who wrote the famous poem   Please Don't Take My Air Jordans.  And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room  and I read him one of my pieces  and you know what he told me   Yo' wack. You know what the problem is with you  homie  You don't read other people's poetry  and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration.   Laughter  Now he kept on rambling about poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights. Now I could have quit. I should have quit. I mean  I thought poetry was just self expression. I didn't know you actually have to have creative control. So instead of quitting  I followed him everywhere. When he was writing a Broadway show  I would be outside of the door. I would wake him up at  like       in the morning to ask him who's the best poet. I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea because he told me it was brain food. Then one day I told him   Reg E.  what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration    Laughter  And he handed me a black and white printed out thesis on a poet named Etheridge Knight and the oral nature of poetry  and from that point  Reggie stopped becoming the best to me  because what Etheridge Knight taught me was that I could make my words sound like music  even my small ones  the monosyllables  the ifs  ands  buts  whats  the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear  and from then on  I started chasing Etheridge Knight. I wanted to know which poet he read  and I landed on a poem called   Dark Prophecy  Sing of Shine    a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be  Broadway  baby. And from that point  I learned how to pull the mic away and attack the poetry with my body. But that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned. The biggest lesson I learned was many years later when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent who looked at me up and down and said I don't look like I have any experience to be working in this business. And I said to him   Listen  punk fool  you're a failed actor who became an agent  and you know why you failed as an actor  Because people like me took your job. I've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex in East New York  took the local   line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point who were in my way on my way to master the art of space  and the one to infinite amount of man  woman and child you can fit in there only so I can push them to the back of the wall with my experience. People have bought tickets to my experience and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know that the revolution is near  so stock up. I'm so experienced that when you went to a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet  I was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me. I can master shock of  The Crying Game  with the awe of a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn't know that it was his father who gave it to my mother  and that's a double entendre. I'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child in it  that was me  but kicked me out when I was caught teaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans and bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off. Sanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself   Something's always wrong when nothing's always right.  Method acting is nothing but a mixture of multiple personalities  believing your own lies are reality  like in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop. Dude  you go to Riker's Island Academy. I could make David Mamet psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue  Stanislavski be as if he were Bruce Lee kicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw. So what  your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep  Let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon kung fu secret. Boards don't hit back. You think black entertainers have it hard finding work in this business  I'm a suspicious mulatto  which means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right. Forget the American ghetto. I've cracked stages in Soweto  buried abortion babies in potter's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face  so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack go for this  go for that assistant when I walk out that door  whatever slander you send my way  your mother. Thank you.  Applause  In       a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane. The Wright Brothers  in the beginning of the last century  had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly. They also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane. They were not the only ones. That was common practice in the industry  and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right. This actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry  and this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government was interested in ramping up the production of military airplanes. So there was a bit of a conflict there. The U.S. government decided to take action  and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of airplanes. So what has this got to do with this  In       Nelson Otwoma  a Kenyan social scientist  discovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment. He was told that a cure did not exist. AIDS  he heard  was lethal  and treatment was not offered. This was at a time that treatment actually existed in rich countries. AIDS had become a chronic disease. People in our countries here in Europe  in North America  were living with HIV  healthy lives. Not so for Nelson. He wasn't rich enough  and not so for his three year old son  who he discovered a year later also had HIV. Nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups. In       they were facing a different battle. Prices for ARVs  the drugs needed to treat HIV  cost about         dollars  per patient per year. The patents on those drugs were held by a number of Western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available. When you have a patent  you can exclude anyone else from making  from producing or making low cost versions  for example  available of those medications. Clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe. Luckily  those patents did not exist everywhere. There were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patents  such as India  and Indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so called generic versions  low cost copies of antiretroviral medicines  and make them available in the developing world  and within a year the price had come down from        dollars per patient per year to     dollars per patient per year  and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for    dollars per patient per year  and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines. Treatment programs became possible  funding became available  and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly. Today  eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs. Thirty four million are infected with HIV. Never has this number been so high  but actually this is good news  because what it means is people stop dying. People who have access to these drugs stop dying. And there's something else. They also stop passing on the virus. This is fairly recent science that has shown that. What that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic. So what's the problem  Well  things have changed. First of all  the rules have changed. Today  all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least    years. This is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the World Trade Organization. So what India did is no longer possible. Second  the practice of patent holding companies have changed. Here you see the patent practices before the World Trade Organization's rules  before '    before antiretroviral drugs. This is what you see today  and this is in developing countries  so what that means is  unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now  we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis  because new drugs are developed  new drugs go to market  but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries. So unless we act  unless we do something today  we will soon be faced  with  what some have termed the treatment time bomb. It isn't only the number of drugs that are patented. There's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away. This shows you a patent landscape. This is the landscape of one medicine. So you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product  unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available  you will probably choose to do something else. Again  deliberate action is needed. So surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes  we should be able to do something similar to tackle the HIV AIDS epidemic. And we did. In       UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool for HIV. And this is how it works  Patent holders  inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions  but make those patents available to the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents. That can be generic manufacturers. It can also be not for profit drug development agencies  for example. Those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower cost to people who need access to them  to treatment programs that need access to them. They pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders  so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property. There is one key difference with the airplane patent pool. The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism. The airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they'd license their patents or not. They were forced to do so. That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do. It relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others to use. Today  Nelson Otwoma is healthy. He has access to antiretroviral drugs. His son will soon be    years old. Nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the Medicines Patent Pool  and he told me not so long ago   Ellen  we rely in Kenya and in many other countries on the Medicines Patent Pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us  that new medicines  without delay  become available to us.  And this is no longer fantasy. Already  I'll give you an example. In August of this year  the United States drug agency approved a new four in one AIDS medication. The company  Gilead  that holds the patents  has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool. The pool is already working today  two months later  with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed. This is unprecedented. This has never been done before. The rule is about a    year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries  if at all. This has never been seen before. Nelson's expectations are very high  and quite rightly so. He and his son will need access to the next generation of antiretrovirals and the next  throughout their lifetime  so that he and many others in Kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy  active lives. Now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen. We count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest  not only in the interest of the global good  but also in their own interest  to move from conflict to collaboration  and through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen. They can also choose not to do that  but those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up with early last century  facing forcible measures by government. So they'd better jump now. Thank you.  Applause  I've been a journalist now since I was about     and it's an interesting industry to be in at the moment  because as you all know  there's a huge amount of upheaval going on in media  and most of you probably know this from the business angle  which is that the business model is pretty screwed  and as my grandfather would say  the profits have all been gobbled up by Google. So it's a really interesting time to be a journalist  but the upheaval that I'm interested in is not on the output side. It's on the input side. It's concern with how we get information and how we gather the news. And that's changed  because we've had a huge shift in the balance of power from the news organizations to the audience. And the audience for such a long time was in a position where they didn't have any way of affecting news or making any change. They couldn't really connect. And that's changed irrevocably. My first connection with the news media was in       the BBC had a one day strike. I wasn't happy. I was angry. I couldn't see my cartoons. So I wrote a letter. And it's a very effective way of ending your hate mail   Love Markham  Aged  .  Still works. I'm not sure if I had any impact on the one day strike  but what I do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me. And that was the round journey. It took that long for anyone to have any impact and get some feedback. And that's changed now because  as journalists  we interact in real time. We're not in a position where the audience is reacting to news. We're reacting to the audience  and we're actually relying on them. They're helping us find the news. They're helping us figure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear. So it's a real time thing. It's much quicker. It's happening on a constant basis  and the journalist is always playing catch up. To give an example of how we rely on the audience  on the  th of September in Costa Rica  an earthquake hit. It was a  .  magnitude. It was fairly big. And    seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel     kilometers to Managua. So the ground shook in Managua    seconds after it hit the epicenter. Thirty seconds later  the first message went onto Twitter  and this was someone saying  temblor   which means earthquake. So    seconds was how long it took for the physical earthquake to travel. Thirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveled all around the world  instantly. Everyone in the world  hypothetically  had the potential to know that an earthquake was happening in Managua. And that happened because this one person had a documentary instinct  which was to post a status update  which is what we all do now  so if something happens  we put our status update  or we post a photo  we post a video  and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream. And what that means is just constant  huge volumes of data going up. It's actually staggering. When you look at the numbers  every minute there are    more hours of video on YouTube. So that's  every second  more than an hour of video gets uploaded. And in photos  Instagram     photos are uploaded to Instagram a second. More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook. So by the time I'm finished talking here  there'll be     more hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started  and two and a half million more photos on Facebook and Instagram than when I started. So it's an interesting position to be in as a journalist  because we should have access to everything. Any event that happens anywhere in the world  I should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously  as it happens  for free. And that goes for every single person in this room. The only problem is  when you have that much information  you have to find the good stuff  and that can be incredibly difficult when you're dealing with those volumes. And nowhere was this brought home more than during Hurricane Sandy. So what you had in Hurricane Sandy was a superstorm  the likes of which we hadn't seen for a long time  hitting the iPhone capital of the universe     Laughter     and you got volumes of media like we'd never seen before. And that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes  so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted. We had to deal with composite images that were merging photos from previous storms. We had to deal with images from films like  The Day After Tomorrow.   Laughter  And we had to deal with images that were so realistic it was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all. But joking aside  there were images like this one from Instagram which was subjected to a grilling by journalists. They weren't really sure. It was filtered in Instagram. The lighting was questioned. Everything was questioned about it. And it turned out to be true. It was from Avenue C in downtown Manhattan  which was flooded. And the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source  and in this case  these guys were New York food bloggers. They were well respected. They were known. So this one wasn't a debunk  it was actually something that they could prove. And that was the job of the journalist. It was filtering all this stuff. And you were  instead of going and finding the information and bringing it back to the reader  you were holding back the stuff that was potentially damaging. And finding the source becomes more and more important    finding the good source    and Twitter is where most journalists now go. It's like the de facto real time newswire  if you know how to use it  because there is so much on Twitter. And a good example of how useful it can be but also how difficult was the Egyptian revolution in     . As a non Arabic speaker  as someone who was looking from the outside  from Dublin  Twitter lists  and lists of good sources  people we could establish were credible  were really important. And how do you build a list like that from scratch  Well  it can be quite difficult  but you have to know what to look for. This visualization was done by an Italian academic. He's called Andr  Pannison  and he basically took the Twitter conversation in Tahrir Square on the day that Hosni Mubarak would eventually resign  and the dots you can see are retweets  so when someone retweets a message  a connection is made between two dots  and the more times that message is retweeted by other people  the more you get to see these nodes  these connections being made. And it's an amazing way of visualizing the conversation  but what you get is hints at who is more interesting and who is worth investigating. And as the conversation grew and grew  it became more and more lively  and eventually you were left with this huge  big  rhythmic pointer of this conversation. You could find the nodes  though  and then you went  and you go   Right  I've got to investigate these people. These are the ones that are obviously making sense. Let's see who they are.  Now in the deluge of information  this is where the real time web gets really interesting for a journalist like myself  because we have more tools than ever to do that kind of investigation. And when you start digging into the sources  you can go further and further than you ever could before. Sometimes you come across a piece of content that is so compelling  you want to use it  you're dying to use it  but you're not     percent sure if you can because you don't know if the source is credible. You don't know if it's a scrape. You don't know if it's a re upload. And you have to do that investigative work. And this video  which I'm going to let run through  was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago. Video  Getting real windy in just a second. Markham Nolan  Okay  so now if you're a news producer  this is something you'd love to run with  because obviously  this is gold. You know  This is a fantastic reaction from someone  very genuine video that they've shot in their back garden. But how do you find if this person  if it's true  if it's faked  or if it's something that's old and that's been reposted  So we set about going to work on this video  and the only thing that we had to go on was the username on the YouTube account. There was only one video posted to that account  and the username was Rita Krill. And we didn't know if Rita existed or if it was a fake name. But we started looking  and we used free Internet tools to do so. The first one was called Spokeo  which allowed us to look for Rita Krills. So we looked all over the U.S. We found them in New York  we found them in Pennsylvania  Nevada and Florida. So we went and we looked for a second free Internet tool called Wolfram Alpha  and we checked the weather reports for the day in which this video had been uploaded  and when we went through all those various cities  we found that in Florida  there were thunderstorms and rain on the day. So we went to the white pages  and we found  we looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook  and we looked through a couple of different addresses  and that took us to Google Maps  where we found a house. And we found a house with a swimming pool that looked remarkably like Rita's. So we went back to the video  and we had to look for clues that we could cross reference. So if you look in the video  there's the big umbrella  there's a white lilo in the pool  there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool  and there's two trees in the background. And we went back to Google Maps  and we looked a little bit closer  and sure enough  there's the white lilo  there are the two trees  there's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo. Little bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool. So we were able to call Rita  clear the video  make sure that it had been shot  and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried. Sometimes the search for truth  though  is a little bit less flippant  and it has much greater consequences. Syria has been really interesting for us  because obviously a lot of the time you're trying to debunk stuff that can be potentially war crime evidence  so this is where YouTube actually becomes the most important repository of information about what's going on in the world. So this video  I'm not going to show you the whole thing  because it's quite gruesome  but you'll hear some of the sounds. This is from Hama. Video   Shouting  And what this video shows  when you watch the whole thing through  is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge. The allegations were that these guys were Muslim Brotherhood and they were throwing Syrian Army officers' bodies off the bridge  and they were cursing and using blasphemous language  and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were  and whether or not they were what the video said it was. So we talked to some sources in Hama who we had been back and forth with on Twitter  and we asked them about this  and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify. Three different sources said three different things about the bridge. They said  one  the bridge doesn't exist. Another one said the bridge does exist  but it's not in Hama. It's somewhere else. And the third one said   I think the bridge does exist  but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed  so the river should actually have been dry  so this doesn't make sense.  So that was the only one that gave us a clue. We looked through the video for other clues. We saw the distinctive railings  which we could use. We looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south  so we could tell the bridge was running east west across the river. It had black and white curbs. As we looked at the river itself  you could see there's a concrete stone on the west side. There's a cloud of blood. That's blood in the river. So the river is flowing south to north. That's what that tells me. And also  as you look away from the bridge  there's a divot on the left hand side of the bank  and the river narrows. So onto Google Maps we go  and we start looking through literally every single bridge. We go to the dam that we talked about  we start just literally going through every time that road crosses the river  crossing off the bridges that don't match. We're looking for one that crosses east west. And we get to Hama. We get all the way from the dam to Hama and there's no bridge. So we go a bit further. We switch to the satellite view  and we find another bridge  and everything starts to line up. The bridge looks like it's crossing the river east to west. So this could be our bridge. And we zoom right in. We start to see that it's got a median  so it's a two lane bridge. And it's got the black and white curbs that we saw in the video  and as we click through it  you can see someone's uploaded photos to go with the map  which is very handy  so we click into the photos. And the photos start showing us more detail that we can cross reference with the video. The first thing that we see is we see black and white curbing  which is handy because we've seen that before. We see the distinctive railing that we saw the guys throwing the bodies over. And we keep going through it until we're certain that this is our bridge. So what does that tell me  I've got to go back now to my three sources and look at what they told me  the one who said the bridge didn't exist  the one who said the bridge wasn't in Hama  and the one guy who said   Yes  the bridge does exist  but I'm not sure about the water levels.  Number three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden  and we've been able to find that out using some free Internet tools sitting in a cubicle in an office in Dublin in the space of    minutes. And that's part of the joy of this. Although the web is running like a torrent  there's so much information there that it's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day  if you use them intelligently  you can find out incredible information. Given a couple of clues  I could probably find out a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out. But what it tells me is that  at a time when there's more    there's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been  it's harder to filter  we have greater tools. We have free Internet tools that allow us  help us do this kind of investigation. We have algorithms that are smarter than ever before  and computers that are quicker than ever before. But here's the thing. Algorithms are rules. They're binary. They're yes or no  they're black or white. Truth is never binary. Truth is a value. Truth is emotional  it's fluid  and above all  it's human. No matter how quick we get with computers  no matter how much information we have  you'll never be able to remove the human from the truth seeking exercise  because in the end  it is a uniquely human trait. Thanks very much.  Applause  Hello  Doha. Hello  Salaam alaikum. I love coming to Doha. It's such an international place. It feels like the United Nations here. You land at the airport  and you're welcomed by an Indian lady who takes you to Al Maha Services  where you meet a Filipino lady who hands you off to a South African lady who then takes you to a Korean who takes you to a Pakistani guy with the luggage who takes you to the car with a Sri Lankan. You go to the hotel and you check in. There's a Lebanese. Yeah  And then a Swedish guy showed me my room. I said   Where are the Qataris   They said   No  no  it's too hot. They come out later. They're smart.   They know.  And of course  it's growing so fast  sometimes there's growing pains. You know  like sometimes you run into people that you think know the city well  but they don't know it that well. My Indian cab driver showed up at the W  and I asked him to take me to the Sheraton  and he said   No problem  sir.  And then we sat there for two minutes. I said   What's wrong   He said   One problem  sir.  I said   What   He goes   Where is it   I go   You're the driver  you should know.  He goes   No  I just arrived  sir.  I go   You just arrived at the W    No  I just arrived in Doha  sir.   I was on my way home from the airport  I got a job. I'm working already.  He goes   Sir  why don't you drive    I don't know where we're going.   Neither do I. It will be an adventure  sir.  The Middle East has been an adventure the past couple of years. It is going crazy with the Arab Spring and revolution and all this. Are there any Lebanese here tonight  by applause  Lebanese  yeah. The Middle East is going crazy. You know the Middle East is going crazy when Lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region. Who would have thought  Oh my gosh. No  there's serious issues in the region. Some people don't want to talk about them. I'm here to talk about them tonight. Ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East  here's a serious issue. When we see each other  when we say hello  how many kisses are we going to do  Every country is different and it's confusing  okay  In Lebanon  they do three. In Egypt  they do two. I was in Lebanon  I got used to three. I went to Egypt. I went to say hello to this one Egyptian guy  I went  one  two. I went for three    He wasn't into it. I told him  I said   No  no  I was just in Lebanon.  He goes   I don't care where you were. You just stay where you are  please.  I went to Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia  they go one  two  and then they stay on the same side  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine                                        Next time you see a Saudi  look closely. They're just a little bit tilted.  Abdul  are you okay    I was saying hello for half an hour. I'll be all right.  Qataris  you guys do the nose to nose. Why is that  Are you too tired to go all the way around   Habibi  it's so hot. Just come here for a second. Say hello. Hello  Habibi. Just don't move. Just stay there  please. I need to rest.  Iranians  sometimes we do two  sometimes we do three. A friend of mine explained to me  before the '   revolution  it was two. After the revolution  three. So with Iranians  you can tell whose side the person is on based on the number of kisses they give you. Yeah  if you go one  two  three     I can't believe you support this regime    With your three kisses.  But no  guys  really  it is exciting to be here  and like I said  you guys are doing a lot culturally  you know  and it's amazing  and it helps change the image of the Middle East in the West. A lot of Americans don't know a lot about us  about the Middle East. I'm Iranian and American. I'm there. I know  I've traveled here. There's so much  we laugh  right  People don't know we laugh. When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour  it came out on Comedy Central  I went online to see what people were saying. I ended up on a conservative website. One guy wrote another guy. He said   I never knew these people laughed.  Think about it. You never see us laughing in American film or television  right  Maybe like an evil laugh   Wuhahaha.   I will kill you in the name of Allah  wuhahahahaha.  But never like   Ha ha ha ha la.  We like to laugh. We like to celebrate life. And I wish more Americans would travel here. I always encourage my friends   Travel  see the Middle East  there's so much to see  so many good people.  And it's vice versa  and it helps stop problems of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening. For example  I don't know if you heard about this  a little while ago in the US  there was a Muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane  talking about the safest place to sit on the plane. Some passengers overheard them  somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk  got them kicked off the plane. It was a family  a mother  father  child  talking about the seating. As a Middle Eastern male  I know there's certain things I'm not supposed to say on an airplane in the US  right  I'm not supposed to be walking down the aisle  and be like   Hi  Jack.  That's not cool. Even if I'm there with my friend named Jack  I say   Greetings  Jack. Salutations  Jack.  Never  Hi  Jack.  But now  apparently we can't even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane. So my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim  so to  you know  Indians  and Latinos  everyone  if you're brown    Here's my advice to my brown friends. The next time you're on an airplane in the US  just speak your mother tongue. That way no one knows what you're saying. Life goes on. Granted  some mother tongues might sound a little threatening to the average American. If you're walking down the aisle speaking Arabic  you might freak them out    They might say   What's he talking about   The key  to my Arab brothers and sisters  is to throw in random good words to put people at ease as you're walking down the aisle. Just as you're walking down    Strawberry  Rainbow  Tutti Frutti   I think he's going to hijack the plane with some ice cream.  Thank you very much. Have a good night. Thank you  TED. This is poo  and what I want to do today is share my passion for poo with you  which might be quite difficult  but I think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo. So this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice  and yet it can do things that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing. And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source  which is dung. So the question is  where do we start this story  And it seems appropriate to start at the end  because this is a waste product that comes out of other animals  but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living  and so dung beetles eat dung  and their larvae are also dung feeders. They are grown completely in a ball of dung. Within South Africa  we've got about     species of dung beetles  in Africa we've got       species of dung beetles  and in the world we have about       species of dung beetles. So  according to dung beetles  dung is pretty good. Unless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself  you'll never see    percent of the dung beetle species  because they go directly into the dung  straight down below it  and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground. So the question is  how do they deal with this material  And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort. Ten percent of the species actually make a ball  and this ball they roll away from the dung source  usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source  and they have a very particular behavior by which they are able to roll their balls. So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball. You can see it's a male because he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there  and he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there. And then he's about to become a victim of a vicious smash and grab.  Laughter  And this is a clear indication that this is a valuable resource. And so valuable resources have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way  and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because of this  because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung. So this dung pat was actually    well  it was a dung pat    minutes before this photograph was taken  and we think it's the intense competition that makes the beetles so well adapted to rolling balls of dung. So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the African veld. Its head is down. It's walking backwards. It's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction  and at the same time it's got to deal with the heat. This is Africa. It's hot. So what I want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems. So watch this beetle  and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of. The first is how it deals with this obstacle that we've put in its way. See  look  it does a little dance  and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place. A little dance  and then heads off in a particular direction. So clearly this animal knows where it's going and it knows where it wants to go  and that's a very  very important thing  because if you think about it  you're at the dung pile  you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else  and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line. So we gave them some more tasks to deal with  and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet. And watch its response. So this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet. It's turned by    degrees. But it doesn't flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go  and it heads off in that particular direction. So our next question then was  how are they doing this  What are they doing  And there was a cue that was available to us. It was that every now and then they'd climb on top of the ball and they'd take a look at the world around them. And what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball  What are the obvious cues that this animal could use to direct its movement  And the most obvious one is to look at the sky  and so we thought  now what could they be looking at in the sky  And the obvious thing to look at is the sun. So a classic experiment here  in that what we did was we moved the sun. What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position. And look at what the beetle does. It does a little double dance  and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first place. What happens now  So clearly they're looking at the sun. The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them. The thing is the sun is not always available to you  because at sunset it disappears below the horizon. What is happening in the sky here is that there's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky that you and I can't see. It's the way our eyes are built. But the sun is at the horizon over here and we know that when the sun is at the horizon  say it's over on this side  there is a north south  a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can't see that the beetles can see. So how do we test that  Well  that's easy. What we do is we get a great big polarization filter  pop the beetle underneath it  and the filter is at right angles to the polarization pattern of the sky. The beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right hand turn  because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in. So obviously beetles can see polarized light. Okay  so what we've got so far is  what are beetles doing  They're rolling balls. How are they doing it  Well  they're rolling them in a straight line. How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line  Well  they're looking at celestial cues in the sky  some of which you and I can't see. But how do they pick up those celestial cues  That was what was of interest to us next. And it was this particular little behavior  the dance  that we thought was important  because look  it takes a pause every now and then  and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in. So what are they doing when they do this dance  How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves  And in this experiment here  what we did was we forced them into a channel  and you can see he wasn't particularly forced into this particular channel  and we gradually displaced the beetle by     degrees until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction that it wanted to go in  in the first place. And let's see what his reaction is as he's headed through    degrees here  and now he's going to    when he ends up down here  he's going to be     degrees in the wrong direction. And see what his response is. He does a little dance  he turns around  and heads back in this. He knows exactly where he's going. He knows exactly what the problem is  and he knows exactly how to deal with it  and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorientate themselves. So that's the dance  but after spending many years sitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days  we noticed that there was another behavior associated with the dance behavior. Every now and then  when they climb on top of the ball  they wipe their face. And you see him do it again. Now we thought  now what could be going on here  Clearly the ground is very hot  and when the ground is hot  they dance more often  and when they do this particular dance  they wipe the bottom of their face. And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior. We thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face to cool their head down. So what we did was design a couple of arenas. one was hot  one was cold. We shaded this one. We left that one hot. And then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera. So what you're looking at here is a heat image of the system  and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball. So the truth is  if you look at the temperature over here  dung is cool.  Laughter  So all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature of the beetle against the background. So the background here is around about    degrees centigrade. The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about    to    degrees centigrade  so this is a great big ball of ice cream that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld. It isn't climbing. It isn't dancing  because its body temperature is actually relatively low. It's about the same as yours and mine. And what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool. But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment  look at the temperature of the soil. It's up around    to    degrees centigrade. Watch how often the beetle dances. And look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot. So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow  and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face  and all the time it's trying to cool itself down  we think  and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across. And what we did then was put little boots on these legs  because this was a way to test if the legs were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil. And if you look over here  with boots they climb onto the ball far less often when they had no boots on. So we described these as cool boots. It was a dental compound that we used to make these boots. And we also cooled down the dung ball  so we were able to put the ball in the fridge  gave them a nice cool dung ball  and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball. So this is called stilting. It's a thermal behavior that you and I do if we cross the beach  we jump onto a towel  somebody has this towel     Sorry  I've jumped onto your towel.     and then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel  and that way you don't burn your feet. And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here. However  there's one more story I'd like to share with you  and that's this particular species. It's from a genus called Pachysoma. There are    species in the genus  and they have a particular behavior that I think you will find interesting. This is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing. Can you spot the difference  They don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion. but it's walking forwards  and it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it. This is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior. There's one more interesting aspect of this dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating  and that's that it forages and provisions a nest. So watch this individual here  and what he's trying to do is set up a nest. And he doesn't like this first position  but he comes up with a second position  and about    minutes later  that nest is finished  and he heads off to forage and provision at a pile of dry dung pellets. And what I want you to notice is the outward path compared to the homeward path  and compare the two. And by and large  you'll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path. On the outward path  he's always on the lookout for a new blob of dung. On the way home  he knows where home is  and he wants to go straight to it. The important thing here is that this is not a one way trip  as in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeated back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site. And watch  you're going to see another South African crime taking place right now.  Laughter  And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets. So what we're looking at here is a behavior called path integration. And what's taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot  it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food  and then when it finds food  it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is. Now there's two ways it could be doing that  and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it's at the foraging site. If it's using landmarks  it will find its home. If it is using something called path integration  it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot  and what it's doing here if it's using path integration is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction. It knows the bearing home  and it knows it should be in that direction. If you displace it  it ends up in the wrong place. So let's see what happens when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment. So here's our cunning experimenter. He displaces the beetle  and now we have to see what is going to take place. What we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was. The forage has been displaced to a new position. If he's using landmark orientation  he should be able to find the burrow  because he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it. If he's using path integration  then it should end up in the wrong spot over here. So let's watch what happens when we put the beetle through the whole test. So there he is there. He's about to head home  and look what happens. Shame. It hasn't a clue. It starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food  but it is clearly completely lost. So we know now that this animal uses path integration to find its way around  and the callous experimenter leads it top left and leaves it.  Laughter  So what we're looking at here are a group of animals that use a compass  and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around  and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance  and we know that these species here actually count the steps. That's what they use as an odometer  a step counting system  to find their way back home. We don't know yet what dung beetles use. So what have we learned from these animals with a brain that's the size of a grain of rice  Well  we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues. We know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior and it's also a thermoregulation behavior  and we also know that they use a path integration system for finding their way home. So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance we can actually learn an awful lot from these things doing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do. Thank you.  Applause  I essentially drag sledges for a living  so it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually  but I'm going to read this question from an interview earlier this year   Philosophically  does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving  After all  if it is being done somewhere by someone  and we can participate virtually  then why bother leaving the house   I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer. I'm not sure that's the most progressive or   st century of job titles  but I've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle  so I get out of the house a fair bit. And in my nature  I guess  I am a doer of things more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things  and it's that dichotomy  the gulf between ideas and action that I'm going to try and explore briefly. The pithiest answer to the question  why   that's been dogging me for the last    years was credited certainly to this chap  the rakish looking gentleman standing at the back  second from the left  George Lee Mallory. Many of you will know his name. In      he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of Mt. Everest. He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest  more than    years before Edmund Hillary. No one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery. But he was credited with coining the phrase   Because it's there.  Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that. There's very little evidence to suggest it  but what he did say is actually far nicer  and again  I've printed this. I'm going to read it out.  The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this  What is the use of climbing Mt. Everest  And my answer must at once be  it is no use. There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever. Oh  we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes  and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation  but otherwise nothing will come of it. We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver  and not a gem  nor any coal or iron. We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food. So it is no use. If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it  that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward  then you won't see why we go. What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy  and joy  after all  is the end of life. We don't live to eat and make money. We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life. That is what life means  and that is what life is for.  Mallory's argument that leaving the house  embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun  however  doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience. The furthest I've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of     . I still don't know exactly what came over me  but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean. I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia to the North Pole  and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada. No one had ever done this. I was    at the time. A lot of experts were saying it was impossible  and my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea. The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point  the edge of the pack ice  the coast of the Arctic Ocean  took about five hours  and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up  rather than just coming down  you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension  as I sat in a helicopter thundering north  and the sense  I think if anything  of impending doom. I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into. There was a bit of fun  a bit of joy. I was   . I remember sitting there looking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go  I had a satellite phone  a pump action shotgun in case I was attacked by a polar bear. I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter. We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn  and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me felt quite proud of myself  but mostly I was just utterly terrified. And that journey lasted    weeks     days. I didn't see anyone else. We took this photo next to the helicopter. Beyond that  I didn't see anyone for    weeks. The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea  so I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean. NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began. I was dragging     kilos of food and fuel and supplies  about     pounds. The average temperature for the    weeks was minus   . Minus    was the coldest. So again  there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had. One of the magical things about this journey  however  is that because I'm walking over the sea  over this floating  drifting  shifting crust of ice that's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is it's an environment that's in a constant state of flux. The ice is always moving  breaking up  drifting around  refreezing  so the scenery that I saw for nearly   months was unique to me. No one else will ever  could ever  possibly see the views  the vistas  that I saw for    weeks. And that  I guess  is probably the finest argument for leaving the house. I can try to tell you what it was like  but you'll never know what it was like  and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely  I was the only human being in  .  million square miles  it was cold  nearly minus    with windchill on a bad day  the more words fall short  and I'm unable to do it justice. And it seems to me  therefore  that the doing  you know  to try to experience  to engage  to endeavor  rather than to watch and to wonder  that's where the real meat of life is to be found  the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days. And I would add a cautionary note here  however. In my experience  there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible. Now I don't just mean in the field of daft macho Edwardian style derring do  but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer  there is something addictive about this  and in my case  I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit. I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it  but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on  to ruin every relationship I've ever had  so be careful what you wish for. Mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain  and I wonder if that's the case whether there's something in the challenge itself  in the endeavor  and particularly in the big  unfinished  chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us  and in my experience that's certainly the case. There is one unfinished challenge that's been calling out to me for most of my adult life. Many of you will know the story. This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team. Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole. No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica. Scott  as many of you will know  was beaten to it by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team  who used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot  all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges  and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there  I'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized. All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey. There is a sort of misconception nowadays that it's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure. When I talk about Antarctica  people often say   Hasn't  you know  that's interesting  hasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike   Or   That's nice. You know  my grandmother's going on a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know. Is there a chance you'll see her there   But Scott's journey remains unfinished. No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again. It is  arguably  the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration  and it seemed to me high time  given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels  that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job. So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do. This time next year  in October  I'm leading a team of three. It will take us about four months to make this return journey. That's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole. We have to turn around and come back again. I'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before. And it'll also be a four month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question   Why   And our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call for explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option. If I wanted to know  for example  how many stars were in the Milky Way  how old those giant heads on Easter Island were  most of you could find that out right now without even standing up. And yet  if I've learned anything in nearly    years now of dragging heavy things around cold places  it is that true  real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge  from stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown. In life  we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to  and I think metaphorically speaking  at least  we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often  if only we could summon up the courage. I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what's outside. Thank you very much. Twelve years ago  I founded Zipcar. Zipcar buys cars and parks them throughout dense metropolitan areas for people to use  by the hour and by the day  instead of owning their own cars. Each Zipcar replaces    personal cars  and each driver drives about    percent less because they're now paying the full cost  all at once  in real time. But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm. Now  a decade later  it's really time to push the envelope a little bit  and so a couple years ago I moved to Paris with my husband and youngest child  and we launched Buzzcar a year ago. Buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors. Instead of investing in a car  we invest in a community. We bring the power of a corporation to individuals who add their cars to the network. Some people call this peer to peer. This does express the humanity of what's going on  and the personal relationships  but that is also like saying that it's the same thing as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting. That's peer to peer. It's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay  or craft fairs are the same thing as Etsy. But what's really happening is that we've got the power of a free and open Internet  and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation  and the peers are now in partnership with the company  creating shared value on shared values  and each strengthening the other  and doing what the other can't do. I call this Peers  Inc. The incorporated side  the company  is doing things that it does really well. What does it do really well  It creates economies of scale  significant and long term resource investment  the expertise of many different kinds of people and different kinds of minds  and for individuals  consumers  it's bringing the standards  rules and recourse that we really want as consumers  and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise  and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation. Peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do. What do they bring  They bring this fabulous diversity  expensive for companies. And what does that deliver  It delivers localization and customization  specialization  and all of this aspect about social networks and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there  It's natural for me. Me and my friends  I can connect to them easily. And it also delivers really fabulous innovation  and I'll talk about that later. So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product  and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do. The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds. Some of my favorite examples  in transportation  Carpooling.com. Ten years old  three and a half million people have joined up  and a million rides are shared every day. It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent of       TGV trains  and just think  they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car. This is all happening with excess capacity. And it's not just with transportation  my love  but of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com. I met these founders just weeks after they had launched  and now  in two years  what would you do for five dollars  Seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years  what people would do for five dollars. And not just easy things that anyone can do. This Peers  Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm. TopCoder has         engineers who are delivering complex design and engineering services. When I talked to their CEO  he had this great line. He said   We have a community that owns its own company.  And then my all time favorite  Etsy. Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they're selling it in a marketplace. It just celebrated its seventh anniversary  and after seven years  last year it delivered     million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects. I know you guys out there who are businesspeople  are thinking   Oh my God  I want to build one of those. I see this incredible speed and scale. You mean all I have to do is build a platform and all these people are going to put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in   Building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do. I think of the difference of Google Video versus YouTube. Who would have thought that two young guys and a start up would beat out Google Video  Why  I actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them. But I'm thinking  you know  they probably had the  share  button a little bit brighter and to the right  and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides that are always participating on these networks. So I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now  and a Peers  Inc. company  because I've spent the last two years doing that in Paris. So let me take you back how it's so incredibly different building Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar  because now every single thing we do has these two different bodies that I have to be thinking about  the owners who are going to provide the cars and the drivers who are going to rent them. Every single decision  I have to think about what is right for both sides. There are many  many examples and I'll give you one that is not my favorite example  insurance. It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right. Hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative  they'd never thought of it before. Way too much money  I just can't even go there  with lawyers  trying to figure out how this is different  who's responsible to whom  and the result was that we were able to provide owners protection for their own driving records and their own history. The cars are completely insured during the rental  and it gives drivers what they need  and what do they need  They need a low deductible  and    hour roadside assistance. So this was a trick to get these two sides. So now I want to take you to the moment of    When you're an entrepreneur  and you've started a new company  there's the  here's all the stuff we do beforehand  and then the service launches. What happens  So all those months of work  they come into play. Last June    we launched. It was an exciting moment. And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting. All the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent. The reservations start coming in  and here  owners who were getting text messages and emails that said   Hey  Joe wants to rent your car for the weekend. You can earn    euros. Isn't that great  Yes or no   No reply. Like  a huge proportion of them couldn't be bothered after they had just started  they just signed up  to reply. So I thought   Duh  Robin  this is the difference between industrial production and peer production.  Industrial production  the whole point of industrial production is to provide a standardized  exact service model that is consistent every single time  and I'm really thankful that my smartphone is made using industrial production. And Zipcar provides a very nice  consistent service that works fabulously. But what does peer production do  Peer production is this completely different way of doing things  and you have a big quality range  and so eBay  cleverly  the first peer production  Peer  Inc. company  I'd say  they figured out early on  we need to have ratings and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff. We can flag that and we can put it to the side  and people who are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it. So going back  this is my look of excitement and joy  because all this stuff that I'd also been hoping for actually really did happen  and what's that  That is the diversity of what's going on. You have these different fabulous owners and their different cars  different prices  different locations.  Laughter  They dress differently  and they look different  and  really  I love these photos every time I look at them. Cool guys  excited guys  and here is Selma  who    I love this driver. And after a year  we have       cars that are parked across France and       people who are members and eager to drive them. This would not be possible to do that in economic fashion for a traditional company. Back to this spectrum. So what's happening is  we had the yuck side  but we actually had this real wow side. And I can tell you two great stories. A driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them  and said   You know what  here's where the cliffs are  and here's all the beaches  and this is my best beach  and this is where the best fish restaurant is.  And the peers also become  peers and owners create relationships  and so at the last minute people can    a driver can say   Hey  you know what  I really need the car  is it available   And that person will say   Sure  my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it.  So you can have these really nice things that can't happen  and it's a kind of  Wow   and I want to say  Wow   type of thing that's happening here  because individuals  if you're a company  what happens is you might have    people who are in charge of innovation  or     people who are in charge of innovation. What happens in Peer  Inc. companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model  and so out of all that influence and that effort  you are having this exceptional amount of innovation that is coming out. So one of the reasons  if we come back to why did I call it Buzzcar  I wanted to remind all of us about the power of the hive  and its incredible facility to create this platform that individuals want to participate and innovate on. And for me  when I think about our future  and all of those problems that seem incredibly large  the scale is impossible  the urgency is there  Peers  Inc. provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems. All we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation    nontrivial. So I continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe. All problems come back to transportation for me. But there are all these other areas that are these profound  big problems that I know that we can work on  and people are working on them in many different sectors  but there's this really fabulous group of things with the power of this Peers  Inc. model. So over the last decade  we've been reveling in the power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals  and for me  what Peers  Inc. does is it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the power of the company and the corporation and supercharging individuals. So for me  it's a collaboration. Together  we can.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  I'm a neuroscientist  and I study decision making. I do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make. I'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision making  a cheese sandwich. That's right. According to scientists  a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions. How do I know  I'm the scientist who did the study. A few years ago  my colleagues and I were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people's decisions in social situations. Specifically  we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react when they're treated unfairly. So we did an experiment. We manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them this really disgusting tasting artificial lemon flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain. This is the amino acid tryptophan. So what we found was  when tryptophan was low  people were more likely to take revenge when they're treated unfairly. That's the study we did  and here are some of the headlines that came out afterwards. And I thought the same thing myself when these came out  because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate. We gave people this horrible tasting drink that affected their tryptophan levels. But it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate. And of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decisions  well  that's sure to grab people's attention. So there you have it  the evolution of a headline. When this happened  a part of me thought  well  what's the big deal  So the media oversimplified a few things  but in the end  it's just a news story. And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude. But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time  and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shelves. When the headlines rolled  what happened was  the marketers came calling. Would I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood boosting bottled water  Or would I go on television to demonstrate  in front of a live audience  that comfort foods really do make you feel better  I think these folks meant well  but had I taken them up on their offers  I would have been going beyond the science  and good scientists are careful not to do this. But nevertheless  neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing. Here's one example  Neuro drinks  a line of products  including Nuero Bliss here  which according to its label helps reduce stress  enhances mood  provides focused concentration  and promotes a positive outlook. I have to say  this sounds awesome.  Laughter  I could totally have used this    minutes ago. So when this came up in my local shop  naturally I was curious about some of the research backing these claims. So I went to the company's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products. But I didn't find any. Trial or no trial  these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain. And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties. A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article. For half the people  the article included a brain image  and for the other half  it was the same article but it didn't have a brain image. At the end   you see where this is going   people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article. So this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image. And this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image. So the take home message here is  do you want to sell it  Put a brain on it. Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades  and we're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain. Like  just a couple of weeks ago  neuroscientists at MIT figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain. Really cool stuff. But the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations and some overblown  unproven claims. So what I'm going to do is show you how to spot a couple of classic moves  dead giveaways  really  for what's variously been called neuro bunk  neuro bollocks  or  my personal favorite  neuro flapdoodle. So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people's thoughts and emotions. Here's a study published by a team of researchers as an op ed in The New York Times. The headline   You Love Your iPhone. Literally.  It quickly became the most emailed article on the site. So how'd they figure this out  They put    people inside a brain scanner and showed them videos of ringing iPhones. The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula  a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion. So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula  this meant the subjects loved their iPhones. Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning  and that's that the insula does a lot. Sure  it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion  but it's also involved in tons of other processes  like memory  language  attention  even anger  disgust and pain. So based on the same logic  I could equally conclude you hate your iPhone. The point here is  when you see activation in the insula  you can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation from off this list  and it's a really long list. My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published. So chances are really  really good that your insula is going off right now  but I won't kid myself to think this means you love me. So speaking of love and the brain  there's a researcher  known to some as Dr. Love  who claims that scientists have found the glue that holds society together  the source of love and prosperity. This time it's not a cheese sandwich. No  it's a hormone called oxytocin. You've probably heard of it. So  Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people's oxytocin  this increases their trust  empathy and cooperation. So he's calling oxytocin  the moral molecule.  Now these studies are scientifically valid  and they've been replicated  but they're not the whole story. Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy. It increases gloating. Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group at the expense of other groups. And in some cases  oxytocin can even decrease cooperation. So based on these studies  I could say oxytocin is an immoral molecule  and call myself Dr. Strangelove. So we've seen neuro flapdoodle all over the headlines. We see it in supermarkets  on book covers. What about the clinic  SPECT imaging is a brain scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain. For the bargain price of a few thousand dollars  there are clinics in the U.S. that will give you one of these SPECT scans and use the image to help diagnose your problems. These scans  the clinics say  can help prevent Alzheimer's disease  solve weight and addiction issues  overcome marital conflicts  and treat  of course  a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD. This sounds great. A lot of people agree. Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business. There's just one problem. The broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can't yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan. But these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date  many of them children  and SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection  so exposing people to radiation  potentially harmful. I am more excited than most people  as a neuroscientist  about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness and even maybe to make us better and smarter. And if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate help us make better decisions  count me in. But we're not there yet. We haven't found a  buy  button inside the brain  we can't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans  and we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones. Maybe someday we will  but until then  we have to be careful that we don't let overblown claims detract resources and attention away from the real science that's playing a much longer game. So here's where you come in. If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it  don't just take them at their word. Ask the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence. Ask for the part of the story that's not being told. The answers shouldn't be simple  because the brain isn't simple. But that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway. Thank you.  Applause  Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera  but today I want to share with you the    most treasured photos of mine  and I didn't take any of them. There were no art directors  no stylists  no chance for reshoots  not even any regard for lighting. In fact  most of them were taken by random tourists. My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement  and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of   th and  th. We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later  so we decided to take the same picture. Well you can see where this is going. Approaching my daughter's third birthday  my wife said   Hey  why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father daughter trip  and continue the ritual   This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture. You know  it's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger. No one's ever refused  and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera. Back then  we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives. It's really become sacred to us. This one was taken just weeks after       and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five year old could understand. So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment  or even a specific trip. They're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year  and not just physically  but in every way. Because while we take the same photo  our perspectives change  and she reaches new milestones  and I get to see life through her eyes  and how she interacts with and sees everything. This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year. Recently  on one trip  we were walking  and she stops dead in her tracks  and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips. And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five year old standing in that exact spot. She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier. And now what she's looking at in New York are colleges  because she's determined to go to school in New York. And it hit me  One of the most important things we all make are memories. So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories. I don't know about you  but aside from these    shots  I'm not in many of the family photos. I'm always the one taking the picture. So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot  and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask   Will you take our picture   Thank you.  Applause  So a friend of mine who's a political scientist  he told me several months ago exactly what this month would be like. He said  you know  there's this fiscal cliff coming  it's going to come at the beginning of     . Both parties absolutely need to resolve it  but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it. Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due  so he said  December  you're just going to see lots of angry negotiations  negotiations breaking apart  reports of phone calls that aren't going well  people saying nothing's happening at all  and then sometime around Christmas or New Year's  we're going to hear   Okay  they resolved everything.  He told me that a few months ago. He said he's    percent positive they're going to resolve it  and I got an email from him today saying  all right  we're basically on track  but now I'm    percent positive that they're going to resolve it. And it made me think. I love studying these moments in American history when there was this frenzy of partisan anger  that the economy was on the verge of total collapse. The most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be and how it would be backed up  with Alexander Hamilton saying   We need a central bank  the First Bank of the United States  or else the dollar will have no value. This economy won't work   and Thomas Jefferson saying   The people won't trust that. They just fought off a king. They're not going to accept some central authority.  This battle defined the first     years of the U.S. economy  and at every moment  different partisans saying   Oh my God  the economy's about to collapse   and the rest of us just going about  spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy. To give you a quick primer on where we are  a quick refresher on where we are. So the fiscal cliff  I was told that that's too partisan a thing to say  although I can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking. People say we should call it the fiscal slope  or we should call it an austerity crisis  but then other people say  no  that's even more partisan. So I just call it the self imposed  self destructive arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem. And this is what the inevitable problem looks like. So this is a projection of U.S. debt as a percentage of our overall economy  of GDP. The light blue dotted line represents the Congressional Budget Office's best guess of what will happen if Congress really doesn't do anything  and as you can see  sometime around       we reach Greek levels of debt  somewhere around     percent of GDP  which tells you that some time in the next    years  if Congress does absolutely nothing  we're going to hit a moment where the world's investors  the world's bond buyers  are going to say   We don't trust America anymore. We're not going to lend them any money  except at really high interest rates.  And at that moment our economy collapses. But remember  Greece is there today. We're there in    years. We have lots and lots of time to avoid that crisis  and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis. Here's another way to look at exactly the same problem. The dark blue line is how much the government spends. The light blue line is how much the government gets in. And as you can see  for most of recent history  except for a brief period  we have consistently spent more than we take in. Thus the national debt. But as you can also see  projected going forward  the gap widens a bit and raises a bit  and this graph is only through     . It gets really  really ugly out towards     . And this graph sort of sums up what the problem is. The Democrats  they say  well  this isn't a big deal. We can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap  especially if we raise taxes on the rich. The Republicans say  hey  no  no  we've got a better idea. Why don't we lower both lines  Why don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes  and then we'll be on an even more favorable long term deficit trajectory  And behind this powerful disagreement between how to close that gap  there's the worst kind of cynical party politics  the worst kind of insider baseball  lobbying  all of that stuff  but there's also this powerfully interesting  respectful disagreement between two fundamentally different economic philosophies. And I like to think  when I picture how Republicans see the economy  what I picture is just some amazingly well engineered machine  some perfect machine. Unfortunately  I picture it made in Germany or Japan  but this amazing machine that's constantly scouring every bit of human endeavor and taking resources  money  labor  capital  machinery  away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts  and while this might cause temporary dislocation  what it does is it builds up the more productive areas and lets the less productive areas fade away and die  and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient  so much richer for everybody. And this view generally believes that there is a role for government  a small role  to set the rules so people aren't lying and cheating and hurting each other  maybe  you know  have a police force and a fire department and an army  but to have a very limited reach into the mechanisms of this machinery. And when I picture how Democrats and Democratic leaning economists picture this economy  most Democratic economists are  you know  they're capitalists  they believe  yes  that's a good system a lot of the time. It's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use. But that system has tons of problems. Wealth piles up in the wrong places. Wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive. That's not going to create an equitable  fair society. That machine doesn't care about the environment  about racism  about all these issues that make this life worse for all of us  and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses  or from richer sources  and give them to other sources. And when you think about the economy through these two different lenses  you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve  because the worse the crisis gets  the higher the stakes are  the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything. And I can get really despairing. I've spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this  until this year  I learned something that I felt really excited about. I feel like it's really good news  and it's so shocking  I don't like saying it  because I think people won't believe me. But here's what I learned. The American people  taken as a whole  when it comes to these issues  to fiscal issues  are moderate  pragmatic centrists. And I know that's hard to believe  that the American people are moderate  pragmatic centrists. But let me explain what I'm thinking. When you look at how the federal government spends money  so this is the battle right here     percent  more than half  is on Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  a few other health programs     percent defense     percent discretionary  and six percent interest. So when we're talking about cutting government spending  this is the pie we're talking about  and Americans overwhelmingly  and it doesn't matter what party they're in  overwhelmingly like that big    percent chunk. They like Social Security. They like Medicare. They even like Medicaid  even though that goes to the poor and indigent  which you might think would have less support. And they do not want it fundamentally touched  although the American people are remarkably comfortable  and Democrats roughly equal to Republicans  with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable. Social Security is fairly easy to fix. The rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated. So gradually raise Social Security retirement age  maybe only on people not yet born. Americans are about        whether they're Democrats or Republicans. Reduce Medicare for very wealthy seniors  seniors who make a lot of money. Don't even eliminate it. Just reduce it. People generally are comfortable with it  Democrats and Republicans. Raise medical health care contributions  Everyone hates that equally  but Republicans and Democrats hate that together. And so what this tells me is  when you look at the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems  we are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major  major issue. We're comfortable with it needing some tweaks  but we want to keep it. We're not open to a discussion of eliminating it. Now there is one issue that is hyper partisan  and where there is one party that is just spend  spend  spend  we don't care  spend some more  and that of course is Republicans when it comes to military defense spending. They way outweigh Democrats. The vast majority want to protect military defense spending. That's    percent of the budget  and that presents a more difficult issue. I should also note that the  discretionary  spending  which is about    percent of the budget  that is Democratic and Republican issues  so you do have welfare  food stamps  other programs that tend to be popular among Democrats  but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior inducements for oil drilling and other things  which tend to be popular among Republicans. Now when it comes to taxes  there is more disagreement. That's a more partisan area. You have Democrats overwhelmingly supportive of raising the income tax on people who make         dollars a year  Republicans sort of against it  although if you break it out by income  Republicans who make less than        dollars a year like this idea. So basically Republicans who make more than         dollars a year don't want to be taxed. Raising taxes on investment income  you also see about two thirds of Democrats but only one third of Republicans are comfortable with that idea. This brings up a really important point  which is that we tend in this country to talk about Democrats and Republicans and think there's this little group over there called independents that's  what  two percent  If you add Democrats  you add Republicans  you've got the American people. But that is not the case at all. And it has not been the case for most of modern American history. Roughly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats. Around a quarter say that they are Republicans. A tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians  or socialists  or some other small third party  and the largest block     percent  say they're independents. So most Americans are not partisan  and most of the people in the independent camp fall somewhere in between  so even though we have tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues of Democrats and Republicans  we have even more overlap when you add in the independents. Now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues. We get to hate each other on gun control and abortion and the environment  but on these fiscal issues  these important fiscal issues  we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say. And in fact  there's this other group of people who are not as divided as people might think  and that group is economists. I talk to a lot of economists  and back in the '  s and '  s it was ugly being an economist. You were in what they called the saltwater camp  meaning Harvard  Princeton  MIT  Stanford  Berkeley  or you were in the freshwater camp  University of Chicago  University of Rochester. You were a free market capitalist economist or you were a Keynesian liberal economist  and these people didn't go to each other's weddings  they snubbed each other at conferences. It's still ugly to this day  but in my experience  it is really  really hard to find an economist under    who still has that kind of way of seeing the world. The vast majority of economists    it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp. The phrase that you want  if you're a graduate student or a postdoc or you're a professor  a    year old economics professor  is   I'm an empiricist. I go by the data.  And the data is very clear. None of these major theories have been completely successful. The   th century  the last hundred years  is riddled with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful  awful job  so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty. They still are an awfully arrogant group of people  I will assure you  but they're now arrogant about their impartiality  and they  too  see a tremendous range of potential outcomes. And this nonpartisanship is something that exists  that has existed in secret in America for years and years and years. I've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major organizations that survey American political attitudes  Pew Research  the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center  and the most important but the least known is the American National Election Studies group that is the world's longest  most respected poll of political attitudes. They've been doing it since       and what they show consistently throughout is that it's almost impossible to find Americans who are consistent ideologically  who consistently support   No we mustn't tax  and we must limit the size of government   or   No  we must encourage government to play a larger role in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism.  Those groups are very  very small. The vast majority of people  they pick and choose  they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument. And that part of it has not changed. What has changed is how people respond to vague questions. If you ask people vague questions  like   Do you think there should be more government or less government    Do you think government should    especially if you use loaded language     Do you think the government should provide handouts   Or   Do you think the government should redistribute   Then you can see radical partisan change. But when you get specific  when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration  people are remarkably centrist  they're remarkably open to compromise. So what we have  then  when you think about the fiscal cliff  don't think of it as the American people fundamentally can't stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate warring nations. Think of it as a tiny  tiny number of ancient economists and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process. And they've captured the process through familiar ways  through a primary system which encourages that small group of people's voices  because that small group of people  the people who answer all yeses or all noes on those ideological questions  they might be small but every one of them has a blog  every one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week. Every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice  but they don't represent us. They don't represent what our views are. And that gets me back to the dollar  and it gets me back to reminding myself that we know this experience. We know what it's like to have these people on TV  in Congress  yelling about how the end of the world is coming if we don't adopt their view completely  because it's happened about the dollar ever since there's been a dollar. We had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton. In       we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve  when it was created  with vicious  angry arguments over how it would be constituted  and a general agreement that the way it was constituted was the worst possible compromise  a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing  this dollar  but then everyone agreeing  okay  so long as we're on the gold standard  it should be okay. The Fed can't mess it up so badly. But then we got off the gold standard for individuals during the Depression and we got off the gold standard as a source of international currency coordination during Richard Nixon's presidency. Each of those times  we were on the verge of complete collapse. And nothing happened at all. Throughout it all  the dollar has been one of the most long standing  stable  reasonable currencies  and we all use it every single day  no matter what the people screaming about tell us  no matter how scared we're supposed to be. And this long term fiscal picture that we're in right now  I think what is most maddening about it is  if Congress were simply able to show not that they agree with each other  not that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise  but that they are able to just begin the process towards compromise  we all instantly are better off. The fear is that the world is watching. The fear is that the longer we delay any solution  the more the world will look to the U.S. not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy  but as a place that can't resolve its own fights  and the longer we put that off  the more we make the world nervous  the higher interest rates are going to be  the quicker we're going to have to face a day of horrible calamity. And so just the act of compromise itself  and sustained  real compromise  would give us even more time  would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain and reach even more compromise down the road. So I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise  to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms that do polarize us  but to just talk about it like what it is  not an existential crisis  not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views  but a math problem  a really solvable math problem  one where we're not all going to get what we want and one where  you know  there's going to be a little pain to spread around. But the more we address it as a practical concern  the sooner we can resolve it  and the more time we have to resolve it  paradoxically. Thank you.  Applause  On March     this year  I posted this poster on Facebook. This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag. I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted. A few days ago  I was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store  and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other  and the owner was explaining to the client that we're going to get        missiles on Israel. And the client was saying  no  it's        a day. We have this war with Iran coming for    years now  and we have people  you know  afraid. It's like every year it's the last minute that we can do something about the war with Iran. It's like  if we don't act now  it's too late forever  for    years now. So at some point it became  you know  to me  I'm a graphic designer  so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before. Most of the time  I make posters  I post them on Facebook  my friends like it  don't like it  most of the time don't like it  don't share it  don't nothing  and it's another day. So I went to sleep  and that was it for me. And later on in the night  I woke up because I'm always waking up in the night  and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots  you know  on Facebook  which I've never seen before. And I was like   What's going on   So I come to the computer and I start looking on  and suddenly I see many people talking to me  most of them I don't know  and a few of them from Iran  which is    What  Because you have to understand  in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran. We don't know people from Iran. It's like  on Facebook  you have friends only from    it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook. And now people from Iran are talking to me. So I start answering this girl  and she's telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come  because they don't have a computer  she asked her family to come to see the poster  and they're all sitting in the living room crying. So I'm like  whoa. I ask my wife to come  and I tell her  you have to see that. People are crying  and she came  she read the text  and she started to cry. And everybody's crying now.  Laughter  So I don't know what to do  so my first reflex  as a graphic designer  is  you know  to show everybody what I'd just seen  and people started to see them and to share them  and that's how it started. The day after  when really it became a lot of talking  I said to myself  and my wife said to me  I also want a poster  so this is her.  Laughter  Because it's working  put me in a poster now. But more seriously  I was like  okay  these ones work  but it's not just about me  it's about people from Israel who want to say something. So I'm going to shoot all the people I know  if they want  and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them. So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them  give me a picture  I will make you a poster. And that's how it started. And that's how  really  it's unleashed  because suddenly people from Facebook  friends and others  just understand that they can be part of it. It's not just one dude making one poster  it's    we can be part of it  so they start sending me pictures and ask me   Make me a poster. Post it. Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too.  It became  you know  at some point it was really  really intense. I mean  so many pictures  so I asked friends to come  graphic designers most of them  to make posters with me  because I didn't have the time. It was a huge amount of pictures. So for a few days  that's how my living room was. And we received Israeli posters  Israeli images  but also lots of comments  lots of messages from Iran. And we took these messages and we made posters out of it  because I know people  They don't read  they see images. If it's an image  they may read it. So here are a few of them. of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning  and now that she sees the posters that we're sending  she starts    she said that she changed her mind  and now she loves that blue  she loves that star  and she loves that flag  talking about the Israeli flag  and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another  and just a few days after I posted the first poster. The day after  Iranians started to respond with their own posters. They have graphic designers. What   Laughter  Crazy  crazy. So you can see they are still shy  they don't want to show their faces  but they want to spread the message. They want to respond. They want to say the same thing. So. And now it's communication. It's a two way story. It's Israelis and Iranians sending the same message  one to each other. This never happened before  and this is two people supposed to be enemies  we're on the verge of a war  and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say   I like this guy. I love those guys.  And it became really big at some point. And then it became news. Because when you're seeing the Middle East  you see only the bad news. And suddenly  there is something that was happening that was good news. So the guys on the news  they say   Okay  let's talk about this.  And they just came  and it was so much  I remember one day  Michal  she was talking with the journalist  and she was asking him   Who's gonna see the show  And he said   Everybody.  So she said   Everybody in Palestine  in where  Israel  Who is everybody   Everybody.  They said   Syria    Syria.   Lebanon   Lebanon.  At some point  he just said      million people are going to see you today. It's everybody.  The Chinese. And we were just at the beginning of the story. Something crazy also happened. Every time a country started talking about it  like Germany  America  wherever  a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories  so at the beginning we had  Iran Loves Israel   which is an Iranian sitting in Tehran  saying   Okay  Israel loves Iran  I give you Iran Loves Israel.  You have Palestine Loves Israel. You have Lebanon that just    a few days ago. And this whole list of pages on Facebook dedicated to the same message  to people sending their love  one to each other. The moment I really understood that something was happening  a friend of mine told me   Google the word 'Israel.'  And those were the first images on those days that popped up from Google when you were typing   Israel  or  Iran.  We really changed how people see the Middle East. Because you're not in the Middle East. You're somewhere over there  and then you want to see the Middle East  so you go on Google and you say   Israel   and they give you the bad stuff. And for a few days you got those images. Today the Israel Loves Iran page is this number          and two million people last week went on the page and shared  liked  I don't know  commented on one of the photos. So for five months now  that's what we are doing  me  Michal  a few of my friends  are just making images. We're showing a new reality by just making images because that's how the world perceives us. They see images of us  and they see bad images. So we're working on making good images. End of story. Look at this one. This is the Iran Loves Israel page. This is not the Israel Loves Iran. This is not my page. This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page. This is the enemy. What  And it's going both ways. It's like  we are showing respect  one to each other. And we're understanding. And you show compassion. And you become friends. And at some point  you become friends on Facebook  and you become friends in life. You can go and travel and meet people. And I was in Munich a few weeks ago. I went there to open an exposition about Iran and I met there with people from the page that told me   Okay  you're going to be in Europe  I'm coming. I'm coming from France  from Holland  from Germany   of course  and from Israel people came  and we just met there for the first time in real life. I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time. And we just shake hands  and have a coffee and a nice discussion  and we talk about food and basketball. And that was the end of it. Remember that image from the beginning  At some point we met in real life  and we became friends. And it goes the other way around. Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel  born and raised in Iran  lives in Germany  afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us  decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel  and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says   Okay  not that big a deal.  So a few weeks ago  the stress is getting higher  so we start this new campaign called  Not ready to die in your war.  I mean  it's plus minus the same message  but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it. And again  something amazing happened  something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign. Now people from Iran  the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent  you know  their foot and half their faces  now they're sending their faces  and they're saying   Okay  no problem  we're into it. We are with you.  Just read where those guys are from. And for every guy from Israel  you've got someone from Iran. Just people sending their pictures. Crazy  yes  So    So you may ask yourself  who is this dude  My name is Ronny Edry  and I'm     I'm an Israeli  I'm a father of two  I'm a husband  and I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design. And I'm not that naive  because a lot of the time I've been asked  many times I've been asked   Yeah  but  this is really naive  sending flowers over  I mean     I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years  and I know how it looks from the ground. I know how it can look really bad. So to me  this is the courageous thing to do  to try to reach the other side before it's too late  because when it's going to be too late  it's going to be too late. And sometimes war is inevitable  sometimes  but maybe  with  effort  we can avoid it. Maybe as people  because especially in Israel  we're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech  and maybe that little thing can change something. And really  we can be our own ambassadors. We can just send a message and hope for the best. So I want to ask Michal  my wife  to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image  because it's all about images. And maybe that image will help us change something. Just raise that. Exactly. And I'm just going to take a picture of it  and I'm just going to post it on Facebook with kind of  Israelis for peace  or something. Oh my God. Don't cry. Thank you guys. One day in             miles off the coast of Chile  in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean     American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater. They'd been struck by a sperm whale  which had ripped a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull. As their ship began to sink beneath the swells  the men huddled together in three small whaleboats. These men were        miles from home  more than       miles from the nearest scrap of land. In their small boats  they carried only rudimentary navigational equipment and limited supplies of food and water. These were the men of the whaleship Essex  whose story would later inspire parts of  Moby Dick.  Even in today's world  their situation would be really dire  but think about how much worse it would have been then. No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong. No search party was coming to look for these men. So most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves  but we all know what it's like to be afraid. We know how fear feels  but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about what our fears mean. As we grow up  we're often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness  just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates. And I think it's no accident that we think this way. Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard wired to be optimists. So maybe that's why we think of fear  sometimes  as a danger in and of itself.  Don't worry   we like to say to one another.  Don't panic.  In English  fear is something we conquer. It's something we fight. It's something we overcome. But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way  What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination  something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself  It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children  whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid. When I was a child  I lived in California  which is  you know  mostly a very nice place to live  but for me as a child  California could also be a little scary. I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier that hung above our dining table swing back and forth during every minor earthquake  and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night  terrified that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping. And what we say about kids who have fears like that is that they have a vivid imagination. But at a certain point  most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up. We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed  and not every earthquake brings buildings down. But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults. The same incredible imaginations that produced  The Origin of Species    Jane Eyre  and  The Remembrance of Things Past   also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of Charles Darwin  Charlotte Bront   and Marcel Proust. So the question is  what can the rest of us learn about fear from visionaries and young children  Well let's return to the year      for a moment  to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex. Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific. Twenty four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship. The time had come for the men to make a plan  but they had very few options. In his fascinating account of the disaster  Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth. The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the Marquesas Islands        miles away. But they'd heard some frightening rumors. They'd been told that these islands  and several others nearby  were populated by cannibals. So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner. Another possible destination was Hawaii  but given the season  the captain was afraid they'd be struck by severe storms. Now the last option was the longest  and the most difficult  to sail       miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of South America. But they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water. To be eaten by cannibals  to be battered by storms  to starve to death before reaching land. These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men  and as it turned out  the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died. Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name. What if instead of calling them fears  we called them stories  Because that's really what fear is  if you think about it. It's a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do. And fears and storytelling have the same components. They have the same architecture. Like all stories  fears have characters. In our fears  the characters are us. Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends. You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails. Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel. Picture a cannibal  human teeth sinking into human skin  human flesh roasting over a fire. Fears also have suspense. If I've done my job as a storyteller today  you should be wondering what happened to the men of the whaleship Essex. Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense. Just like all great stories  our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature  What will happen next  In other words  our fears make us think about the future. And humans  by the way  are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way  of projecting ourselves forward in time  and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling. As a writer  I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction is learning to predict how one event in a story will affect all the other events  and fear works in that same way. In fear  just like in fiction  one thing always leads to another. When I was writing my first novel   The Age Of Miracles   I spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down. What would happen to our days  What would happen to our crops  What would happen to our minds  And then it was only later that I realized how very similar these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night. If an earthquake strikes tonight  I used to worry  what will happen to our house  What will happen to my family  And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story. So if we think of our fears as more than just fears but as stories  we should think of ourselves as the authors of those stories. But just as importantly  we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears  and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives. Now  some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others. I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs  and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called  productive paranoia   which meant that these people  instead of dismissing their fears  these people read them closely  they studied them  and then they translated that fear into preparation and action. So that way  if their worst fears came true  their businesses were ready. And sometimes  of course  our worst fears do come true. That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear. Once in a while  our fears can predict the future. But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears that our imaginations concoct. So how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to and all the others  I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex offers an illuminating  if tragic  example. After much deliberation  the men finally made a decision. Terrified of cannibals  they decided to forgo the closest islands and instead embarked on the longer and much more difficult route to South America. After more than two months at sea  the men ran out of food as they knew they might  and they were still quite far from land. When the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships  less than half of the men were left alive  and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism. Herman Melville  who used this story as research for  Moby Dick   wrote years later  and from dry land  quote   All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex might in all human probability have been avoided had they  immediately after leaving the wreck  steered straight for Tahiti. But   as Melville put it   they dreaded cannibals.  So the question is  why did these men dread cannibals so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation  Why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other  Looked at from this angle  theirs becomes a story about reading. The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temperaments  the artistic and the scientific. A good reader has an artist's passion  a willingness to get caught up in the story  but just as importantly  the readers also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist  which acts to temper and complicate the reader's intuitive reactions to the story. As we've seen  the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part. They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios. The problem was that they listened to the wrong story. Of all the narratives their fears wrote  they responded only to the most lurid  the most vivid  the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture  cannibals. But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears more like a scientist  with more coolness of judgment  they would have listened instead to the less violent but the more likely tale  the story of starvation  and headed for Tahiti  just as Melville's sad commentary suggests. And maybe if we all tried to read our fears  we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them. Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about serial killers and plane crashes  and more time concerned with the subtler and slower disasters we face  the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries  the gradual changes in our climate. Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest  so too might our subtlest fears be the truest. Read in the right way  our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination  a kind of everyday clairvoyance  a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there's still time to influence how that future will play out. Properly read  our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature  a little wisdom  a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing    the truth. Thank you.  Applause  So I'd like to start by focusing on the world's most dangerous animal. Now  when you talk about dangerous animals  most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks. But of course the most dangerous animal is the mosquito. The mosquito has killed more humans than any other creature in human history. In fact  probably adding them all together  the mosquito has killed more humans. And the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague. And you would think  would you not  that with all our science  with all our advances in society  with better towns  better civilizations  better sanitation  wealth  that we would get better at controlling mosquitos  and hence reduce this disease. And that's not really the case. If it was the case  we wouldn't have between     and     million cases of malaria every year  and we wouldn't have a million and a half deaths from malaria  and we wouldn't have a disease that was relatively unknown    years ago now suddenly turned into the largest mosquito borne virus threat that we have  and that's called dengue fever. So    years ago  pretty much no one had heard of it  no one certainly in the European environment. But dengue fever now  according to the World Health Organization  infects between    and     million people every year  so that's equivalent to the whole of the population of the U.K. being infected every year. Other estimates put that number at roughly double that number of infections. And dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally. In the last    years  the incidence of dengue has grown thirtyfold. Now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is  for those who don't know. Now let's assume you go on holiday. Let's assume you go to the Caribbean  or you might go to Mexico. You might go to Latin America  Asia  Africa  anywhere in Saudi Arabia. You might go to India  the Far East. It doesn't really matter. It's the same mosquito  and it's the same disease. You're at risk. And let's assume you're bitten by a mosquito that's carrying that virus. Well  you could develop flu like symptoms. They could be quite mild. You could develop nausea  headache  your muscles could feel like they're contracting  and you could actually feel like your bones are breaking. And that's the nickname given to this disease. It's called breakbone fever  because that's how you can feel. Now the odd thing is  is that once you've been bitten by this mosquito  and you've had this disease  your body develops antibodies  so if you're bitten again with that strain  it doesn't affect you. But it's not one virus  it's four  and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three. So the next time you get dengue fever  if it's a different strain  you're more susceptible  you're likely to get worse symptoms  and you're more likely to get the more severe forms  hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. So you don't want dengue once  and you certainly don't want it again. So why is it spreading so fast  And the answer is this thing. This is Aedes aegypti. Now this is a mosquito that came  like its name suggests  out of North Africa  and it's spread round the world. Now  in fact  a single mosquito will only travel about     yards in its entire life. They don't travel very far. What they're very good at doing is hitchhiking  particularly the eggs. They will lay their eggs in clear water  any pool  any puddle  any birdbath  any flower pot  anywhere there's clear water  they'll lay their eggs  and if that clear water is near freight  it's near a port  if it's anywhere near transport  those eggs will then get transported around the world. And that's what's happened. Mankind has transported these eggs all the way around the world  and these insects have infested over     countries  and there's now  .  billion people living in countries where this mosquito resides. To give you just a couple of examples how fast this has happened  in the mid '  s  Brazil declared   We have no Aedes aegypti   and currently they spend about a billion dollars now a year trying to get rid of it  trying to control it  just one species of mosquito. Two days ago  or yesterday  I can't remember which  I saw a Reuters report that said Madeira had had their first cases of dengue  about    cases  with about     probable cases. That's two days ago. Interestingly  Madeira first got the insect in       and here we are  a few years later  first cases of dengue. So the one thing you'll find is that where the mosquito goes  dengue will follow. Once you've got the mosquito in your area  anyone coming into that area with dengue  mosquito will bite them  mosquito will bite somewhere else  somewhere else  somewhere else  and you'll get an epidemic. So we must be good at killing mosquitos. I mean  that can't be very difficult. Well  there's two principle ways. The first way is that you use larvicides. You use chemicals. You put them into water where they breed. Now in an urban environment  that's extraordinarily difficult. You've got to get your chemical into every puddle  every birdbath  every tree trunk. It's just not practical. The second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around. This is a picture of fogging. Here what someone is doing is mixing up chemical in a smoke and basically spreading that through the environment. You could do the same with a space spray. This is really unpleasant stuff  and if it was any good  we wouldn't have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever. So it's not very effective  but it's probably the best thing we've got at the moment. Having said that  actually  your best form of protection and my best form of protection is a long sleeve shirt and a little bit of DEET to go with it. So let's start again. Let's design a product  right from the word go  and decide what we want. Well we clearly need something that is effective at reducing the mosquito population. There's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there. We want something that gets that population right the way down so it can't get the disease transmission. Clearly the product you've got has got to be safe to humans. We are going to use it in and around humans. It has to be safe. We don't want to have a lasting impact on the environment. We don't want to do anything that you can't undo. Maybe a better product comes along in        years. Fine. We don't want a lasting environmental impact. We want something that's relatively cheap  or cost effective  because there's an awful lot of countries involved  and some of them are emerging markets  some of them emerging countries  low income. And finally  you want something that's species specific. You want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue  but you don't really want to get all the other insects. Some are quite beneficial. Some are important to your ecosystem. This one's not. It's invaded you. But you don't want to get all of the insects. You just want to get this one. And most of the time  you'll find this insect lives in and around your home  so this    whatever we do has got to get to that insect. It's got to get into people's houses  into the bedrooms  into the kitchens. Now there are two features of mosquito biology that really help us in this project  and that is  firstly  males don't bite. It's only the female mosquito that will actually bite you. The male can't bite you  won't bite you  doesn't have the mouth parts to bite you. It's just the female. And the second is a phenomenon that males are very  very good at finding females. If there's a male mosquito that you release  and if there's a female around  that male will find the female. So basically  we've used those two factors. So here's a typical situation  male meets female  lots of offspring. A single female will lay about up to     eggs at a time  up to about     in her lifetime. Now if that male is carrying a gene which causes the death of the offspring  then the offspring don't survive  and instead of having     mosquitos running around  you have none. And if you can put more  I'll call them sterile  that the offspring will actually die at different stages  but I'll call them sterile for now. If you put more sterile males out into the environment  then the females are more likely to find a sterile male than a fertile one  and you will bring that population down. So the males will go out  they'll look for females  they'll mate. If they mate successfully  then no offspring. If they don't find a female  then they'll die anyway. They only live a few days. And that's exactly where we are. So this is technology that was developed in Oxford University a few years ago. The company itself  Oxitec  we've been working for the last    years  very much on a sort of similar development pathway that you'd get with a pharmaceutical company. So about    years of internal evaluation  testing  to get this to a state where we think it's actually ready. And then we've gone out into the big outdoors  always with local community consent  always with the necessary permits. So we've done field trials now in the Cayman Islands  a small one in Malaysia  and two more now in Brazil. And what's the result  Well  the result has been very good. In about four months of release  we've brought that population of mosquitos   in most cases we're dealing with villages here of about              people  that sort of size  starting small   we've taken that mosquito population down by about    percent in about four months. And in fact  the numbers after that get  those get very difficult to count  because there just aren't any left. So that's been what we've seen in Cayman  it's been what we've seen in Brazil in those trials. And now what we're doing is we're going through a process to scale up to a town of about         so we can see this work at big scale. And we've got a production unit in Oxford  or just south of Oxford  where we actually produce these mosquitos. We can produce them  in a space a bit more than this red carpet  I can produce about    million a week. We can transport them around the world. It's not very expensive  because it's a coffee cup    something the size of a coffee cup will hold about three million eggs. So freight costs aren't our biggest problem.  Laughter  So we've got that. You could call it a mosquito factory. And for Brazil  where we've been doing some trials  the Brazilian government themselves have now built their own mosquito factory  far bigger than ours  and we'll use that for scaling up in Brazil. There you are. We've sent mosquito eggs. We've separated the males from the females. The males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go. It's actually a little bit more precise than that. You want to release them so that you get good coverage of your area. So you take a Google Map  you divide it up  work out how far they can fly  and make sure you're releasing such that you get coverage of the area  and then you go back  and within a very short space of time  you're bringing that population right the way down. We've also done this in agriculture. We've got several different species of agriculture coming along  and I'm hoping that soon we'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back and start looking at malaria. So that's where we stand at the moment  and I've just got a few final thoughts  which is that this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area  and these biological approaches are coming in in very different forms  and when you think about genetic engineering  we've now got enzymes for industrial processing  enzymes  genetically engineered enzymes in food. We have G.M. crops  we have pharmaceuticals  we have new vaccines  all using roughly the same technology  but with very different outcomes. And I'm in favor  actually. Of course I am. I'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies don't work well or have become unacceptable. And although the techniques are similar  the outcomes are very  very different  and if you take our approach  for example  and you compare it to  say  G.M. crops  both techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit. Both have a side benefit  which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously. But whereas a G.M. crop is trying to protect the plant  for example  and give it an advantage  what we're actually doing is taking the mosquito and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have  rendering it unable to reproduce effectively. So for the mosquito  it's a dead end. Thank you very much.  Applause  We live in an incredibly busy world. The pace of life is often frantic  our minds are always busy  and we're always doing something. So with that in mind  I'd like you just to take a moment to think  when did you last take any time to do nothing  Just    minutes  undisturbed  And when I say nothing  I do mean nothing. So that's no emailing  texting  no Internet  no TV  no chatting  no eating  no reading. Not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future. Simply doing nothing. I see a lot of very blank faces. You probably have to go a long way back. And this is an extraordinary thing  right  We're talking about our mind. The mind  our most valuable and precious resource  through which we experience every single moment of our life. The mind that we rely upon to be happy  content  emotionally stable as individuals  and at the same time  to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others. This is the same mind that we depend upon to be focused  creative  spontaneous  and to perform at our very best in everything that we do. And yet  we don't take any time out to look after it. In fact  we spend more time looking after our cars  our clothes and our hair than we    okay  maybe not our hair  but you see where I'm going. The result  of course  is that we get stressed. You know  the mind whizzes away like a washing machine going round and round  lots of difficult  confusing emotions  and we don't really know how to deal with that. And the sad fact is that we are so distracted that we're no longer present in the world in which we live. We miss out on the things that are most important to us  and the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes  that's the way life is  so we've just kind of got to get on with it. That's really not how it has to be. So I was about    when I went along to my first meditation class. And trust me  it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine  the sitting cross legged on the floor  the incense  the herbal tea  the vegetarians  the whole deal  but my mom was going and I was intrigued  so I went along with her. I'd also seen a few kung fu movies  and secretly I kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly  but I was very young at the time. Now as I was there  I guess  like a lot of people  I assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind. You get stressed  you do some meditation. I hadn't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature  until I was about     when a number of things happened in my life in quite quick succession  really serious things which just flipped my life upside down and all of a sudden I was inundated with thoughts  inundated with difficult emotions that I didn't know how to cope with. Every time I sort of pushed one down  another one would pop back up again. It was a really very stressful time. I guess we all deal with stress in different ways. Some people will bury themselves in work  grateful for the distraction. Others will turn to their friends  their family  looking for support. Some people hit the bottle  start taking medication. My own way of dealing with it was to become a monk. So I quit my degree  I headed off to the Himalayas  I became a monk  and I started studying meditation. People often ask me what I learned from that time. Well  obviously it changed things. Let's face it  becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things. But it was more than that. It taught me    it gave me a greater appreciation  an understanding for the present moment. By that I mean not being lost in thought  not being distracted  not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions  but instead learning how to be in the here and now  how to be mindful  how to be present. I think the present moment is so underrated. It sounds so ordinary  and yet we spend so little time in the present moment that it's anything but ordinary. There was a research paper that came out of Harvard  just recently  that said on average  our minds are lost in thought almost    percent of the time.    percent. At the same time  this sort of constant mind wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness. Now we're not here for that long anyway  but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought and potentially quite unhappy  I don't know  it just kind of seems tragic  actually  especially when there's something we can do about it  when there's a positive  practical  achievable  scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy  to be more mindful and less distracted. And the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about    minutes a day  it impacts our entire life. But we need to know how to do it. We need an exercise. We need a framework to learn how to be more mindful. That's essentially what meditation is. It's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment. But we also need to know how to approach it in the right way to get the best from it. And that's what these are for  in case you've been wondering  because most people assume that meditation is all about stopping thoughts  getting rid of emotions  somehow controlling the mind  but actually it's quite different from that. It's more about stepping back  sort of seeing the thought clearly  witnessing it coming and going  emotions coming and going without judgment  but with a relaxed  focused mind. So for example  right now  if I focus too much on the balls  then there's no way I can relax and talk to you at the same time. Equally  if I relax too much talking to you  there's no way I can focus on the balls. I'm going to drop them. Now in life  and in meditation  there'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense  and life starts to feel a bit like this. It's a very uncomfortable way to live life  when you get this tight and stressed. At other times  we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much  and things just become a sort of little bit like this. Of course in meditation    we're going to end up falling asleep. So we're looking for a balance  a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement. Now  what usually happens when we're learning to be mindful is that we get distracted by a thought. Let's say this is an anxious thought. Everything's going fine  and we see the anxious thought.  Oh  I didn't realize I was worried about that.  You go back to it  repeat it.  Oh  I am worried. I really am worried. Wow  there's so much anxiety.  And before we know it  right  we're anxious about feeling anxious. You know  this is crazy. We do this all the time  even on an everyday level. If you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth. You know it's wobbly  and you know that it hurts. But what do you do every        seconds  It does hurt. And we reinforce the storyline  right  And we just keep telling ourselves  and we do it all the time. And it's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind. But when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way  you might see many different patterns. You might find a mind that's really restless and    the whole time. Don't be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that. You might find a mind that's very dull and boring  and it's just  almost mechanical  it just seems it's as if you're getting up  going to work  eat  sleep  get up  work. Or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round your mind. Well  whatever it is  meditation offers the opportunity  the potential to step back and to get a different perspective  to see that things aren't always as they appear. We can't change every little thing that happens to us in life  but we can change the way that we experience it. That's the potential of meditation  of mindfulness. You don't have to burn any incense  and you definitely don't have to sit on the floor. All you need to do is to take    minutes out a day to step back  to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus  calm and clarity in your life. Thank you very much. The filmmaker Georges M li s was first a magician. Now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic. With complete control of everything the audience can see  moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques to further their deceptions. Motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life  produced by the sequential projection of still frames  and they astonished the Lumi re brothers' early audiences. Even today's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen  and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect. Now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over     years. Giambattista della Porta  a Neapolitan scholar in the   th century  examined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipulated. Playing with the world  and our perception of it  really is the essence of visual effects. So digging deeper into this with the Science and Technology Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reveals some truth behind the trickery. Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions  assumption  things are as we know them  presumption  things will behave as we expect  and context in reality  our knowledge of the world as we know it  such as scale. Now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession  which is  never betray the illusion. And that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection. So from the hand cranked jump cut early days of cinema to last Sunday's Oscar winner  what follows are some steps and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects. I hope you will enjoy.

So if you've been following the news  you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids headed for the United States  all scheduled to strike within the next    years. Now I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal. That actually wouldn't be such a problem  because if we were really all going to die  we would put aside our differences  we'd spend whatever it took  and we'd find a way to deflect them. I'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way  but they're wrapped in a special energy field that polarizes us  and therefore paralyzes us. Last March  I went to the TED conference  and I saw Jim Hansen speak  the NASA scientist who first raised the alarm about global warming in the     s  and it seems that the predictions he made back then are coming true. This is where we're headed in terms of global temperature rises  and if we keep on going the way we're going  we get a four  or five degree Centigrade temperature rise by the end of this century. Hansen says we can expect about a five meter rise in sea levels. This is what a five meter rise in sea levels would look like. Low lying cities all around the world will disappear within the lifetime of children born today. Hansen closed his talk by saying   Imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth. That is the equivalent of what we face now. Yet we dither  taking no action to deflect the asteroid  even though the longer we wait  the more difficult and expensive it becomes.  Of course  the left wants to take action  but the right denies that there's any problem. All right  so I go back from TED  and then the following week  I'm invited to a dinner party in Washington  D.C.  where I know that I'll be meeting a number of conservative intellectuals  including Yuval Levin  and to prepare for the meeting  I read this article by Levin in National Affairs called  Beyond the Welfare State.  Levin writes that all over the world  nations are coming to terms with the fact that the social democratic welfare state is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable  dependent upon dubious economics and the demographic model of a bygone era. All right  now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid  but look at these graphs that Levin showed. This graph shows the national debt as a percentage of America's GDP  and as you see  if you go all the way back to the founding  we borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War. Wars are expensive. But then we'd pay it off  pay it off  pay it off  and then  oh  what's this  The Civil War. Even more expensive. Borrow a lot of money  pay it off  pay it off  pay it off  get down to near zero  and bang     World War I. Once again  the same process repeats. Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II. We rise to an astronomical level  around     percent of GDP  really unsustainable  really dangerous. But we pay it off  pay it off  pay it off  and then  what's this  Why has it been rising since the '  s  It's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded  but it's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending  especially Medicare. We're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II  and the baby boomers haven't even retired yet  and when they do  this is what will happen. This is data from the Congressional Budget Office showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended. All right  now what you might notice is that these two graphs are actually identical  not in terms of the x  and y axes  or in terms of the data they present  but in terms of their moral and political implications  they say the same thing. Let me translate for you.  We are doomed unless we start acting now. What's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party  Can't you see reality  If you won't help  then get the hell out of the way.  We can deflect both of these asteroids. These problems are both technically solvable. Our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper partisan times  the mere fact that one side says   Look  there's an asteroid   means that the other side's going to say   Huh  What  No  I'm not even going to look up. No.  To understand why this is happening to us  and what we can do about it  we need to learn more about moral psychology. So I'm a social psychologist  and I study morality  and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds. It binds us into teams that circle around sacred values but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality. Think of it like this. Large scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet. There are only a few species that can do it. That's a beehive. That's a termite mound  a giant termite mound. And when you find this in other animals  it's always the same story. They're always all siblings who are children of a single queen  so they're all in the same boat. They rise or fall  they live or die  as one. There's only one species on the planet that can do this without kinship  and that  of course  is us. This is a reconstruction of ancient Babylon  and this is Tenochtitlan. Now how did we do this  How did we go from being hunter gatherers        years ago to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years  It's miraculous  and part of the explanation is this ability to circle around sacred values. As you see  temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations. This is an image of Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca. It's a sacred rock  and when people circle something together  they unite  they can trust each other  they become one. It's as though you're moving an electrical wire through a magnetic field that generates current. When people circle together  they generate a current. We love to circle around things. We circle around flags  and then we can trust each other. We can fight as a team  as a unit. But even as morality binds people together into a unit  into a team  the circling blinds them. It causes them to distort reality. We begin separating everything into good versus evil. Now that process feels great. It feels really satisfying. But it is a gross distortion of reality. You can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress. This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting in Congress falls strictly along the left right axis  so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is  you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues. And what you can see is that  in the decades after the Civil War  Congress was extraordinarily polarized  as you would expect  about as high as can be. But then  after World War I  things dropped  and we get this historically low level of polarization. This was a golden age of bipartisanship  at least in terms of the parties' ability to work together and solve grand national problems. But in the     s and '  s  the electromagnet turns back on. Polarization rises. It used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in Congress. They could rearrange themselves  form bipartisan committees  but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up  the force field increased  Democrats and Republicans were pulled apart. It became much harder for them to socialize  much harder for them to cooperate. Retiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare. Did anybody notice that in two of the three debates  Obama wore a blue tie and Romney wore a red tie  Do you know why they do this  It's so that the Bloods and the Crips will know which side to vote for.  Laughter  The polarization is strongest among our political elites. Nobody doubts that this is happening in Washington. But for a while  there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people. Well  in the last    years it's become much more apparent that it is. So look at this data. This is from the American National Elections Survey. And what they do on that survey is they ask what's called a feeling thermometer rating. So  how warm or cold do you feel about  you know  Native Americans  or the military  the Republican Party  the Democratic Party  all sorts of groups in American life. The blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel about Democrats  and they like them. You know  ratings in the   s on a     point scale. Republicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise. But when you look at cross party ratings  you find  well  that it's lower  but actually  when I first saw this data  I was surprised. That's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations  they were rating the other party       . It's not terrible. It drifts downwards very slightly  but now look what happens under George W. Bush and Obama. It plummets. Something is going on here. The moral electromagnet is turning back on  and nowadays  just very recently  Democrats really dislike Republicans. Republicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing. It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too. It's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart  pulling left and right into their own territories like the Bloods and the Crips. Now  there are many reasons why this is happening to us  and many of them we cannot reverse. We will never again have a political class that was forged by the experience of fighting together in World War II against a common enemy. We will never again have just three television networks  all of which are relatively centrist. And we will never again have a large group of conservative southern Democrats and liberal northern Republicans making it easy  making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation. So for a lot of reasons  those decades after the Second World War were an historically anomalous time. We will never get back to those low levels of polarization  I believe. But there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better  because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly to things that Congress did to itself in the     s that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution. These changes are detailed in many books. These are two that I strongly recommend  and they list a whole bunch of reforms. I'm just going to group them into three broad classes here. So if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional  hyper polarized institution  well  the first step is  do what you can so that fewer hyper partisans get elected in the first place  and when you have closed party primaries  and only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting  you're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper partisans. So open primaries would make that problem much  much less severe. But the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress. From my experience  and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders  most of the people going to Congress are good  hard working  intelligent people who really want to solve problems  but once they get there  they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper partisanship and that punishes independent thinking. You step out of line  you get punished. So there are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this. For example  this  Citizens United  ruling is a disaster  because it means there's like a money gun aimed at your head  and if you step out of line  if you try to reach across the aisle  there's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising. But the third class of reforms is that we've got to change the nature of social relationships in Congress. The politicians I've met are generally very extroverted  friendly  very socially skillful people  and that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships  make deals  you've got to cajole  please  flatter  you've got to use your personal skills  and that's the way politics has always worked. But beginning in the     s  first the House of Representatives changed its legislative calendar so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week. Nowadays  Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning  they do battle for two days  then they fly home Thursday afternoon. They don't move their families to the District. They don't meet each other's spouses or children. There's no more relationship there. And trying to run Congress without human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil. Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up and descends into paralysis and polarization  A simple change to the legislative calendar  such as having business stretch out for three weeks and then they get a week off to go home  that would change the fundamental relationships in Congress. So there's a lot we can do  but who's going to push them to do it  There are a number of groups that are working on this. No Labels and Common Cause  I think  have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective. But I'd like to supplement their work with a little psychological trick  and the trick is this. Nothing pulls people together like a common threat or a common attack  especially an attack from a foreign enemy  unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology  in which case  as I said before  it can actually pull us apart. Sometimes a single threat can polarize us  as we saw. But what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this  where there's just so much stuff coming in  it's just   Start shooting  come on  everybody  we've got to just work together  just start shooting.  Because actually  we do face this situation. This is where we are as a country. So here's another asteroid. We've all seen versions of this graph  right  which shows the changes in wealth since       and as you can see  almost all the gains in wealth have gone to the top    percent  and especially the top one percent. Rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy. Especially  it destroys our ability to trust each other  to feel that we're all in the same boat  because it's obvious we're not. Some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts. Other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood. We're not all in the same boat  and that means nobody's willing to sacrifice for the common good. The left has been screaming about this asteroid for    years now  and the right says   Huh  what  Hmm  No problem. No problem.  Now  why is that happening to us  Why is the inequality rising  Well  one of the largest causes  after globalization  is actually this fourth asteroid  rising non marital births. This graph shows the steady rise of out of wedlock births since the     s. Most Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers. Whites are headed that way too. Within a decade or two  most American children will be born into homes with no father. This means that there's much less money coming into the house. But it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos. As I know from working with street children in Brazil  Mom's boyfriend is often a really  really dangerous person for kids. Now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the     s  and the left has been saying   It's not a problem. It's not a problem.  The left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children. Now let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here. I'm actually more critical of the men who won't take responsibility for their own children and of an economic system that makes it difficult for many men to earn enough money to support those children. But even if you blame nobody  it still is a national problem  and one side has been more concerned about it than the other. The New York Times finally noticed this asteroid with a front page story last July showing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality. We are becoming a nation of just two classes. When Americans go to college and marry each other  they have very low divorce rates. They earn a lot of money  they invest that money in their kids  some of them become tiger mothers  the kids rise to their full potential  and the kids go on to become the top two lines in this graph. And then there's everybody else  the children who don't benefit from a stable marriage  who don't have as much invested in them  who don't grow up in a stable environment  and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph. So once again  we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing. As before  we've got a problem  we've got to start working on this  we've got to do something  and what's wrong with you people that you don't see my threat  But if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders  we'd see that these two problems actually are best addressed together. Because if you really care about income inequality  you might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups that are working on ways to promote marriage. But then you're going to run smack into the problem that women don't generally want to marry someone who doesn't have a job. So if you really care about strengthening families  you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality  who are working on raising the minimum wage  who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives. So to conclude  there are at least four asteroids headed our way. How many of you can see all four  Please raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit that all four of these are national problems. Please raise your hands. Okay  almost all of you. Well  congratulations  you guys are the inaugural members of the Asteroids Club  which is a club for all Americans who are willing to admit that the other side actually might have a point. In the Asteroids Club  we don't start by looking for common ground. Common ground is often very hard to find. No  we start by looking for common threats because common threats make common ground. Now  am I being naive  Is it naive to think that people could ever lay down their swords  and left and right could actually work together  I don't think so  because it happens  not all that often  but there are a variety of examples that point the way. This is something we can do. Because Americans on both sides care about the decline in civility  and they've formed dozens of organizations  at the national level  such as this one  down to many local organizations  such as To The Village Square in Tallahassee  Florida  which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate that sort of working together human relationship that's necessary to solve Florida's problems. Americans on both sides care about global poverty and AIDS  and on so many humanitarian issues  liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies  and at times they really have worked together to solve these problems. And most surprisingly to me  they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice. For example  the incarceration rate  the prison population in this country has quadrupled since     . Now this is a social disaster  and liberals are very concerned about this. The Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting the prison industrial complex  fighting to prevent a system that's just sucking in more and more poor young men. But are conservatives happy about this  Well  Grover Norquist isn't  because this system costs an unbelievable amount of money. And so  because the prison industrial complex is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls  groups of fiscal conservatives and Christian conservatives have come together to form a group called Right on Crime. And at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center to oppose the building of new prisons and to work for reforms that will make the justice system more efficient and more humane. So this is possible. We can do it. Let us therefore go to battle stations  not to fight each other  but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids. And let our first mission be to press Congress to reform itself  before it's too late for our nation. Thank you.  Applause  It's wonderful to be here to talk about my journey  to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me. I started using a wheelchair    years ago when an extended illness changed the way I could access the world. When I started using the wheelchair  it was a tremendous new freedom. I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted. It was like having an enormous new toy. I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again. Just being out on the street was exhilarating. But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom  people's reaction completely changed towards me. It was as if they couldn't see me anymore  as if an invisibility cloak had descended. They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair. When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair  they used words like  limitation    fear    pity  and  restriction.  I realized I'd internalized these responses and it had changed who I was on a core level. A part of me had become alienated from myself. I was seeing myself not from my perspective  but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people's responses to me. As a result  I knew I needed to make my own stories about this experience  new narratives to reclaim my identity.   Finding Freedom  'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.'   Davis       TEDx Women   I started making work that aimed to communicate something of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair    a power chair    to negotiate the world. I was working to transform these internalized responses  to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped my identity when I started using a wheelchair  by creating unexpected images. The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with. When I literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom  it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people. It seemed to open up new perspectives  and therein lay the paradigm shift. It showed that an arts practice can remake one's identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar. So when I began to dive  in       I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does  but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure  completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair. So I thought   I wonder what'll happen if I put the two together    Laughter   Applause  And the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years. So to give you an idea of what that's like  I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle  and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on. It is the most amazing experience  beyond most other things I've experienced in life. I literally have the freedom to move in     degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom. And the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too. Their eyes literally light up  and they say things like   I want one of those   or   If you can do that  I can do anything.  And I'm thinking  it's because in that moment of them seeing an object they have no frame of reference for  or so transcends the frames of reference they have with the wheelchair  they have to think in a completely new way. And I think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people's lives. For me  this means that they're seeing the value of difference  the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation  we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives. For me  the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation. In fact  I now call the underwater wheelchair  Portal   because it's literally pushed me through into a new way of being  into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness. And the other thing is  that because nobody's seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before  and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing  being and knowing  now you have this concept in your mind. You're all part of the artwork too. Hello. My name is Jarrett Krosoczka  and I write and illustrate books for children for a living. So I use my imagination as my full time job. But well before my imagination was my vocation  my imagination saved my life. When I was a kid  I loved to draw  and the most talented artist I knew was my mother  but my mother was addicted to heroin. And when your parent is a drug addict  it's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football  because as much as you want to love on that person  as much as you want to receive love from that person  every time you open your heart  you end up on your back. So throughout my childhood  my mother was incarcerated and I didn't have my father because I didn't even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade. But I had my grandparents  my maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley  who adopted me just before my third birthday and took me in as their own  after they had already raised five children. So two people who grew up in the Great Depression  there in the very  very early '  s took on a new kid. I was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom of the Krosoczka family  the new kid who came out of nowhere. And I would like to say that life was totally easy with them. They each smoked two packs a day  each  nonfiltered  and by the time I was six  I could order a Southern Comfort Manhattan  dry with a twist  rocks on the side  the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink. But they loved the hell out of me. They loved me so much. And they supported my creative efforts  because my grandfather was a self made man. He ran and worked in a factory. My grandmother was a homemaker. But here was this kid who loved Transformers and Snoopy and the Ninja Turtles  and the characters that I read about  I fell in love with  and they became my friends. So my best friends in life were the characters I read about in books. I went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester  Massachusetts  and I had wonderful teachers there  most notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch. And I just  I can just remember the love that she offered us as her students. When I was in the third grade  a monumental event happened. An author visited our school  Jack Gantos. A published author of books came to talk to us about what he did for a living. And afterwards  we all went back to our classrooms and we drew our own renditions of his main character  Rotten Ralph. And suddenly the author appeared in our doorway  and I remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles  going from kid to kid looking at the desks  not saying a word. But he stopped next to my desk  and he tapped on my desk  and he said   Nice cat.   Laughter  And he wandered away. Two words that made a colossal difference in my life. When I was in the third grade  I wrote a book for the first time   The Owl Who Thought He Was The Best Flyer.   Laughter  We had to write our own Greek myth  our own creation story  so I wrote a story about an owl who challenged Hermes to a flying race  and the owl cheated  and Hermes  being a Greek god  grew angry and bitter  and turned the owl into a moon  so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon while he watched his family and friends play at night. Yeah.  Laughter  My book had a title page. I was clearly worried about my intellectual property when I was eight. And it was a story that was told with words and pictures  exactly what I do now for a living  and I sometimes let the words have the stage on their own  and sometimes I allowed the pictures to work on their own to tell the story. My favorite page is the  About the author  page. So I learned to write about myself in third person at a young age. So I love that last sentence   He liked making this book.  And I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination  and that's what writing is. Writing is using your imagination on paper  and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids  that writing would be using your imagination on paper  if they're allowed to even write now within the school hours. So I loved writing so much that I'd come home from school  and I would take out pieces of paper  and I would staple them together  and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because I loved using my imagination. And so these characters would become my friends. There was an egg  a tomato  a head of lettuce and a pumpkin  and they all lived in this refrigerator city  and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender who tried to chop them up  an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple  and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend who was a stick of butter.  Laughter  And I'd make my own comics too  and this was another way for me to tell stories  through words and through pictures. Now when I was in sixth grade  the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets in the Worcester public school system. I went from having art once a week to twice a month to once a month to not at all. And my grandfather  he was a wise man  and he saw that as a problem  because he knew that was  like  the one thing I had. I didn't play sports. I had art. So he walked into my room one evening  and he sat on the edge of my bed  and he said   Jarrett  it's up to you  but if you'd like to  we'd like to send you to the classes at the Worcester Art Museum.  And I was so thrilled. So from sixth through   th grade  once  twice  sometimes three times a week  I would take classes at the art museum  and I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw  other kids who shared a similar passion. Now my publishing career began when I designed the cover for my eighth grade yearbook  and if you're wondering about the style of dress I put our mascot in  I was really into Bell Biv DeVoe and MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice at the time.  Laughter  And to this day  I still can do karaoke to  Ice  Ice Baby  without looking at the screen. Don't tempt me  because I will do it. So I get shipped off to private school  K through eight  public schools  but for some reason my grandfather was upset that somebody at the local high school had been stabbed and killed  so he didn't want me to go there. He wanted me to go to a private school  and he gave me an option. You can go to Holy Name  which is coed  or St. John's  which is all boys. Very wise man  because he knew I would  I felt like I was making the decision on my own  and he knew I wouldn't choose St. John's  so I went to Holy Name High School  which was a tough transition because  like I said  I didn't play sports  and it was very focused on sports  but I took solace in Mr. Shilale's art room. And I just flourished here. I just couldn't wait to get to that classroom every day. So how did I make friends  I drew funny pictures of my teachers     Laughter     and I passed them around. Well  in English class  in ninth grade  my friend John  who was sitting next to me  laughed a little bit too hard. Mr. Greenwood was not pleased. He instantly saw that I was the cause of the commotion  and for the first time in my life  I was sent to the hall  and I thought   Oh no  I'm doomed. My grandfather's just going to kill me.  And he came out to the hallway and he said   Let me see the paper.  And I thought   Oh no. He thinks it's a note.  And so I took this picture  and I handed it to him. And we sat in silence for that brief moment  and he said to me   You're really talented.   Laughter   You're really good. You know  the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist  and you should be the cartoonist. Just stop drawing in my class.  So my parents never found out about it. I didn't get in trouble. I was introduced to Mrs. Casey  who ran the school newspaper  and I was for three and a half years the cartoonist for my school paper  handling such heavy issues as  seniors are mean  freshmen are nerds  the prom bill is so expensive. I can't believe how much it costs to go to the prom. And I took the headmaster to task and then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley who was unlucky in love  and I just swore up and down that this wasn't about me  but all these years later it was totally me. But it was so cool because I could write these stories  I could come up with these ideas  and they'd be published in the school paper  and people who I didn't know could read them. And I loved that thought  of being able to share my ideas through the printed page. On my   th birthday  my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever  a drafting table that I have worked on ever since. Here I am     years later  and I still work on this table every day. On the evening of my   th birthday  I was given this table  and we had Chinese food. And this was my fortune   You will be successful in your work.  I taped it to the top left hand of my table  and as you can see  it's still there. Now I never really asked my grandparents for anything. Well  two things  Rusty  who was a great hamster and lived a great long life when I was in fourth grade. And a video camera. I just wanted a video camera. And after begging and pleading for Christmas  I got a second hand video camera  and I instantly started making my own animations on my own  and all throughout high school I made my own animations. I convinced my   th grade English teacher to allow me to do my book report on Stephen King's  Misery  as an animated short.  Laughter  And I kept making comics. I kept making comics  and at the Worcester Art Museum  I was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given. Mark Lynch  he's an amazing teacher and he's still a dear friend of mine  and I was    or     and I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course  and I was so excited  I was beaming. I had this book that was how to draw comics in the Marvel way  and it taught me how to draw superheroes  how to draw a woman  how to draw muscles just the way they were supposed to be if I were to ever draw for X Men or Spiderman. And all the color just drained from his face  and he looked at me  and he said   Forget everything you learned.  And I didn't understand. He said   You have a great style. Celebrate your own style. Don't draw the way you're being told to draw. Draw the way you're drawing and keep at it  because you're really good.  Now when I was a teenager  I was angsty as any teenager was  but after    years of having a mother who was in and out of my life like a yo yo and a father who was faceless  I was angry. And when I was     I met my father for the first time  upon which I learned I had a brother and sister I had never known about. And on the day I met my father for the first time  I was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design  my one and only choice for college. But it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids  kids with leukemia  and this kid Eric changed my life. Eric didn't live to see his sixth birthday  and Eric lives with me every day. So after this experience  my art teacher  Mr. Shilale  he brought in these picture books  and I thought   Picture books for kids   and I started writing books for young readers when I was a senior in high school. Well  I eventually got to the Rhode Island School of Design. I transferred to RISD as a sophomore  and it was there that I took every course that I could on writing  and it was there that I wrote a story about a giant orange slug who wanted to be friends with this kid. The kid had no patience for him. And I sent this book out to a dozen publishers and it was rejected every single time  but I was also involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp  an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses  and it's those kids at the camp that read my stories  and I read to them  and I saw that they responded to my work. I graduated from RISD. My grandparents were very proud  and I moved to Boston  and I set up shop. I set up a studio and I tried to get published. I would send out my books. I would send out hundreds of postcards to editors and art directors  but they would go unanswered. And my grandfather would call me every week  and he would say   Jarrett  how's it going  Do you have a job yet   Because he had just invested a significant amount of money in my college education. And I said   Yes  I have a job. I write and illustrate children's books.  And he said   Well  who pays you for that   And I said   No one  no one  no one just yet. But I know it's going to happen.  Now  I used to work the weekends at the Hole in the Wall off season programming to make some extra money as I was trying to get my feet off the ground  and this kid who was just this really hyper kid  I started calling him  Monkey Boy   and I went home and wrote a book called  Good Night  Monkey Boy.  And I sent out one last batch of postcards. And I received an email from an editor at Random House with a subject line   Nice work   Exclamation point.  Dear Jarrett  I received your postcard. I liked your art  so I went to your website and I'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories  because I really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them. Please let me know if you're ever in New York City.  And this was from an editor at Random House Children's Books. So the next week I  happened  to be in New York. And I met with this editor  and I left New York for a contract for my first book   Good Night  Monkey Boy   which was published on June         . And my local paper celebrated the news. The local bookstore made a big deal of it. They sold out of all of their books. My friend described it as a wake  but happy  because everyone I ever knew was there in line to see me  but I wasn't dead. I was just signing books. My grandparents  they were in the middle of it. They were so happy. They couldn't have been more proud. Mrs. Alisch was there. Mr. Shilale was there. Mrs. Casey was there. Mrs. Alisch cut in front of the line and said   I taught him how to read.   Laughter  And then something happened that changed my life. I got my first piece of significant fan mail  where this kid loved Monkey Boy so much that he wanted to have a Monkey Boy birthday cake. For a two year old  that is like a tattoo.  Laughter  You know  You only get one birthday per year. And for him  it's only his second. And I got this picture  and I thought   This picture is going to live within his consciousness for his entire life. He will forever have this photo in his family photo albums.  So that photo  since that moment  is framed in front of me while I've worked on all of my books. I have    picture books out.  Punk Farm    Baghead    Ollie the Purple Elephant.  I just finished the ninth book in the  Lunch Lady  series  which is a graphic novel series about a lunch lady who fights crime. I'm expecting the release of a chapter book called  Platypus Police Squad  The Frog Who Croaked.  And I travel the country visiting countless schools  letting lots of kids know that they draw great cats. And I meet Bagheads. Lunch ladies treat me really well. And I got to see my name in lights because kids put my name in lights. Twice now  the  Lunch Lady  series has won the Children's Choice Book of the Year in the third or fourth grade category  and those winners were displayed on a jumbotron screen in Times Square.  Punk Farm  and  Lunch Lady  are in development to be movies  so I am a movie producer and I really do think  thanks to that video camera I was given in ninth grade. I've seen people have  Punk Farm  birthday parties  people have dressed up as  Punk Farm  for Halloween  a  Punk Farm  baby room  which makes me a little nervous for the child's well being in the long term. And I get the most amazing fan mail  and I get the most amazing projects  and the biggest moment for me came last Halloween. The doorbell rang and it was a trick or treater dressed as my character. It was so cool. Now my grandparents are no longer living  so to honor them  I started a scholarship at the Worcester Art Museum for kids who are in difficult situations but whose caretakers can't afford the classes. And it displayed the work from my first    years of publishing  and you know who was there to celebrate  Mrs. Alisch. I said   Mrs. Alisch  how are you   And she responded with   I'm here.   Laughter  That's true. You are alive  and that's pretty good right now. So the biggest moment for me  though  my most important job now is I am a dad myself  and I have two beautiful daughters  and my goal is to surround them by inspiration  by the books that are in every single room of our house to the murals I painted in their rooms to the moments for creativity where you find  in quiet times  by making faces on the patio to letting her sit in the very desk that I've sat in for the past    years. Thank you.  Applause  I'd like to share with you the story of one of my patients called Celine. Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of Cameroon in west Central Africa. Six years ago  at the time of her HIV diagnosis  she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time. When I first met Celine  a little over a year ago  she had gone for    months without any antiretroviral therapy  and she was very ill. She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the    kilometer distance. Now during the clinical trial  she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge  and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds. All of these ended once the trial was completed  leaving Celine with no alternatives. She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she'd received during the trial  or even what the trial had been about. I didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue. Yet what puzzled me most was Celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial  yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed. Now  I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted. Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results. Maybe it even got published in a high profile scientific journal. Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients. But it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who  like Celine  were left to their own devices once the research had been completed. I do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting HIV clinical trials in developing countries is bad. On the contrary  clinical trials are extremely useful tools  and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries. However  the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation  especially in the context of externally funded research. Sadly enough  the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research. I'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries  especially those in sub Saharan Africa  so attractive for these HIV clinical trials  Well  in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results  they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new HIV infections. Sub Saharan Africa largely fits this description  with    million people living with HIV  an estimated    percent of the    million people who are infected worldwide. Also  research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty  endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems. A clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized  and in the absence of good health care systems  almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing. Even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation  less rigorous ethical reviews  and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure. As funding for HIV research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict  you can see why this context becomes very  very attractive. The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable. How then can we ensure that  in our search for the cure  we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic  I invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which things are done. The first of these is informed consent. Now  in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable  participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand  and must freely consent to participate in the trial. This is especially important in developing countries  where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits. Consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries. For example  it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant  like Celine  sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read  let alone understand. Local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials  as well as the incentives for participation. The information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats. The second point I would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial. Now  this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy. Should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available anywhere in the world  Or should they be given an alternative standard of care  such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted  Is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed  Now  in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver  the answer is straightforward. However  the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries. It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial  and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study. That brings us to the third point I want you think about  the ethical review of research. An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial. Unfortunately  this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries. Local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries  and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors. Public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate. The final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed. I think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended. Now  researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed. In addition  they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends. If  for any reason  they feel that this might not be possible  then I think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place. Now  fortunately for Celine  our meeting did not end in my office. I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program closer to her home  and with a support group to help her cope. Her story has a positive ending  but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate. Although she may not know this  my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries  and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done. I believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change. If you are a researcher  I hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience  to remain ethical in your research  and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers. If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company  I challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound. If you come from a developing country like myself  I urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country. Yes  there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV  to find an effective vaccine for malaria  to find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B.  but I believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way. Thank you. I was sitting with my girls  and Joy said   Dang  I wish he'd get off my back. My daddy  he calls me all the time.   Lucky for you he calls at all   said Jasmine.  I haven't heard from my dad in years.  At this moment  I knew the girls needed a way to connect with their fathers. At Camp Diva  my non profit organization  we have these types of conversations all the time as a way to help girls of African descent prepare for their passage into womanhood. These girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms. So I asked the girls   How can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers    Let's have a dance   one girl shouted  and all the girls quickly backed her up. They started dreaming about the decorations  invitations  the dresses they were going to wear  and what their fathers could and could not wear.  Laughter  It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes  but even if I could have slowed down those girls  I wouldn't have  because one thing that I have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need. The wisdom lives inside of them. As long as they have infrastructure  mentorship and resources  they can build what they need  not only to survive  but to thrive. So we had a dance  and girls and their fathers came in multitudes. They were dressed to the nines. They acted sweet. They acted silly. They really enjoyed each other's company. It was a huge success. And the girls decided to make it an annual event. So as the seasons changed  and it was time to plan the dance again  one girl named Brianna spoke up  and she said   My dad can't come to the dance  and this whole thing is making me sad.   Why not   the girls asked.  Because he's in jail   she bravely admitted.  Well  can he just get out for a day   one of the girls asked.  Laughter   And come in shackles  That's worse than not having him here at all.  At this moment  I saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes. So I asked   What do you think we should do about this  We want every girl to experience the dance  right   So the girls thought for a moment  and one girl suggested   Why don't we just take the dance in the jail   Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that  and said   Are you crazy  Who is going to allow a bunch of little girls  dressed up      Laughter      to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits   Because that's what they called them. I said   Girls  well  well  you never know unless you ask.  So a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff  signed collectively by each girl  and I would have to say  he is a very special sheriff. He contacted me immediately and said  whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside  his doors are always open. Because one thing he did know  that when fathers are connected to their children  it is less likely that they will return. So     inmates and    girls were invited. The girls were dressed in their Sunday best  and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties. They hugged. They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish. They laughed together. It was beautiful. The fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection  something that a lot of them didn't even have for a while. Fathers were in a space where they were able to make their daughters play  and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance. Even the guards cried. But after the dance  we all realized that Dad still would be in jail. So we needed to create something that they could take with them. So we brought in Flip cams  and we had them look at the Flip cams and just interview each other    their messages  their thoughts. This was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected  they could reconnect through this image. I'll never forget that one girl looked in her father's eyes with that camera and said   Daddy  when you look at me  what do you see   Because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve  and how they see us for the rest of our lives. I know that very well  because I was one of the lucky girls. I have had my father in my life always. He's even here today. And that is why it is extremely special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers  especially those who are separated because of barbed wires and metal doors. We have just created a form for girls who have heavy questions on their heart to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions and given the fathers the freedom to answer. Because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought  What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world  Because a father is locked in does not mean he should be locked out of his daughter's life. It's a great time to be a molecular biologist.  Laughter  Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper. By the end of this year  we'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than       euros. Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest growing technology sector. It has the power  potentially  to replace our fossil fuels  to revolutionize medicine  and to touch every aspect of our daily lives. So who gets to do it  I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it. But what about that guy   Laughter  In       I first heard about DIYbio. It's a movement that    it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone  not just scientists and people in government labs. The idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate  it could really stimulate innovation. Putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea of what their needs are. And here's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road  all these associated social  moral  ethical questions  and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs. So wouldn't it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff  do it hands on  I thought so. So  three years ago  I got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded Genspace. It's a nonprofit  a community biotech lab in Brooklyn  New York  and the idea was people could come  they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open  friendly atmosphere. None of my previous experience prepared me for what came next. Can you guess  The press started calling us. And the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy  the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next Frankenstein  and as a result  for the next six months  when you Googled my name  instead of getting my scientific papers  you got this.   Am I a biohazard    It was pretty depressing. The only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world  there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were. They were opening biohacker spaces  and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did  more regulations  less resources. But now  three years later  here's where we stand. It's a vibrant  global community of hackerspaces  and this is just the beginning. These are some of the biggest ones  and there are others opening every day. There's one probably going to open up in Moscow  one in South Korea  and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of. Let me take you on a little tour. Biohackers work alone. We work in groups  in big cities    Laughter    and in small villages. We reverse engineer lab equipment. We genetically engineer bacteria. We hack hardware  software  wetware  and  of course  the code of life. We like to build things. Then we like to take things apart. We make things grow. We make things glow. And we make cells dance. The spirit of these labs  it's open  it's positive  but  you know  sometimes when people think of us  the first thing that comes to mind is bio safety  bio security  all the dark side stuff. I'm not going to minimize those concerns. Any powerful technology is inherently dual use  and  you know  you get something like synthetic biology  nanobiotechnology  it really compels you  you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups  because they have better infrastructure  they have better facilities  and they have access to pathogens. So the United Nations did just that  and they recently issued a report on this whole area  and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative  and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community  and they noted  not surprisingly  that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics. As a matter of fact  DIY people from all over the world  America  Europe  got together last year  and we hammered out a common code of ethics. That's a lot more than conventional science has done. Now  we follow state and local regulations. We dispose of our waste properly  we follow safety procedures  we don't work with pathogens. You know  if you're working with a pathogen  you're not part of the biohacker community  you're part of the bioterrorist community  I'm sorry. And sometimes people ask me   Well  what about an accident   Well  working with the safe organisms that we normally work with  the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating  like  some sort of superbug  that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Now  it could happen  but I'm not going to plan my life around it. I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk. I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project. It's a study at Harvard where  at the end of the study  they're going to take my entire genomic sequence  all of my medical information  and my identity  and they're going to post it online for everyone to see. There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion. The one I liked the best is  someone could download my sequence  go back to the lab  synthesize some fake Ellen DNA  and plant it at a crime scene.  Laughter  But like DIYbio  the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk. Now  you might be asking yourself   Well  you know  what would I do in a biolab   Well  it wasn't that long ago we were asking   Well  what would anyone do with a personal computer   So this stuff is just beginning. We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg. Let me show you what you could do right now. A biohacker in Germany  a journalist  wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street  Yep  you guessed it. He threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs  analyzed the saliva  identified the dog  and confronted the dog owner. I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard. Looked like a ladybug  right  It actually is a Japanese beetle. And the same kind of technology    it's called DNA barcoding  it's really cool    You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga  if that sushi is really tuna  or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat's. In a biohacker space  you can analyze your genome for mutations. You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's  and you can explore your ancestry. You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere  collect microbes  see what's up there. You can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water. You can make some sort of a biofuel cell. You can do a lot of things. You can also do an art science project. Some of these are really spectacular  and they look at social  ecological problems from a completely different perspective. It's really cool. Some people ask me  well  why am I involved  I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science. The thing is  there's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can't find anywhere else. There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project  and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money  that it's going to save mankind  or even that it's feasible. It just has to follow safety guidelines. If you had spaces like this all over the world  it could really change the perception of who's allowed to do biotech. It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing. Why not personal biotech  If everyone in this room got involved  who knows what we could do  This is such a new area  and as we say back in Brooklyn  you ain't seen nothin' yet.  Laughter  Hi. My name is Cameron Russell  and for the last little while  I've been a model. Actually  for    years. And I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress. So luckily  I brought an outfit change. This is the first outfit change on the TED stage  so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it  I think. If some of the women were really horrified when I came out  you don't have to tell me now  but I'll find out later on Twitter. I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief    seconds. Not everybody gets to do that. These heels are very uncomfortable  so good thing I wasn't going to wear them. The worst part is putting this sweater over my head  because that's when you'll all laugh at me  so don't do anything while it's over my head. All right. So  why did I do that  That was awkward. Well    Hopefully not as awkward as that picture. Image is powerful  but also  image is superficial. I just totally transformed what you thought of me  in six seconds. And in this picture  I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life. I was totally uncomfortable  and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair. And of course  barring surgery  or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work  there's very little that we can do to transform how we look  and how we look  though it is superficial and immutable  has a huge impact on our lives. So today  for me  being fearless means being honest. And I am on this stage because I am a model. I am on this stage because I am a pretty  white woman  and in my industry  we call that a sexy girl. I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me  but with an honest twist. So the first question is  how do you become a model  I always just say   Oh  I was scouted   but that means nothing. The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery  and I am the recipient of a legacy  and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy. Well  for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire  but also as tall  slender figures  and femininity and white skin. And this is a legacy that was built for me  and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on. And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point  and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like   Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen.  And first  I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive. But unfortunately  I have to inform you that in       a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway  every single one that was hired  and of the     models that were hired  only     or less than four percent  were non white. The next question people always ask is   Can I be a model when I grow up   And the first answer is   I don't know  they don't put me in charge of that.  But the second answer  and what I really want to say to these little girls is   Why  You know  You can be anything. You could be the President of the United States  or the inventor of the next Internet  or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet  which would be awesome  because you'd be the first one.  If  after this amazing list  they still are like   No  no  Cameron  I want to be a model   well  then I say   Be my boss.  Because I'm not in charge of anything  and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H M  or the next Steven Meisel. Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up. It's out of your control  and it's awesome  and it's not a career path. I will demonstrate for you now    years of accumulated model knowledge  because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons  it can just be distilled right now. So  if the photographer is right there  the light is right there  like a nice HMI  and the client says   We want a walking shot   this leg goes first  nice and long  this arm goes back  this arm goes forward  the head is at three quarters  and you just go back and forth  just do that  and then you look back at your imaginary friends                times. It will look something like this. Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle. That was    I don't know what happened there. Unfortunately  after you've gone to school  and you have a r sum  and you've done a few jobs  you can't say anything anymore  so if you say you want to be the President of the United States  but your r sum  reads   Underwear Model     years   people give you a funny look. The next question is   Do they retouch all the photos   And yeah  they pretty much retouch all the photos  but that is only a small component of what's happening. This picture is the very first picture that I ever took  and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini  and I didn't even have my period yet. I know we're getting personal  but I was a young girl. This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier. Here's me on the same day as this shoot. My friend got to come. Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue. Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine. And here's me today. And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me. They are constructions  and they are constructions by a group of professionals  by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre production and post production  and they build this. That's not me. Okay  so the next question people always ask me is   Do you get free stuff   I do have too many   inch heels which I never get to wear  except for earlier  but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life  and that's what we don't like to talk about. I grew up in Cambridge  and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free. When I was a teenager  I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course  we got pulled over  and all it took was a  Sorry  officer   and we were on our way. And I got these free things because of how I look  not who I am  and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are. I live in New York  and last year  of the         teenagers that were stopped and frisked      of them were black and Latino  and most of them were young men. And there are only         young black and Latino men in New York  so for them  it's not a question of   Will I get stopped   but  How many times will I get stopped  When will I get stopped   When I was researching this talk  I found out that of the    year old girls in the United States      don't like their bodies  and that number goes to     by the time that they're   . So  the last question people ask me is   What is it like to be a model   And I think the answer that they're looking for is   If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair  you will be so happy and fabulous.  And when we're backstage  we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that. We say   It's really amazing to travel  and it's amazing to get to work with creative  inspired  passionate people.  And those things are true  but they're only one half of the story  because the thing that we never say on camera  that I have never said on camera  is   I am insecure.  And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day. And if you ever are wondering   If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair  will I be happier   you just need to meet a group of models  because they have the thinnest thighs  the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes  and they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet. When I was writing this talk  I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance  because on the one hand  I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say   Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor   and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with   and it doesn't always make me happy.  But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries. But I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great that I got to come before    or    or    years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career  because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job  or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college  which seems so important right now. If there's a takeaway to this talk  I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures. Thank you. So  before I became a dermatologist  I started in general medicine  as most dermatologists do in Britain. At the end of that time  I went off to Australia  about    years ago. What you learn when you go to Australia is the Australians are very competitive. And they are not magnanimous in victory. And that happened a lot   You pommies  you can't play cricket  rugby.  I could accept that. But moving into work    and we have each week what's called a journal club  when you'd sit down with the other doctors and you'd study a scientific paper in relation to medicine. And after week one  it was about cardiovascular mortality  a dry subject    how many people die of heart disease  what the rates are. And they were competitive about this   You pommies  your rates of heart disease are shocking.  And of course  they were right. Australians have about a third less heart disease than we do    less deaths from heart attacks  heart failure  less strokes    they're generally a healthier bunch. And of course they said this was because of their fine moral standing  their exercise  because they're Australians and we're weedy pommies  and so on. But it's not just Australia that has better health than Britain. Within Britain  there is a gradient of health    and this is what's called standardized mortality  basically your chances of dying. This is looking at data from the paper about    years ago  but it's true today. Comparing your rates of dying    degrees north    that's the South  that's London and places    by latitude  and    degrees    the bad news is that's here  Glasgow. I'm from Edinburgh. Worse news  that's even Edinburgh. So what accounts for this horrible space here between us up here in southern Scotland and the South  Now  we know about smoking  deep fried Mars bars  chips    the Glasgow diet. All of these things. But this graph is after taking into account all of these known risk factors. This is after accounting for smoking  social class  diet  all those other known risk factors. We are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go. Now  sunlight  of course  comes into this. And vitamin D has had a great deal of press  and a lot of people get concerned about it. And we need vitamin D. It's now a requirement that children have a certain amount. My grandmother grew up in Glasgow  back in the     s and '  s when rickets was a real problem and cod liver oil was brought in. And that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city. And I as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother. I distinctly    nobody forgets cod liver oil. But an association  The higher people's blood levels of vitamin D are  the less heart disease they have  the less cancer. There seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin D is very good for you. And it is  to prevent rickets and so on. But if you give people vitamin D supplements  you don't change that high rate of heart disease. And the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great. So what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town. It's not the only reason preventing heart disease. High vitamin D levels  I think  are a marker for sunlight exposure  and sunlight exposure  in methods I'm going to show  is good for heart disease. Anyway  I came back from Australia  and despite the obvious risks to my health  I moved to Aberdeen. Now  in Aberdeen  I started my dermatology training. But I also became interested in research  and in particular I became interested in this substance  nitric oxide. Now these three guys up here  Furchgott  Ignarro and Murad  won the Nobel Prize for medicine back in     . And they were the first people to describe this new chemical transmitter  nitric oxide. What nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels  so it lowers your blood pressure. It also dilates the coronary arteries  so it stops angina. And what was remarkable about it was in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body  we thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin  or nerve transmission. Very complex processes with very complex chemicals that fit into very complex receptors. And here's this incredibly simple molecule  a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together  and yet these are hugely important for  unclear  our low blood pressure  for neurotransmission  for many  many things  but particularly cardiovascular health. And I started doing research  and we found  very excitingly  that the skin produces nitric oxide. So it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises. It arises in the skin. Well  having found that and published that  I thought  well  what's it doing  How do you have low blood pressure in your skin  It's not the heart. What do you do  So I went off to the States  as many people do if they're going to do research  and I spent a few years in Pittsburgh. This is Pittsburgh. And I was interested in these really complex systems. We thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death  and how cells survive  and their resistance to other things. And I first off started work in cell culture  growing cells  and then I was using knockout mouse models    mice that couldn't make the gene. We worked out a mechanism  which    NO was helping cells survive. And I then moved back to Edinburgh. And in Edinburgh  the experimental animal we use is the medical student. It's a species close to human  with several advantages over mice  They're free  you don't shave them  they feed themselves  and nobody pickets your office saying   Save the lab medical student.  So they're really an ideal model. But what we found was that we couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice. It seemed we couldn't turn off the production of nitric oxide in the skin of humans. We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it  we injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide. And the reason for this  it turned out  after two or three years' work  was that in the skin we have huge stores not of nitric oxide  because nitric oxide is a gas  and it's released     Poof      and in a few seconds it's away  but it can be turned into these forms of nitric oxide    nitrate  NO   nitrite  NO   nitrosothiols. And these are more stable  and your skin has got really large stores of NO. And we then thought to ourselves  with those big stores  I wonder if sunlight might activate those stores and release them from the skin  where the stores are about    times as big as what's in the circulation. Could the sun activate those stores into the circulation  and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system  Well  I'm an experimental dermatologist  so what we did was we thought we'd have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight. And so what we did was we took a bunch of volunteers and we exposed them to ultraviolet light. So these are kind of sunlamps. Now  what we were careful to do was  vitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story. So we used ultraviolet A  which doesn't make vitamin D. When we put people under a lamp for the equivalent of about    minutes of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh  what we produced was  we produced a rise in circulating nitric oxide. So we put patients with these subjects under the UV  and their NO levels do go up  and their blood pressure goes down. Not by much  as an individual level  but enough at a population level to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population. And when we shone UV at them  or when we warmed them up to the same level as the lamps  but didn't actually let the rays hit the skin  this didn't happen. So this seems to be a feature of ultraviolet rays hitting the skin. Now  we're still collecting data. A few good things here  This appeared to be more marked in older people. I'm not sure exactly how much. One of the subjects here was my mother in law  and clearly I do not know her age. But certainly in people older than my wife  this appears to be a more marked effect. And the other thing I should mention was there was no change in vitamin D. This is separate from vitamin D. So vitamin D is good for you    it stops rickets  it prevents calcium metabolism  important stuff. But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D. Now  one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place. If your leg is chopped off and you lose blood  your body will clamp down  increase the heart rate  do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up. That is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle. So what we've next done is we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation. So we've measured    this is again  notice no tail and hairless  this is a medical student. In the arm  you can measure blood flow in the arm by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it. And what we've shown is that doing a sham irradiation    this is the thick line here    this is shining UV on the arm so it warms up but keeping it covered so the rays don't hit the skin. There is no change in blood flow  in dilatation of the blood vessels. But the active irradiation  during the UV and for an hour after it  there is dilation of the blood vessels. This is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure  by which you dilate the coronary arteries also  to let the blood be supplied with the heart. So here  further data that ultraviolet    that's sunlight    has benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system. So we thought we'd just kind of model    Different amounts of UV hit different parts of the Earth at different times of year  so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide    the nitrates  nitrites  nitrosothiols in the skin    cleave to release NO. Different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that. So you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that. And you can look    So  if you live on the equator  the sun comes straight overhead  it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere. In winter or summer  it's the same amount of light. If you live up here  in summer the sun is coming fairly directly down  but in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere  and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out  and the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth are different from summer to winter. So what you can do is you can multiply those data by the NO that's released and you can calculate how much nitric oxide would be released from the skin into the circulation. Now  if you're on the equator here    that's these two lines here  the red line and the purple line    the amount of nitric oxide that's released is the area under the curve  it's the area in this space here. So if you're on the equator  December or June  you've got masses of NO being released from the skin. So Ventura is in southern California. In summer  you might as well be at the equator. It's great. Lots of NO is released. Ventura mid winter  well  there's still a decent amount. Edinburgh in summer  the area beneath the curve is pretty good  but Edinburgh in winter  the amount of NO that can be released is next to nothing  tiny amounts. So what do we think  We're still working at this story  we're still developing it  we're still expanding it. We think it's very important. We think it probably accounts for a lot of the north south health divide within Britain  It's of relevance to us. We think that the skin    well  we know that the skin has got very large stores of nitric oxide as these various other forms. We suspect a lot of these come from diet  green leafy vegetables  beetroot  lettuce has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin. We think they're then stored in the skin  and we think the sunlight releases this where it has generally beneficial effects. And this is ongoing work  but dermatologists    I mean  I'm a dermatologist. My day job is saying to people   You've got skin cancer  it's caused by sunlight  don't go in the sun.  I actually think a far more important message is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight. Yes  sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer  but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher than deaths from skin cancer. And I think that we need to be more aware of  and we need to find the risk benefit ratio. How much sunlight is safe  and how can we finesse this best for our general health  So  thank you very much indeed. You know  my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch. I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids  and when my daughter was four  we got to watch  The Wizard of Oz  together. It totally dominated her imagination for months. Her favorite character was Glinda  of course. It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand. But you watch that movie enough times  and you start to realize how unusual it is. Now we live today  and are raising our children  in a kind of children's fantasy spectacular industrial complex. But  The Wizard of Oz  stood alone. It did not start that trend. Forty years later was when the trend really caught on  with  interestingly  another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards. Do you know what I'm talking about   Laughter  Yeah. Now  there's a big difference between these two movies  a couple of really big differences between  The Wizard of Oz  and all the movies we watch today. One is there's very little violence in  The Wizard of Oz.  The monkeys are rather aggressive  as are the apple trees. But I think if  The Wizard of Oz  were made today  the wizard would say   Dorothy  you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold. Use your magic slippers to defeat the computer generated armies of the Wicked Witch.  But that's not how it happens. Another thing that's really unique about  The Wizard of Oz  to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female. Now I started to notice this when I actually showed  Star Wars  to my daughter  which was years later  and the situation was different. At that point I also had a son. He was only three at the time. He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that. But he was the second child  and the level of supervision had plummeted.  Laughter  So he wandered in  and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling  and I don't think he understands what's going on  but he is sure soaking in it. And I wonder what he's soaking in. Is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty  Is he picking up on the fact that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government  Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for Aunt Beru  and of course this princess  who's really cool  but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe  which he does by the magic that he was born with  Compare this to      with  The Wizard of Oz.  How does Dorothy win her movie  By making friends with everybody and being a leader. That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in    Oz  right     and not the world of dudes fighting  which is where we kind of have to be. Why is there so much Force    capital F  Force    in the movies we have for our kids  and so little yellow brick road  There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy violent movie has on girls  and you should do that reading. It's very good. I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe. I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co ed.  Laughter  I think there was a first kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie  right  I finished my quest  I got the girl. Why are you still standing there  I don't know what I'm supposed to do. The movies are very  very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward  and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys. It's almost as though if you're a boy  you are a dopey animal  and if you are a girl  you should bring your warrior costume. There are plenty of exceptions  and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you. But they do send a message to boys  that they are not  the boys are not really the target audience. They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy  but they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy. There's no models for them. And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids  and as three dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are  these are still war movies. And  of course  the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic  every single one of them about the journey of a boy  or a man  or two men who are friends  or a man and his son  or two men who are raising a little girl. Until  as many of you are thinking  this year  when they finally came out with  Brave.  I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now. Do you remember what the critics said when  Brave  came out   Aw  I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie.  It's very good. Don't let that stop you. Now  almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test. I don't know if you've heard of this. It has not yet caught on and caught fire  but maybe today we will start a movement. Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist  and back in the mid '  s  she recorded this conversation she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw. And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask  Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines  So try to meet that bar. And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie  And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like   Laughter  Right  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much. Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff. It does happen. I've seen it  and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love. In fact  this week I went to see a very high quality movie   Argo.  Right  Oscar buzz  doing great at the box office  a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is. It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test. And I don't think it should  because a lot of the movie  I don't know if you've seen it  but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis. We've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep  angst ridden conversations in this hideout  and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say   Are you coming to bed  honey   That's Hollywood for you. So let's look at the numbers.       of the     most popular movies  how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists  Eleven. It's not bad. It's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to Congress  so that's good. But there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down. Last year  The New York Times published a study that the government had done. Here's what it said. One out of five women in America say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life. Now  I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment. I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that. I don't even think that music videos or pornography are really directly related to that  but something is going wrong  and when I hear that statistic  one of the things I think of is that's a lot of sexual assailants. Who are these guys  What are they learning  What are they failing to learn  Are they absorbing the story that a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward  which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak  Are we soaking up that story  You know  as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing  we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them. We have tools at our disposal like  girl power   and we hope that that will help  but I gotta wonder  is girl power going to protect them if  at the same time  actively or passively  we are training our sons to maintain their boy power  I mean  I think the Netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important  and I'm talking mainly to the dads here. I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood. The definition of manhood is already turning upside down. You've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner. They're throwing it up in the air. So our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this  some new relationship with each other  and I think we really have to show them  and model for them  how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them  and wants to be on their team  and stands up against the real bad guys  who are the men who want to abuse the women. And I think our job in the Netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test  if we can find them  and to seek out the heroines who are there  who show real courage  who bring people together  and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say   I want to be on their team   because they're going to be on their team. When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in  Star Wars   do you know what she said  Obi Wan. Obi Wan Kenobi and Glinda. What do these two have in common  Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress. I think these people are experts. I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else  and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential. Now  they are leaders. I like that kind of quest for my daughter  and I like that kind of quest for my son. I want more quests like that. I want fewer quests where my son is told   Go out and fight it alone   and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team  maybe a team led by women  to help other people become better and be better people  like the Wizard of Oz. Thank you. This is how war starts. One day you're living your ordinary life  you're planning to go to a party  you're taking your children to school  you're making a dentist appointment. The next thing  the telephones go out  the TVs go out  there's armed men on the street  there's roadblocks. Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation. It stops. I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine  a Bosnian friend  about what happened to her  because I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like. She was walking to work one day in April        in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank. She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party. Great person. And suddenly she sees a tank ambling down the main road of Sarajevo knocking everything out of its path. She thinks she's dreaming  but she's not. And she runs as any of us would have done and takes cover  and she hides behind a trash bin  in her high heels and her miniskirt. And as she's hiding there  she's feeling ridiculous  but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and she thinks   I feel like Alice in Wonderland going down the rabbit hole  down  down  down into chaos  and my life will never be the same again.  A few weeks later  my friend was in a crowd of people pushing with her infant son in her arms to give him to a stranger on a bus  which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo to take children out so they could be safe. And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front  crowds and crowds of people   Take my child  Take my child   and passing her son to someone through a window. And she didn't see him for years. The siege went on for three and a half years  and it was a siege without water  without power  without electricity  without heat  without food  in the middle of Europe  in the middle of the   th century. I had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege  and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there because it's taught me everything  not just about being a reporter  but about being a human being. I learned about compassion. I learned about ordinary people who could be heroes. I learned about sharing. I learned about camaraderie. Most of all  I learned about love. Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos  I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors  share food  raise their children  drag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life  helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals. I learned so much about myself. Martha Gellhorn  who's one of my heroes  once said   You can only love one war. The rest is responsibility.  I went on to cover many  many  many wars after that  so many that I lost count  but there was nothing like Sarajevo. Last April  I went back to a very strange    what I called a deranged high school reunion. What it was  was the   th anniversary of the siege  the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo  and I don't like the word  anniversary   because it sounds like a party  and this was not a party. It was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war  humanitarian aid workers  and of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves. And the thing that struck me the most  that broke my heart  was walking down the main street of Sarajevo  where my friend Aida saw the tank coming    years ago  and in that road were more than        red chairs  empty  and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege  just in Sarajevo  not in all of Bosnia  and it stretched from one end of the city to a large part of it  and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs for the children. I now cover Syria  and I started reporting it because I believed that it needs to be done. I believe a story there has to be told. I see  again  a template of the war in Bosnia. And when I first arrived in Damascus  I saw this strange moment where people didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend  and it was exactly the same in Bosnia and nearly every other country I've seen where war comes. People don't want to believe it's coming  so they don't leave  they don't leave before they can. They don't get their money out. They stay because you want to stay in your home. And then war and chaos descend. Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot. In       I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda. Between April and August        one million people were slaughtered. Now if those        chairs freaked me out with the sheer number  I want you just for a second to think of a million people. And to give you some example  I remember standing and looking down a road as far as I could see  at least a mile  and there were bodies piled twice my height of the dead. And that was just a small percentage of the dead. And there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes. So we learn a lot from war  and I mention Rwanda because it is one place  like South Africa  where nearly    years on  there is healing. Fifty six percent of the parliamentarians are women  which is fantastic  and there's also within the national constitution now  you're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi. You're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity  which is  of course  what started the slaughter in the first place. And an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story  or I find it beautiful. There was a group of children  mixed Hutus and Tutsis  and a group of women who were adopting them  and they lined up and one was just given to the next. There was no kind of compensation for  you're a Tutsi  you're a Hutu  you might have killed my mother  you might have killed my father. They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation  and I find this remarkable. So when people ask me how I continue to cover war  and why I continue to do it  this is why. When I go back to Syria  next week in fact  what I see is incredibly heroic people  some of them fighting for democracy  for things we take for granted every single day. And that's pretty much why I do it. In       I had a little baby boy  and I call him my miracle child  because after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life  this ray of hope was born. And I called him Luca  which means  The bringer of light   because he does bring light to my life. But I'm talking about him because when he was four months old  my foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad where I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime and during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards  and I remember getting on the plane in tears  crying to be separated from my son  and while I was there  a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine said to me   What are you doing here  Why aren't you home with Luca   And I said   Well  I have to see.  It was      which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq   I have to see  I have to see what is happening here. I have to report it.  And he said   Go home  because if you miss his first tooth  if you miss his first step  you'll never forgive yourself. But there will always be another war.  And there  sadly  will always be wars. And I am deluding myself if I think  as a journalist  as a reporter  as a writer  what I do can stop them. I can't. I'm not Kofi Annan. He can't stop a war. He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it. I'm not a U.N. conflict resolution person. I'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor  and I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt to have people dying in front of me  and I couldn't save them. All I am is a witness. My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless. A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world. And that's what I try to do. I'm not always successful  and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating  because you feel like you're writing into a void  or you feel like no one cares. Who cares about Syria  Who cares about Bosnia  Who cares about the Congo  the Ivory Coast  Liberia  Sierra Leone  all of these strings of places that I will remember for the rest of my life  But my m tier is to bear witness and that is the crux  the heart of the matter  for us reporters who do this. And all I can really do is hope  not to policymakers or politicians  because as much as I'd like to have faith that they read my words and do something  I don't delude myself. But what I do hope is that if you remember anything I said or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast  if you can remember the story of Sarajevo  or the story of Rwanda  then I've done my job. Thank you very much. What I want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what's scheduled. Foreign policy  you can figure that out by watching  I don't know  Rachel Maddow or somebody  but    Laughter    I want to talk about young people and structure  young people and structure. This was last Wednesday afternoon at a school in Brooklyn  New York  at Cristo Rey High School  run by the Jesuits. And I was talking to this group of students  and take a look at them. They were around me in three directions. You'll noticed that almost all of them are minority. You'll notice that the building is rather austere. It's an old New York school building  nothing fancy. They still have old blackboards and whatnot. And there are about     kids in this school  and the school's been going now for four years  and they're about to graduate their first class. Twenty two people are graduating  and all    are going to college. They all come from homes where there is  for the most part  just one person in the home  usually the mother or the grandmother  and that's it  and they come here for their education and for their structure. Now I had this picture taken  and it was put up on my Facebook page last week  and somebody wrote in   Huh  why does he have him standing at attention like that   And then they said   But he looks good.   Laughter  He does look good  because kids need structure  and the trick I play in all of my school appearances is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids  I then invite them to ask questions  and when they raise their hands  I say   Come up   and I make them come up and stand in front of me. I make them stand at attention like a soldier. Put your arms straight down at your side  look up  open your eyes  stare straight ahead  and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear. No slouching  no pants hanging down  none of that stuff. And this young man  his name is    his last name Cruz    he loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral. So people think I'm being unkind to this kid. No  we're having a little fun. And the thing about it  I've done this for years  the younger they are  the more fun it is. When I get six  and seven year olds in a group  I have to figure out how to keep them quiet. You know that they'll always start yakking. And so I play a little game with them before I make them stand at attention. I say   Now listen. In the army  when we want you to pay attention  we have a command. It's called 'at ease.' It means everybody be quiet and pay attention. Listen up. Do you understand    Uh huh  uh huh  uh huh.  Let's practice. Everybody start chatting.  And I let them go for about    seconds  then I go   At ease    Huh    Laughter   Yes  General. Yes  General.  Try it with your kids. See if it works.  Laughter  I don't think so. But anyway  it's a game I play  and it comes obviously from my military experience. Because for the majority of my adult life  I worked with young kids  teenagers with guns  I call them. And we would bring them into the army  and the first thing we would do is to put them in an environment of structure  put them in ranks  make them all wear the same clothes  cut all their hair off so they look alike  make sure that they are standing in ranks. We teach them how to go right face  left face  so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions. It gives them structure. And then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately  the drill sergeant. And they hate him. And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them  and telling them to do all kinds of awful things. But then the most amazing thing happens over time. Once that structure is developed  once they understand the reason for something  once they understand   Mama ain't here  son. I'm your worst nightmare. I'm your daddy and your mommy. And that's just the way it is. You got that  son  Yeah  and then when I ask you a question  there are only three possible answers  yes  sir  no  sir  and no excuse  sir. Don't start telling me why you didn't do something. It's yes  sir  no  sir  no excuse  sir.   You didn't shave.  But sir     No  don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning. I'm telling you you didn't shave.   No excuse  sir.  Attaboy  you're learning fast.  But you'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure. In    weeks  they have a skill. They are mature. And you know what  they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant. They come to respect him. And so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children. I spend a lot of time with youth groups  and I say to people   When does the education process begin   We're always talking about   Let's fix the schools. Let's do more for our teachers. Let's put more computers in our schools. Let's get it all online.  That isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer. But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with. When does the learning process begin  Does it begin in first grade  No  no  it begins the first time a child in a mother's arms looks up at the mother and says   Oh  this must be my mother. She's the one who feeds me. Oh yeah  when I don't feel so good down there  she takes care of me. It's her language I will learn.  And at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age  but by three months  that's her. And if the person doing it  whether it's the mother or grandmother  whoever's doing it  that is when the education process begins. That's when language begins. That's when love begins. That's when structure begins. That's when you start to imprint on the child that  you are special  you are different from every other child in the world. And we're going to read to you.  A child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school. A child who doesn't know his or her colors or doesn't know how to tell time  doesn't know how to tie shoes  doesn't know how to do those things  and doesn't know how to do something that goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid  mind. Mind your manners  Mind your adults  Mind what you're saying  This is the way children are raised properly. And I watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they're  much to the distress of my children  they are acting just like we did. You know  You imprint them. And that's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school. And I'm working at all the energy I have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool  we need Head Start  we need prenatal care. The education process begins even before the child is born  and if you don't do that  you're going to have difficulty. And we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools where kids are coming to first grade and their eyes are blazing  they've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go  and then they realize they're not like the other first graders who know books  have been read to  can do their alphabet. And by the third grade  the kids who didn't have that structure and minding in the beginning start to realize they're behind  and what do they do  They act it out. They act it out  and they're on their way to jail or they're on their way to being dropouts. It's predictable. If you're not at the right reading level at third grade  you are a candidate for jail at age     and we have the highest incarceration rate because we're not getting our kids the proper start in life. The last chapter in my book is called  The Gift of a Good Start.  The gift of a good start. Every child ought to have a good start in life. I was privileged to have that kind of good start. I was not a great student. I was a public school kid in New York City  and I didn't do well at all. I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript from kindergarten through college. I wanted it when I was writing my first book. I wanted to see if my memory was correct  and  my God  it was.  Laughter  Straight C everywhere. And I finally bounced through high school  got into the City College of New York with a   .  average  which I shouldn't have been allowed in with  and then I started out in engineering  and that only lasted six months.  Laughter  And then I went into geology   rocks for jocks.  This is easy. And then I found ROTC. I found something that I did well and something that I loved doing  and I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way. And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military. And I say to young kids everywhere  as you're growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you  always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing  and when you find those two things together  man  you got it. That's what's going on. And that's what I found. Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there. I'd been there four and a half going on five years  and my grades were not doing particularly well  and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration. And so they said   But he does so well in ROTC. Look  he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else.  And so they said   Look  let's take his ROTC grades and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens.  And they did  and it brought me up to  . .  Laughter  Yep.  Laughter   Applause  They said   It's good enough for government work. Give him to the army. We'll never see him again. We'll never see him again.  So they shipped me off to the army  and lo and behold  many years later  I'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had.  Laughter  So  I tell young people everywhere  it ain't where you start in life  it's what you do with life that determines where you end up in life  and you are blessed to be living in a country that  no matter where you start  you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself  you believe in the society and the country  and you believe that you can self improve and educate yourself as you go along. And that's the key to success. But it begins with the gift of a good start. If we don't give that gift to each and every one of our kids  if we don't invest at the earliest age  we're going to be running into difficulties. It's why we have a dropout rate of roughly    percent overall and almost    percent of our minority population living in low income areas  because they're not getting the gift of a good start. My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family  a good family  but having a family that said to me   Now listen  we came to this country in banana boats in      and     . We worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day. We're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose or get in trouble. And don't even think about dropping out.  If I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people that   You know  I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out   they'd said   We're dropping you out. We'll get another kid.  They had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx  but they had more than just expectations for us. They stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame   Don't you shame this family.  Sometimes I would get in trouble  and my parents were coming home  and I was in my room waiting for what's going to happen  and I would sit there saying to myself   Okay  look  take the belt and hit me  but  God  don't give me that 'shame the family' bit again.  It devastated me when my mother did that to me. And I also had this extended network. Children need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe  a family  a community. In my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings. I don't know how many of you are New Yorkers  but there were these tenement buildings  and these women were always hanging out one of the windows  leaning on a pillow. They never left.  Laughter  I  so help me God  I grew up walking those streets  and they were always there. They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked.  Laughter  They never did anything. But what they did was keep us in play. They kept us in play. And they didn't care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general  and they never expected any generals in the family  as long as you got an education and then you got a job.  Don't give us any of that self actualization stuff. You get a job and get out of the house. We don't have time to waste for that. And then you can support us. That's the role of you guys.  And so  it's so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families  all families. And it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people  and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren  it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back and find kids like Mr. Cruz who can make it if you give them the structure  if you reach back and help  if you mentor  if you invest in boys and girls clubs  if you work with your school system  make sure it's the best school system  and not just your kid's school  but the school uptown in Harlem  not just downtown Montessori on the West Side. All of us have to have a commitment to do that. And we're not just investing in the kids. We're investing in our future. We're going to be a minority majority country in one more generation. Those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority. And we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority. We have to make sure they're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours  a country that is like no other  a country that amazes me every single day  a country that's fractious. We're always arguing with each other. That's how the system's supposed to work. It's a country of such contrasts  but it's a nation of nations. We touch every nation. Every nation touches us. We are a nation of immigrants. That's why we need sound immigration policy. It's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation  or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty. One of the great stories I love to tell is about my love of going to my hometown of New York and walking up Park Avenue on a beautiful day and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by from all over the world. But what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler. Gotta have a dirty water dog.  Laughter  And no matter where I am or what I'm doing  I've got to do that. I even did it when I was Secretary of State. I'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria    Laughter    be walking up the street  and I would hit around   th Street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler. In those days  I had five bodyguards around me and three New York City police cars would roll alongside to make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue.  Laughter  And I would order the hot dog from the guy  and he'd start to fix it  and then he'd look around at the bodyguards and the police cars     I've got a green card  I've got a green card    Laughter   It's okay  it's okay.  But now I'm alone. I'm alone. I've got no bodyguards  I've got no police cars. I've got nothing. But I gotta have my hot dog. I did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening down by Columbus Circle. And the scene repeats itself so often. I'll go up and ask for my hot dog  and the guy will fix it  and as he's finishing  he'll say   I know you. I see you on television. You're  well  you're General Powell.   Yes  yes.  Oh ...   I hand him the money.  No  General. You can't pay me. I've been paid. America has paid me. I never forget where I came from. But now I'm an American. Sir  thank you.  I accept the generosity  continue up the street  and it washes over me  my God  it's the same country that greeted my parents this way    years ago. So we are still that magnificent country  but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world  and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind. Thank you very much. So I want to talk to you about two things tonight. Number one  Teaching surgery and doing surgery is really hard. And second  that language is one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world. And in my little corner of the world  these two things are actually related  and I want to tell you how tonight. Now  nobody wants an operation. Who here has had surgery  Did you want it  Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation. Nobody wants an operation. In particular  nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain  that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school  that leave a big scar. But if you have to have an operation  what you really want is a minimally invasive operation. That's what I want to talk to you about tonight    how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better universal translator. Now  this type of surgery is hard  and it starts by putting people to sleep  putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen  blowing them up like a balloon  sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen    it's dangerous stuff    and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen. So let's see what it looks like. So this is gallbladder surgery. We perform a million of these a year in the United States alone. This is the real thing. There's no blood. And you can see how focused the surgeons are  how much concentration it takes. You can see it in their faces. It's hard to teach  and it's not all that easy to learn. We do about five million of these in the United States and maybe    million of these worldwide. All right  you've all heard the term   He's a born surgeon.  Let me tell you  surgeons are not born. Surgeons are not made either. There are no little tanks where we're making surgeons. Surgeons are trained one step at a time. It starts with a foundation  basic skills. We build on that and we take people  hopefully  to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant. Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training. And when they do all of that for about five years  they get the coveted board certification. If you need surgery  you want to be operated on by a board certified surgeon. You get your board certificate  and you can go out into practice. And eventually  if you're lucky  you achieve mastery. Now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the United States  SAGES  started in the late     s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures. Now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of Surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified. It's not a lecture  it's not a course  it's all of that plus a high stakes assessment. It's hard. Now just this past year  one of our partners  the American College of Surgeons  teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be FLS  Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery  certified before they do minimally invasive surgery. And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada  No  we just said all surgeons. So to lift this education and training worldwide is a very large task  something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world. SAGES does surgery all over the world  teaching and educating surgeons. So we have a problem  and one of the problems is distance. We can't travel everywhere. We need to make the world a smaller place. And I think that we can develop some tools to do so. And one of the tools I like personally is using video. So I was inspired by a friend. This is Allan Okrainec from Toronto. And he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing. So here's Allan teaching an English speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery. Very inspiring. But for this examination  which is really hard  we have a problem. Even people who say they speak English  only    percent pass. Because for them it's not a surgery test  it's an English test. Let me bring it to you locally. I work at the Cambridge Hospital. It's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility. We have more than     translators covering    languages  and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital. It's a big labor intensive effort. If you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients    not just teaching surgeons  just trying to talk to your patients    there aren't enough translators in the world. We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest. At our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors to people who just got here last week. And you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to. And there isn't always a translator available. So we need tools. We need a universal translator. One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world. It's really about setting up a dialogue. We have a lot to learn. Here in the United States we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world. Maybe we have something to learn as well. So I'm passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world. This past year I've been in Latin America  I've been in China  talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery. And everywhere I go the barrier is   We want this  but we need it in our language.  So here's what we think we want to do  Imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously. I want to talk to the people in Asia  Latin America  Africa  Europe seamlessly  accurately and in a cost effective fashion using technology. And it has to be bi directional. They have to be able to teach us something as well. It's a big task. So we looked for a universal translator  I thought there would be one out there. Your webpage has translation  your cellphone has translation  but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery. Because we need a lexicon. What is a lexicon  A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain. I need to have a health care lexicon. And in that I need a surgery lexicon. That's a tall order. We have to work at it. So let me show you what we're doing. This is research    can't buy it. We're working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator. It starts with a framework system where when the surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology  we then add another technology to do video conferencing. But we don't have the words yet  so we add a third technology. And now we've got the words  and we can apply the special sauce  the translation. We get the words up in a window and then apply the magic. We work with a fourth technology. And we currently have access to eleven language pairs. More to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place. And I'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful. Narrator  Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. Module five  manual skills practice. Students may display captions in their native language. Steven Schwaitzberg  If you're in Latin America  you click the  I want it in Spanish  button and out it comes in real time in Spanish. But if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time  by using technology in a constructive fashion  you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian    on and on and on  simultaneously without the use of human translators. But that's the lectures. If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning  it's knowledge and skills. The difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much. So we're going to take it one step further  we've brought my friend Allan back. Allan Okrainec  Today we're going to practice suturing. This is how you hold the needle. Grab the needle at the tip. It's important to be accurate. Aim for the black dots. Orient your loop this way. Now go ahead and cut. Very good Oscar. I'll see you next week. SS  So that's what we're working on in our quest for the universal translator. We want it to be bi directional. We have a need to learn as well as to teach. I can think of a million uses for a tool like this. As we think about intersecting technologies    everybody has a cell phone with a camera    we could use this everywhere  whether it be health care  patient care  engineering  law  conferencing  translating videos. This is a ubiquitous tool. In order to break down our barriers  we have to learn to talk to people  to demand that people work on translation. We need it for our everyday life  in order to make the world a smaller place. Thank you very much. I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question  which has an equally disturbing answer. My topic is the secrets of domestic violence  and the question I'm going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks  Why does she stay  Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her  I'm not a psychiatrist  a social worker or an expert in domestic violence. I'm just one woman with a story to tell. I was   . I had just graduated from Harvard College. I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine. I had my first apartment  my first little green American Express card  and I had a very big secret. My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate  many  many times. The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember. I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love  a psychological trap disguised as love  one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year. It may even be your story. I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor. I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College  an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School. I've spent most of my career working for Fortune     companies including Johnson   Johnson  Leo Burnett and The Washington Post. I've been married for almost    years to my second husband and we have three kids together. My dog is a black lab  and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone    all races  all religions  all income and education levels. It's everywhere. And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women  that it's a women's issue. Not exactly. Over    percent of abusers are men  and domestic abuse happens only in intimate  interdependent  long term relationships  in other words  in families  the last place we would want or expect to find violence  which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing. I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me  but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age. I was     and in the United States  women ages    to    are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages  and over     women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners  boyfriends  and husbands in the United States. I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence  its warning signs or its patterns. I met Conor on a cold  rainy January night. He sat next to me on the New York City subway  and he started chatting me up. He told me two things. One was that he  too  had just graduated from an Ivy League school  and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank. But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy. He had these big cheeks  these big apple cheeks and this wheat blond hair  and he seemed so sweet. One of the smartest things Conor did  from the very beginning  was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship. He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me. We started dating  and he loved everything about me  that I was smart  that I'd gone to Harvard  that I was passionate about helping teenage girls  and my job. He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams. Conor believed in me  as a writer and a woman  in a way that no one else ever had. And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret  which was that  as a very young boy starting at age four  he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather  and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade  even though he was very smart  and he'd spent almost    years rebuilding his life. Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him. If you had told me that this smart  funny  sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup  how short my skirts were  where I lived  what jobs I took  who my friends were and where I spent Christmas  I would have laughed at you  because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning. I didn't know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim. I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim. Now  Conor did not come home one day and announce   You know  hey  all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great  but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you     Laughter     so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises.  Instead  Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day  his dream job  and he said that he had quit his job because of me  because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore  and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive  dysfunctional family  and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side. Now  the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York  and my dream job  but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate  so I agreed  and I quit my job  and Conor and I left Manhattan together. I had no idea I was falling into crazy love  that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical  financial and psychological trap. The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts. And here's where those guns come in. As soon as we moved to New England    you know  that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe    he bought three guns. He kept one in the glove compartment of our car. He kept one under the pillows on our bed  and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times. And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy. He needed them to feel protected. But those guns were really a message for me  and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me  my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day. Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding. It was   a.m. I still had on my nightgown. I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment  and I got frustrated  and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream  and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall. Five days later  the ten bruises on my neck had just faded  and I put on my mother's wedding dress  and I married him. Despite what had happened  I was sure we were going to live happily ever after  because I loved him  and he loved me so much. And he was very  very sorry. He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me. It was an isolated incident  and he was never going to hurt me again. It happened twice more on the honeymoon. The first time  I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost  and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver's side window. And then a few days later  driving home from our honeymoon  he got frustrated by traffic  and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face. Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage. I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation. One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life  and the CDC reports that    million children are abused every year     million. So actually  I was in very good company. Back to my question  Why did I stay  The answer is easy. I didn't know he was abusing me. Even though he held those loaded guns to my head  pushed me down stairs  threatened to kill our dog  pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway  poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview  I never once thought of myself as a battered wife. Instead  I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man  and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons. The other question everybody asks is  why doesn't she just leave  Why didn't I walk out  I could have left any time. To me  this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask  because we victims know something you usually don't  It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser. Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her. Over    percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship  after she's gotten out  because then the abuser has nothing left to lose. Other outcomes include long term stalking  even after the abuser remarries  denial of financial resources  and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children  who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother. And still we ask  why doesn't she just leave  I was able to leave  because of one final  sadistic beating that broke through my denial. I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him. So I broke the silence. I told everyone  the police  my neighbors  my friends and family  total strangers  and I'm here today because you all helped me. We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines  self destructive women  damaged goods. The question   Why does she stay   is code for some people for   It's her fault for staying   as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us. But since publishing  Crazy Love   I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out  who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened  and who rebuilt lives    joyous  happy lives    as employees  wives and mothers  lives completely free of violence  like me. Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor. I remarried a kind and gentle man  and we have those three kids. I have that black lab  and I have that minivan. What I will never have again  ever  is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me. Right now  maybe you're thinking   Wow  this is fascinating   or   Wow  how stupid was she   but this whole time  I've actually been talking about you. I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves. Abuse could be affecting your daughter  your sister  your best friend right now. I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence. I'm still breaking the silence today. It's my way of helping other victims  and it's my final request of you. Talk about what you heard here. Abuse thrives only in silence. You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it. We victims need everyone. We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence. Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children  your coworkers  your friends and family. Recast survivors as wonderful  lovable people with full futures. Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene  deescalate it  show victims a safe way out. Together we can make our beds  our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be. Thank you. This is about a hidden corner of the labor market. It's the world of people who need to work ultra flexibly  if they're to work at all. So think  for instance  of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition  or somebody who's caring for a dependent adult  or a parent with complex child care needs. Their availability for work can be such that it's   A few hours today. Maybe I can work tomorrow  but I don't know if and when yet.  And it's extraordinarily difficult for these people to find the work that they so often need very badly. Which is a tragedy because there are employers who can use pools of very flexible local people booked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work. Imagine that you run a cafe. It's mid morning  the place is filling up. You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush. If you could get two extra workers for    minutes to start in an hour's time  you'd do it  but they'd have to be reliable  inducted in how your cafe works. They'd have to be available at very competitive rates. They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute. In reality  no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business  so you are going to muddle by  understaffed. And it's not just caterers  it's hoteliers  it's retailers  it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses. There's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people  possibly already once they've been inducted. At this level of the labor market  what you need is a marketplace for spare hours. They do exist. Here's how they work. So in this example  a distribution company has said  we've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning. Show us everyone who's available. It's found    workers. Everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow. They're all contactable in time for this booking. They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings. And this booking is within all the parameters for each individual. And they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking. Of course  they're all trained to work in warehouses. You can select as many of them as you want. They're from multiple agencies. It's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking. And it's monitoring their reliability. The people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones. They're likely to be more expensive. In an alternative view of this pool of local  very flexible people  here's a market research company  and it's inducted maybe    local people in how to do street interviewing. And they've got a new campaign. They want to run it next week. And they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted are available each hour next week. And they'll then decide when to do their street interviews. But is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market  Because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get. Let's make it personal. Imagine that a young woman    base of the economic pyramid  very little prospect of getting a job    what economic activity could she theoretically engage in  Well  she might be willing to work odd hours in a call center  in a reception area  in a mail room. She may be interested in providing local services to her community  babysitting  local deliveries  pet care. She may have possessions that she would like to trade at times she doesn't need them. So she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out. She might have a bike  a video games console she only uses occasionally. And you're probably thinking    because you're all very web aware    yes  and we're in the era of collaborative consumption  so she can go online and do all this. She can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed  she can go to TaskRabbit.com and say   I want to do local deliveries   and so on. These are good sites  but I believe we can go a step further. And the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all. Markets have changed beyond recognition in the last    years  but only for organizations at the top of the economy. If you're a Wall Street trader  you now take it for granted that you sell your financial assets in a system of markets that identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time  executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set. It analyzes supply and demand and pricing and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from. It manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways. It's all extremely low overhead. What have we gained at the bottom of the economy in terms of markets in the last    years  Basically classified adverts with a search facility. So why do we have this disparity between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading  and what the rest of us have  A modern market is more than a website  it's a web of interoperable marketplaces  back office mechanisms  regulatory regimes  settlement mechanisms  liquidity sources and so on. And when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning  she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today and then post that listing on multiple websites and wait for potential buyers to get in touch and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade. In the early days of this modern markets technology  the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power  their back office processes  their relationships  their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity. They asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes  and in a lot of cases they got it. But throughout the economy  there are facilities that could likewise leverage a new generation of markets for the benefit of all of us. And those facilities    I'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity  the licensing authorities that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time  the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels. These mechanisms  these facilities are not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo  they're controlled by the state. And the policymakers who sit on top of them are  I suggest  simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used to underpin a whole new era of markets. Like everyone else  those policymakers are taking it for granted that modern markets are the preserve of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves. Suppose we stopped taking that for granted. Suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S.  or the leader of any other developed nation  woke up and said   I'm never going to be able to create all the jobs I need in the current climate. I have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens. And for that they have to be able to access state of the art markets. How do I make that happen   And I think I can see a few eyes rolling. Politicians in a big  complex  sophisticated I.T. project  Oh  that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen. Not necessarily. There is a precedent for technology enabled service that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries and has been hugely successful  national lotteries. Let's take Britain as an example. Our government didn't design the national lottery  it didn't fund the national lottery  it doesn't operate the national lottery. It simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed. This act defines what a national lottery will look like. It specifies certain benefits that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators. And it puts some obligations on those operators. In terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses  this was an unqualified success. But let's suppose that our aim is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid. Could we use the same model  I believe we could. So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility. Let's call it national e markets  NEMs for short. Think of it as a regulated public utility. So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network. And it's a series of markets for low level trade that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company. And government has certain benefits it can uniquely bestow on these markets. It's about public spending going through these markets to buy public services at the local level. It's about interfacing these markets direct into the highest official channels in the land. It's about enshrining government's role as a publicist for these markets. It's about deregulating some sectors so that local people can enter them. So  taxi journeys might be one example. And there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits to be placed on the operators  and the key one is  of course  that the operators pay for everything  including all the interfacing into the public sector. So imagine that the operators make their return by building a percentage markup into each transaction. Imagine that there's a concession period defined of maybe    years in which they can take all these benefits and run with them. And imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told  whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction to fund the whole thing will get the deal. So government then exits the frame. This is now in the hands of the consortium. Either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity and make a percentage on all of it or it's all going to crash and burn  which is tough on their shareholders. It doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily. And there would be no constraints on alternative markets. So this would just be one more choice among millions of Internet forums. But it could be very different  because having access to those state backed facilities could incentivize this consortium to seriously invest in the service. Because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going to start making their return. So we're talking about sectors like home hair care  the hire of toys  farm work  hire of clothes even  meals delivered to your door  services for tourists  home care. This would be a world of very small trades  but very well informed  because national e markets will deliver data. So this is a local person potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market. And they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training if they wanted to go into that market. They'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents who wanted a pool of babysitters. Is it worth their while  Should they be looking at other sectors  Should they be moving to another part of the country where there's a shortage of babysitters  This kind of data can become routine. And this data can be used by investors. So if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training  an investor can pay for it and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals for maybe the next two years. This is a world of atomized capitalism. So it's small trades by small people  but it's very informed  safe  convenient  low overhead and immediate. Some rough research suggests this could unlock around     million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity in a country the size of the U.K. Does that sound improbable to you  That's what a lot of people said about turbo trading in financial exchanges    years ago. Do not underestimate the transformative power of truly modern markets. Thank you. It was a Saturday afternoon in May  and I suddenly realized that the next day was Mother's Day  and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom  so I started thinking about what should I get my mom for Mother's Day  I thought  why don't I make her an interactive Mother's Day card using the Scratch software that I'd been developing with my research group at the MIT Media Lab  We developed it so that people could easily create their own interactive stories and games and animations  and then share their creations with one another. So I thought  this would be an opportunity to use Scratch to make an interactive card for my mom. Before making my own Mother's Day card  I thought I would take a look at the Scratch website. So over the last several years  kids around the world ages   and up  have shared their projects  and I thought  I wonder if  of those three million projects  whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards. So in the search box I typed in  Mother's Day   and I was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards that showed up on the Scratch website  many of them just in the past    hours by procrastinators just like myself. So I started taking a look at them.  Music  I saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day. And the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom. Another one was an interactive project where  when you moved the mouse over the letters of  Happy Mom Day   it reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan. about how she had Googled to find out when Mother's Day was happening. she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting of how much she loved her mom. So I really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects. In fact  I liked it so much that  instead of making my own project  I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects.  Laughter  And actually  she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would. She wrote back to me and she said   I'm so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers.  So my mom was happy  and that made me happy  but actually I was even happier for another reason. I was happy because these kids were using Scratch just in the way that we had hoped that they would. As they created their interactive Mother's Day cards  you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies. What do I mean by fluent  I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves and to start expressing their ideas. When you become fluent with language  it means you can write an entry in your journal or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend. And it's similar with new technologies. By writing  be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards  these kids were showing that they were really fluent with new technologies. Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this  because a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology. I mean  all of us have heard young people referred to as  digital natives.  But actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term. I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives. When you really look at it  how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies  You often see them in situations like this  or like this  and there's no doubt that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing and chatting and texting and gaming. But that doesn't really make you fluent. So young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies  but a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies. It's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies. And I'm really interested in seeing  how can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies  And that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs  or code. So  increasingly  people are starting to recognize the importance of learning to code. You know  in recent years  there have been hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code. You look online  you'll see places like Codecademy and events like CoderDojo and sites like Girls Who Code  or Black Girls Code. It seems that everybody is getting into the act. You know  just at the beginning of this year  at the turn of the new year  New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn to code in     . A few months later  the country of Estonia decided that all of its first graders should learn to code. And that triggered a debate in the U.K. about whether all the children there should learn to code. Now  for some of you  when you hear about this  it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code. When many people think of coding  they think of it as something that only a very narrow sub community of people are going to be doing  and they think of coding looking like this. And in fact  if this is what coding is like  it will only be a narrow sub community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background that can code. But coding doesn't have to be like this. Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch. So in Scratch  to code  you just snap blocks together. In this case  you take a move block  snap it into a stack  and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story  in this case controlling the big fish. After you've created your program  you can click on  share   and then share your project with other people  so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well. So  of course  making a fish game isn't the only thing you can do with Scratch. Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website  there's everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials to interactive artwork  and  yes  interactive Mother's Day cards. So I think there's so many different ways that people can express themselves using this  to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world. And it doesn't just stay on the screen. You can also code to interact with the physical world around you. Here's an example from Hong Kong  where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor  so the light sensor detects the hole in the board  so as they move the physical saw  the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree. We're going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us. This is an example from a new version of Scratch that we'll be releasing in the next few months  and we're looking again to be able to push you in new directions. Here's an example. It uses the webcam. And as I move my hand  I can pop the balloons or I can move the bug. So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect  where you interact with gestures in the world. But instead of just playing someone else's game  you get to create the games  and if you see someone else's game  you can just say  see inside   and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it. So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is  and then  if there's so much video motion  it will then tell the balloon to pop. The same way that this uses the camera to get information into Scratch  you can also use the microphone. Here's an example of a project using the microphone. So I'm going to let all of you control this game using your voices. As kids are creating projects like this  they're learning to code  but even more importantly  they're coding to learn. Because as they learn to code  it enables them to learn many other things  opens up many new opportunities for learning. Again  it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing. When you learn to read and write  it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things. When you learn to read  you can then read to learn. And it's the same thing with coding. If you learn to code  you can code to learn. Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious. You learn more about how computers work. But that's just where it starts. When you learn to code  it opens up for you to learn many other things. Let me show you an example. Here's another project  and I saw this when I was visiting one of the computer clubhouses. These are after school learning centers that we helped start that help young people from low income communities learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies. And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago  I saw a    year old boy who was using our Scratch software to create a game somewhat like this one  and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game  but also he wanted to do more. He wanted to keep score. So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish  but he wanted to keep score  so that each time the big fish eats the little fish  the score would go up and it would keep track  and he didn't know how to do that. So I showed him. In Scratch  you can create something called a variable. I'll call it score. And that creates some new blocks for you  and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score  so each time I click on  change score   it increments the score. So I showed this to the clubhouse member    let's call him Victor    and Victor  when he saw that this block would let him increment the score  he knew exactly what to do. He took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish. So then  each time the big fish eats the little fish  he will increment the score  and the score will go up by one. And it's in fact working. And he saw this  and he was so excited  he reached his hand out to me  and he said   Thank you  thank you  thank you.  And what went through my mind was  how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students for teaching them variables   Laughter  It doesn't happen in most classrooms  but that's because in most classrooms  when kids learn about variables  they don't know why they're learning it. It's nothing that  really  they can make use of. When you learn ideas like this in Scratch  you can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you  that you can understand the reason for learning variables  and we see that kids learn it more deeply and learn it better. Victor had  I'm sure  been taught about variables in schools  but he really didn't    he wasn't paying attention. Now he had a reason for learning variables. So when you learn through coding  and coding to learn  you're learning it in a meaningful context  and that's the best way of learning things. So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this  they're learning important concepts like variables  but that's just the start. As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts  he was also learning about the process of design  how to start with the glimmer of an idea and turn it into a fully fledged  functioning project like you see here. So he was learning many different core principles of design  about how to experiment with new ideas  how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts  how to collaborate with other people on your projects  about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong  how to keep persistent and to persevere in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well. Now those are important skills that aren't just relevant for coding. They're relevant for all sorts of different activities. Now  who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become a programmer or a professional computer scientist  It's probably not so likely  but regardless of what he does  he'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned. Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager or a mechanic or a community organizer  that these ideas are useful for everybody. Again  it's useful to think about this analogy with language. When you become fluent with reading and writing  it's not something that you're doing just to become a professional writer. Very few people become professional writers. But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write. Again  the same thing with coding. Most people won't grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers  but those skills of thinking creatively  reasoning systematically  working collaboratively    skills you develop when you code in Scratch    are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives. And it's not just about your work life. Coding can also enable you to express your ideas and feelings in your personal life. Let me end with just one more example. So this is an example that came from after I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom  she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch. So she made this project for my birthday and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card. Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design  and you can rest assured that my    year old mom is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist. But working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity and developing new ways of expressing herself. So as we take a look and we see that Michael Bloomberg is learning to code  all of the children of Estonia learn to code  even my mom has learned to code  don't you think it's about time that you might be thinking about learning to code  If you're interested in giving it a try  I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website. It's scratch.mit.edu  and give a try at coding. Thanks very much.  Applause  Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other    Is that person dangerous  Are they attractive  Are they a potential mate  Are they a potential networking opportunity  We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them. What's your name  Where are you from  How old are you  What do you do  Then we get more personal with it. Have you ever had any diseases  Have you ever been divorced  Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now  What are you into  Who are you into  What gender do you like to sleep with  I get it. We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves. We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough to know what acceptance feels like. We bond together based on anything that we can    music preference  race  gender  the block that we grew up on. We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices. Sometimes  though  just the question  what do you do   can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it. Because the categories  I've found  are too limiting. The boxes are too narrow. And this can get really dangerous. So here's a disclaimer about me  though  before we get too deep into this. I grew up in a very sheltered environment. I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early     s  two blocks from the epicenter of punk music. I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously based upbringing. Where I come from  if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind  you were the weirdo. It was an unorthodox upbringing  but as a kid on the streets of New York  you learn how to trust your own instincts  you learn how to go with your own ideas. So when I was six  I decided that I wanted to be a boy. I went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them. They said they wouldn't let girls play. So I went home  and I shaved my head  and I came back the next day and I said   I'm a boy.  I mean  who knows  right  When you're six  maybe you can do that. I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl  and they didn't. I kept up the charade for eight years. So this is me when I was   . I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called  Julian Po.  I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him. See  I was also a child actor  which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity  because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy. In fact  no one in my life knew that I was a girl    not my teachers at school  not my friends  not the directors that I worked with. Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with. When I would go to the bathroom  I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up. At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me without outing myself. It's worth mentioning though that I didn't hate my body or my genitalia. I didn't feel like I was in the wrong body. I felt like I was performing this elaborate act. I wouldn't have qualified as transgender. If my family  though  had been the kind of people to believe in therapy  they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty. But in my particular case  I just woke up one day when I was     and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again. Puberty had hit  and I had no idea what being a girl meant  and I was ready to figure out who I actually was. When a kid behaves like I did  they don't exactly have to come out  right  No one is exactly shocked. But I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents. When I was     and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love  it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl. Three years later  when I fell in love with a man  neither of my parents batted an eyelash either. See  it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn't ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point. I was just allowed to be me  growing and changing in every moment. So four  almost five years ago  Proposition    the great marriage equality debate  was raising a lot of dust around this country. And at the time  getting married wasn't really something I spent a lot of time thinking about. But I was struck by the fact that America  a country with such a tarnished civil rights record  could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly. And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country  between places where people believed in it and places where people didn't. And then  that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me. If this was a war with two disparate sides  I  by default  fell on team gay  because I certainly wasn't     percent straight. At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy  over compensating  boy chasing girly girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was  a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person. I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls  much like myself  who fell kind of between the lines    girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear  girls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish  girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees  girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything. I loved these people  and I admired their freedom  but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television. And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority  and in my own home country  based on one facet of my character. I was legally and indisputably a second class citizen. I was not an activist. I wave no flags in my own life. But I was plagued by this question  How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character  How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else  Were we even a group  What group  And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination  Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was  And then it occurred to me  perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do. It might give them pause. Obviously I couldn't get    million people to the same dinner party  so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice  without any lighting  or without any manipulation of any kind on my part. Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off. For me  photography is not just about exposing film  it's about exposing the viewer to something new  a place they haven't gone before  but most importantly  to people that they might be afraid of. Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant  far off cultures they never knew existed through pictures. So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits  mugshots if you will. And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not     percent straight  which  if you don't know  is a limitless number of people. So this was a very large undertaking  and to do it we needed some help. So I ran out in the freezing cold  and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago. And I took those photographs  and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help. And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York. And then we made this. Video  I'm iO Tillett Wright  and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City. Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today. My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who's anything other than     percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way. My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face.  We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal.  It's written in the Declaration of Independence. We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded. There is no equality in the United States.   What does equality mean to you      Marriage     Freedom     Civil rights     Treat every person as you'd treat yourself   It's when you don't have to think about it  simple as that. The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage. Today in    states  more than half of this country  you can legally be fired just for your sexuality.   Who is responsible for equality    I've heard hundreds of people give the same answer   We are all responsible for equality.  So far we've shot     faces in New York City. And we wouldn't have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign. I want to take the project across the country. I want to visit    American cities  and I want to shoot       or       people. This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation. I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being.   Self evident truths           faces across America   iO Tillett Wright  Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that. Almost        people watched that video  and then they started emailing us from all over the country  asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces. And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated. So I changed my immediate goal to        faces. That video was made in the spring of       and as of today I have traveled to almost    cities and photographed almost       people. I know that this is a talk  but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them. Because if a picture is worth a thousand words  then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary. So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small town Texas  we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on. Visibility really is key. Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy. Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family  you're far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it. Of course  in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight  but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian. Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths. But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting  Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us. In fact  on the contrary  it highlights them. It presents  not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings  but the complexities found within each individual person. It wasn't that we had too many boxes  it was that we had too few. At some point I realized that my mission to photograph  gays  was inherently flawed  because there were a million different shades of gay. Here I was trying to help  and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid    yet another box. At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to     percent gay. And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me. People didn't know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before. Can you quantify your openness  Once they got over the shock  though  by and large people opted for somewhere between    to    percent or the   to    percent marks. Of course  there were lots of people who opted for a     percent one or the other  but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced. I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as  Grey.  Let me be clear though    and this is very important    in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist. And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative  because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice  I invite you to go out and try to be grey. I'll take your picture just for trying. What I am saying though is that human beings are not one dimensional. The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this  If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here  and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another  there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between. And the reality that this presents is a complicated one. Because  for example  if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior  where exactly do you draw the line  Is it over here  by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far  Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far  Where exactly does one become a second class citizen  Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is. After traveling so much and meeting so many people  let me tell you  there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race. Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs  and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle  just being other than straight doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common. So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming  as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms  bus shelters  billboards  Facebook pages  screen savers  perhaps in watching this procession of humanity  something interesting and useful will begin to happen. Hopefully these categories  these binaries  these over simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away. Because really  they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are. What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity. And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity. At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights. So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing  the right to adopt children  the right to marriage  the freedom to shop here  live here  buy here  Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father  your neighbor  your cousin  your uncle  the president  your police woman or the fireman  It's too late. Because I already am all of those things. We already are all of those things  and we always have been. So please don't greet us as strangers  greet us as your fellow human beings  period. Thank you. Salaam alaikum. Welcome to Doha. I am in charge of making this country's food secure. That is my job for the next two years  to design an entire master plan  and then for the next    years to implement it    of course  with so many other people. But first  I need to talk to you about a story  which is my story  about the story of this country that you're all here in today. And of course  most of you have had three meals today  and probably will continue to have after this event. So going in  what was Qatar in the     s  We were about        people living here. There was no water. There was no energy  no oil  no cars  none of that. Most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages  fishing  or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water. None of the glamour that you see today existed. No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh. It wasn't that they couldn't develop cities. Resources weren't there to develop them. And you can see that life expectancy was also short. Most people died around the age of   . So let's move to chapter two  the oil era.       that's when they discovered oil. But unfortunately  it wasn't really fully exploited commercially until after the Second World War. What did it do  It changed the face of this country  as you can see today and witness. It also made all those people who roamed around the desert    looking for water  looking for food  trying to take care of their livestock    urbanize. You might find this strange  but in my family we have different accents. My mother has an accent that is so different to my father  and we're all a population of about         people in the same country. There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak. Someone says   How so  How could this happen   Because we lived scattered. We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources. And when the resources came  be it oil  we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration. People started to get to know each other. And we realized that there are some differences in accents. So that is the chapter two  the oil era. Let's look at today. This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha. So what's the population today  It's  .  million people. That is in less than    years. The average growth of our economy is about    percent for the past five years. Lifespan has increased to   . Water consumption has increased to     liters. And this is amongst the highest worldwide. From having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree  higher than any other nation. I don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water. But what is interesting about the story that I've just said  The interesting part is that we continue to grow    percent every year for the past five years without water. Now that is historic. It's never happened before in history. Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water. This is history being made in this region. Not only cities that we're building  but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists  doctors. Build a nice home  bring the architect  design my house. These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't. But of course  with the use of technology. So Brazil has       millimeters per year of precipitation of rain. Qatar has     and we have that growth rate. The question is how. How could we survive that  We have no water whatsoever. Simply because of this gigantic  mammoth machine called desalination. Energy is the key factor here. It changed everything. It is that thing that we pump out of the ground  we burn tons of  probably most of you used it coming to Doha. So that is our lake  if you can see it. That is our river. That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water. This is the best technology that this region could ever have  desalination. So what are the risks  Do you worry much  I would say  perhaps if you look at the global facts  you will realize  of course I have to worry. There is growing demand  growing population. We've turned seven billion only a few months ago. And so that number also demands food. And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by     . So a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders. There's also changing diets. By elevating to a higher socio economic level  they also change their diet. They start eating more meat and so on and so forth. On the other hand  there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors. And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen. This is the situation in Qatar  for those who don't know. We only have two days of water reserve. We import    percent of our food  and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land. The limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions  etc.  etc. So we also face risks. These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity. The question is  is there a solution  Is there a sustainable solution  Indeed there is. This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we've been working on over the past two years. Let's start with the water. So we know very well    I showed you earlier    that we need this energy. So if we're going to need energy  what sort of energy  A depletable energy  Fossil fuel  Or should we use something else  Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy  I guess most of you by now realize that we do      days of sun. And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need. And we will probably put       megawatts of solar systems to produce  .  million cubic meters of water. And that is a lot of water. That water will go then to the farmers  and the farmers will be able to water their plants  and they will be able then to supply society with food. But in order to sustain the horizontal line    because these are the projects  these are the systems that we will deliver    we need to also develop the vertical line  system sustenance  high level education  research and development  industries  technologies  to produce these technologies for application  and finally markets. But what gels all of it  what enables it  is legislation  policies  regulations. Without it we can't do anything. So that's what we are planning to do. Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation. Our objective is to be a millennium city  just like many millennium cities around  Istanbul  Rome  London  Paris  Damascus  Cairo. We are only    years old  but we want to live forever as a city  to live in peace. Thank you very much. I have never  ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile   Son  resist Gaddafi. Fight him. But don't you ever turn into a Gaddafi like revolutionary.  Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out  inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions. I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi. And there it was  a great revolution. Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime  raising slogans of freedom  dignity  social justice. They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi. They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south. Eventually  after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost        dead  we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant. However  Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden  a legacy of tyranny  corruption and seeds of diversions. For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society. Aware of the devastation and the challenges  I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society  calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation. Almost     organizations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi    almost     in Tripoli. After a period of    years in exile  I went back to Libya  and with unique enthusiasm  I started organizing workshops on capacity building  on human development of leadership skills. With an amazing group of women  I co founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace  a movement of women  leaders  from different walks of life  to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace. I met a very difficult environment in the pre elections  an environment which was increasingly polarized  an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion. I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law  a law that would give every citizen  no matter what your background  the right to vote and run  and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists  creating the zipper list. Eventually  our initiative was adopted and successful. Women won   .  percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in    years. However  bit by bit  the euphoria of the elections  and of the revolution as a whole  was fading out    for every day we were waking up to the news of violence. One day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs. On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate. On another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers. And every day  every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law. Our society  shaped by a revolutionary mindset  became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles    freedom  dignity  social justice    that we first held. Intolerance  exclusion and revenge became the icons of the  aftermath  of the revolution. I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections. I'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice  made the wrong decision. We did not prioritize right. For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya. Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation  No  it didn't. What is it  then  Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion  by both men and women  Maybe what was missing was not the women only  but the feminine values of compassion  mercy and inclusion. Our society needs national dialogue and consensus building more than it needed the elections  which only reinforced polarization and division. Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical  quantitative representation of the feminine. We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage. We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy. We need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge  collaboration instead of competition  inclusion instead of exclusion. These are the ideals that a war torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace. For peace has an alchemy  and this alchemy is about the intertwining  the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives. That's the real zipper. And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically. According to a Quranic verse  Salam     peace     is the word of the all merciful God  raheem.  In turn  the word  raheem   which is known in all Abrahamic traditions  has the same root in Arabic as the word  rahem     womb    symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female  from which all tribes  all peoples  have emanated from. And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo  which grows within it  the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence. Thus we are told that  My mercy encompasses all things.  Thus we are told that  My mercy takes precedence over my anger.  May we all be granted a grace of mercy. Thank you. Let me tell you a story. It's my first year as a new high school science teacher  and I'm so eager. I'm so excited  I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans. But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything. This happens one day  I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology  viruses and how they attack. And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them  and I come in and I say   Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool   There's silence. Finally  my favorite student  she looks me straight in the eye  and she says   The reading sucked.  And then she clarified. She said   You know what  I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it. It's boring. Um  who cares  and it sucks.  These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now  and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat  that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook  but not one of them really understood the main ideas. Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool  why it's so important. I'm totally clueless. I have no idea what to do next. So the only thing I can think of is say   Listen. Let me tell you a story. The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses. These guys are blown up a couple million times. The real bacteria and viruses are so small we can't see them without a microscope  and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick. But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick.  Now  the story that I start telling my kids  it starts out like a horror story. Once upon a time there's this happy little bacterium. Don't get too attached to him. Maybe he's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere  and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good. Maybe he ate something bad for lunch  and then things get really horrible  as his skin rips apart  and he sees a virus coming out from his insides. And then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides. If    Ouch is right     If you see this  and you're a bacterium  this is like your worst nightmare. But if you're a virus and you see this  you cross those little legs of yours and you think   We rock.  Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium. Here's what had to happen. A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it. The next thing is  that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA. And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA  the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses. Because  you see  DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make. So this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots. The workers still come the next day  they do their job  but they're following different instructions. So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses    that is  until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts. But that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria. Some are much more crafty. When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium  they do a little espionage. Here  this cloaked  secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell  but here's the kicker  It doesn't do anything harmful    not at first. Instead  it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA  and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell  waiting for instructions. And what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies  the babies also have the virus DNA in them. So now we have a whole extended bacteria family  filled with virus sleeper cells. They're just happily living together until a signal happens and    BAM     all of the DNA pops out. It takes control of these cells  turns them into virus making factories  and they all burst  a huge  extended bacteria family  all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts  the viruses taking over the bacterium. So now you understand how viruses can attack cells. There are two ways  On the left is what we call the lytic way  where the viruses go right in and take over the cells. On the  right  is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses. So this stuff is not that hard  right  And now all of you understand it. But if you've graduated from high school  I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before. But I bet it was presented in a way that it didn't exactly stick in your mind. So when my students were first learning this  why did they hate it so much  Well  there were a couple of reasons. First of all  I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn't have secret agent viruses  and they didn't have horror stories. You know  in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness. It kills me. I'm not kidding. I used to work for an educational publisher  and as a writer  I was always told never to use stories or fun  engaging language  because then my work might not be viewed as  serious  and  scientific.  Right  I mean  because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science. So we have this field of science that's all about slime  and color changes. Check this out. And then we have  of course  as any good scientist has to have  explosions  But if a textbook seems too much fun  it's somehow unscientific. Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible. If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier  we could start by saying something like   These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium.  The way this showed up in the textbook  it looked like this   Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium.  That's great  perfect for    year olds. But here's the thing. There are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there's no way that we could ever give that to students  because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate. For example  I told you that viruses have DNA. Well  a very tiny fraction of them don't. They have something called RNA instead. So a professional science writer would circle that and say   That has to go. We have to change it to something much more technical.  And after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation  they'd find fault with almost every word I've used  and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough  and they'd have to change everything that wasn't     percent perfect. Then it would be accurate  but it would be completely impossible to understand. This is horrifying. You know  I keep talking about this idea of telling a story  and it's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision  where you can't just tell a story. It's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know  who gives us all the details nobody cares about  where you're like   Oh  I met my friend for lunch the other day  and she was wearing these ugly jeans. I mean  they weren't really jeans  they were more kind of  like  leggings  but  like  I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings  like  but I think     and you're just like   Oh my God. What is the point   Or even worse  science education is becoming like that guy who always says   Actually.  Right  You want to be like   Oh  dude  we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness.  And that guy's like   Actually  it was   .  miles.  And you're like   Actually  shut up  I'm just trying to tell a story.  Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection. We have to convince our audience that what we're talking about matters. But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across. I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said  and I paraphrase  when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth. I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education. Now  finally  I am often so disappointed when people think that I'm advocating a dumbing down of science. That's not true at all. I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT  and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed  specific scientific communication between experts  but not when we're trying to teach    year olds. If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA  that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science. But if a young learner can't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this  that will ruin their chances of success. This needs to stop  and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems  and I beg them  I beseech them to just stop it. But I think that's unlikely. So we are so lucky that we have resources like the Internet  where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up. There's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple  understandable ways. I dream of a Wikipedia like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand. And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube. I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances  and I talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp. The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it's often written in LOLcats  but nonetheless it's so appreciative  so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science. There's still so much work left to be done  though  and if you're involved with science in any way I urge you to join me. Pick up a camera  start to write a blog  whatever  but leave out the seriousness  leave out the jargon. Make me laugh. Make me care. Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point. How should you start  Why don't you say   Listen  let me tell you a story   Thank you. So  I'm an artist. I live in New York  and I've been working in advertising for    ever since I left school  so about seven  eight years now  and it was draining. I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends  and I found myself never having time for all the projects that I wanted to work on on my own. And one day I was at work and I saw a talk by Stefan Sagmeister on TED  and it was called  The power of time off   and he spoke about how every seven years  he takes a year off from work so he could do his own creative projects  and I was instantly inspired  and I just said   I have to do that. I have to take a year off. I need to take time to travel and spend time with my family and start my own creative ideas.  So the first of those projects ended up being something I called  One Second Every Day.  Basically I'm recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life  chronologically compiling these one second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until  you know  I can't record them anymore. The purpose of this project is  one  I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past. There's all these things that I've done with my life that I have no recollection of unless someone brings it up  and sometimes I think   Oh yeah  that's something that I did.  And something that I realized early on in the project was that if I wasn't doing anything interesting  I would probably forget to record the video. So the day    the first time that I forgot  it really hurt me  because it's something that I really wanted to    from the moment that I turned     I wanted to keep this project going until forever  and having missed that one second  I realized  it just kind of created this thing in my head where I never forgot ever again. So if I live to see    years of age  I'm going to have a five hour video that encapsulates    years of my life. When I turn     I'll have a one hour video that includes just my   s. This has really invigorated me day to day  when I wake up  to try and do something interesting with my day. Now  one of the things that I have issues with is that  as the days and weeks and months go by  time just seems to start blurring and blending into each other and  you know  I hated that  and visualization is the way to trigger memory. You know  this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done. Even just this one second allows me to remember everything else I did that one day. It's difficult  sometimes  to pick that one second. On a good day  I'll have maybe three or four seconds that I really want to choose  but I'll just have to narrow it down to one  but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway. It's also kind of a protest  a personal protest  against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert  and they're disturbing you. They're not even enjoying the show. They're watching the concert through their cell phone. I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit  back in the day  and I've decided that the best way for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life and not be that person  is to just record that one second that will allow me to trigger that memory of   Yeah  that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert.  And it just takes a quick  quick second. I was on a three month road trip this summer. It was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life  just driving around the U.S. and Canada and just figuring out where to go the next day  and it was kind of outstanding. I actually ran out  I spent too much money on my road trip for the savings that I had to take my year off  so I had to  I went to Seattle and I spent some time with friends working on a really neat project. One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family  and this really tragic thing happened where my sister in law  her intestine suddenly strangled one day  and we took her to the emergency room  and she was  she was in really bad shape. We almost lost her a couple of times  and I was there with my brother every day. It helped me realize something else during this project  is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult. It's not    we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things. Or we're   Oh  yeah  this party  let me take a picture.  But we rarely do that when we're having a bad day  and something horrible is happening. And I found that it's actually been very  very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment. It really helps you appreciate the good times. It's not always a good day  so when you have a bad one  I think it's important to remember it  just as much as it is important to remember the  good  days. Now one of the things that I do is I don't use any filters  I don't use anything to    I try to capture the moment as much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes. I started a rule of first person perspective. Early on  I think I had a couple of videos where you would see me in it  but I realized that wasn't the way to go. The way to really remember what I saw was to record it as I actually saw it. Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are  wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this  I turned    last week  which is there. I think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this. I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it. I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day. Personally  I'm tired of forgetting  and this is a really easy thing to do. I mean  we all have HD capable cameras in our pockets right now    most people in this room  I bet    and it's something that's    I never want to forget another day that I've ever lived  and this is my way of doing that  and it'd be really interesting also to see  if you could just type in on a website   June            and you would just see a stream of people's lives on that particular day from all over the world. And I don't know  I think this project has a lot of possibilities  and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day  so you can never forget that that day  you lived. Thank you. Organic chemists make molecules  very complicated molecules  by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering. And as a chemist  one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is  could we make a really cool universal chemistry set  In essence  could we  app  chemistry  Now what would this mean  and how would we do it  Well to start to do this  we took a  D printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware. And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time  we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry. Now what could this mean  Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine  so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill  if you have this embedded in your device at the same time  and you do the chemistry  you may be able to make drugs in a new way. So how are we doing this in the lab  Well it requires software  it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks. And so the really cool bit is  the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer  and you download the blueprint  the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device. And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software. So what could this mean  Well  ultimately  it could mean that you could print your own medicine. And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment. But to take baby steps to get there  first of all we want to look at drug design and production  or drug discovery and manufacturing. Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it  we could deploy it anywhere. You don't need to go to the chemist anymore. We can print drugs at point of need. We can download new diagnostics. Say a new super bug has emerged. You put it in your search engine  and you create the drug to treat the threat. So this allows you on the fly molecular assembly. But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells  with your genes and your environment  and you print your own personal medicine. And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough  where do you think we're going to go  Well  you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator. Beam me up  Scotty. In my previous life  I was an artist. I still paint. I love art. I love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities  and I try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics  and I see part of my job today  the reason for being here  not just to campaign for my party  but for politics  and the role it can play for the better in our lives. For    years  I was mayor of Tirana  our capital. We faced many challenges. Art was part of the answer  and my name  in the very beginning  was linked with two things  demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back  and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city. But this use of colors was not just an artistic act. Rather  it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget I had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something. When we painted the first building  by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of a facade  something unimaginable happened. There was a traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident  or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star. The French E.U. official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting. He screeched that he would block the financing.  But why   I asked him.  Because the colors you have ordered do not meet European standards   he replied.  Well   I told him   the surroundings do not meet European standards  even though this is not what we want  but we will choose the colors ourselves  because this is exactly what we want. And if you do not let us continue with our work  I will hold a press conference here  right now  right in this road  and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era.  Then he was kind of troubled  and asked me for a compromise. But I told him no  I'm sorry  compromise in colors is gray  and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime. So it's time for change. The rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost. The pride of people about their own place of living  and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal  barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space. And when colors came out everywhere  a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people. Big noise raised up   What is this  What is happening  What are colors doing to us   And we made a poll  the most fascinating poll I've seen in my life. We asked people   Do you want this action  and to have buildings painted like that   And then the second question was   Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue   To the first question     percent of people said yes  we like it. Thirty seven said no  we don't like it. But to the second question  half of them that didn't like it  they wanted it to continue.  Laughter  So we noticed change. People started to drop less litter in the streets  for example  started to pay taxes  started to feel something they had forgotten  and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police  or the state itself  were missing. One day I remember walking along a street that had just been colored  and where we were in the process of planting trees  when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop. They had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place.  Why did you throw away the shutters   I asked him.  Well  because the street is safer now   they answered.  Safer  Why  They have posted more policemen here    Come on  man  What policemen  You can see it for yourself. There are colors  streetlights  new pavement with no potholes  trees. So it's beautiful  it's safe.  And indeed  it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected. And this was not a misplaced feeling. Crime did fall. The freedom that was won in      brought about a state of anarchy in the city  while the barbarism of the '  s brought about a loss of hope for the city. The paint on the walls did not feed children  nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant  but it gave hope and light  and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things  a different spirit  a different feel to our lives  and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics  we could build a better life for each other and for our country. We removed         tons of concrete only from the riverbanks. We demolished more than       illegal buildings all over the city  up to eight stories high  the tallest of them. We planted        trees and bushes in the streets. We established a green tax  and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly. By means of open competitions  we managed to recruit in our administration many young people  and we thus managed to build a de politicized public institution where men and women were equally represented. International organizations have invested a lot in Albania during these    years  not all of it well spent. When I told the World Bank directors that I wanted them to finance a project to build a model reception hall for citizens precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption  they did not understand me. But people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks. They were paying in order to skip the queue  the long queue. The reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole  and  on the other hand  a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe. We could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks  every week  but we could not change this corrupt practice.  I'm convinced   I told a German official with the World Bank   that it would be impossible for them to be bribed if they worked in Germany  in a German administration  just as I am convinced that if you put German officials from the German administration in those holes  they would be bribed just the same.  It's not about genes. It's not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience. It's about system  it's about organization. It's also about environment and respect. We removed the kiosks. We built the bright new reception hall that made people  Tirana citizens  think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests. We created an online system of control and so speeded up all the processes. We put the citizen first  and not the clerks. The corruption in the state administration of countries like Albania    it's not up to me to say also like Greece    can be fought only by modernization. Reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself is the answer  and not reinventing people based on a ready made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose to people like us. Things have come to this point because politicians in general  but especially in our countries  let's face it  think people are stupid. They take it for granted that  come what may  people have to follow them  while politics  more and more  fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people. Politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians  while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation. Seen from those stairs  all politicians today seem the same  and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism. Barack Obama won    Applause    because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks. He did not know each and every one of them  but with an admirable ingenuity  he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign. I tweet. I love it. I love it because it lets me get the message out  but it also lets people get their messages to me. This is politics  not from top down  but from the bottom up  and sideways  and allowing everybody's voice to be heard is exactly what we need. Politics is not just about leaders. It's not just about politicians and laws. It is about how people think  how they view the world around them  how they use their time and their energy. When people say all politicians are the same  ask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush  if Fran ois Hollande is the same as Sarkozy. They are not. They are human beings with different views and different visions for the world. When people say nothing can change  just stop and think what the world was like                 years ago. Our world is defined by the pace of change. We can all change the world. I gave you a very small example of how one thing  the use of color  can make change happen. I want to make more change as Prime Minister of my country  but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to. President Roosevelt  he said   Believe you can  and you are halfway there.  Efharisto and kalinihta. When I was     I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house. My father was listening to BBC News on his small  gray radio. There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then  because the news mostly depressed him.  The Taliban are gone   my father shouted. I didn't know what it meant  but I could see that my father was very  very happy.  You can go to a real school now   he said. A morning that I will never forget. A real school. You see  I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school. So for the next five years  I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister  who was no longer allowed to be outside alone  to a secret school. It was the only way we both could be educated. Each day  we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going. We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping. The school was in a house  more than     of us packed in one small living room. It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer. We all knew we were risking our lives    the teacher  the students and our parents. From time to time  the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious. We always wondered what they knew about us. Were we being followed  Do they know where we live  We were scared  but still  school was where we wanted to be. I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured. My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time. A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan  he insisted that his daughter  my mom  go to school  and for that he was disowned by his father. But my educated mother became a teacher. There she is. She retired two years ago  only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood. And my father    that's him    he was the first ever in his family to receive an education. There was no question that his children would receive an education  including his daughters  despite the Taliban  despite the risks. To him  there was greater risk in not educating his children. During Taliban years  I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future. I would want to quit  but my father  he would say   Listen  my daughter  you can lose everything you own in your life. Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war. But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here  and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees  we will. So do you still not want to continue   Today I am   . I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war. Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school  and had my family not been so committed to my education  I would be one of them. Instead  I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College. When I returned to Afghanistan  my grandfather  the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters  was among the first to congratulate me. He not only brags about my college degree  but also that I was the first woman  and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul. My family believes in me. I dream big  but my family dreams even bigger for me. That's why I am a global ambassador for   x    a global campaign to educate women. That's why I cofounded SOLA  the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan  a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school. The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity. And I see their parents and their fathers who  like my own  advocate for them  despite and even in the face of daunting opposition. Like Ahmed. That's not his real name  and I cannot show you his face  but Ahmed is the father of one of my students. Less than a month ago  he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village  and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes. As he arrived home  the phone rang  a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school  they would try again.  Kill me now  if you wish   he said   but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas.  What I've come to realize about Afghanistan  and this is something that is often dismissed in the West  that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success. It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success. In fact  they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters  but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan  we must have the support of men. Under the Taliban  girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds    remember  it was illegal. But today  more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan. Afghanistan looks so different from here in America. I find that Americans see the fragility in changes. I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal. But when I am back in Afghanistan  when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them  who encourage them  I see a promising future and lasting change. To me  Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities  and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that. Like me  they are dreaming big. Thank you. You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road. It's made of asphalt  and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on  but not always  especially not on these days as today  when it's raining a lot. Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt. And especially if you then ride with your bicycle  and pass these cars  then that's not very nice. Also  asphalt can create a lot of noise. It's a noisy material  and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands  very close to cities  then we would like a silent road. The solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt. Porous asphalt  a material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands  it has pores and water can just rain through it  so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides  and you have a road that's easy to drive on  so no splash water anymore. Also the noise will disappear in these pores. Because it's very hollow  all the noise will disappear  so it's a very silent road. It also has disadvantages  of course  and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur. What is raveling  You see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off. First you get one stone  then several more  and more and more and more and more  and then they    well  I will not do that.  Laughter  But they can damage your windshield  so you're not happy with that. And finally  this raveling can also lead to more and more damage. Sometimes you can create potholes with that. Ha. He's ready. Potholes  of course  that can become a problem  but we have a solution. Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material. It's a porous asphalt  like I said  so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones. Due to weathering  due to U.V. light  due to oxidation  this binder  this bitumen  the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink  and if it shrinks  it gets micro cracks  and it delaminates from the aggregates. Then if you drive over the road  you take out the aggregates    what we just saw here. To solve this problem  we thought of self healing materials. If we can make this material self healing  then probably we have a solution. So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans  and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces  and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen. So then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it. Then you need a machine  like you see here  that you can use for cooking    an induction machine. Induction can heat  especially steel  it's very good at that. Then what you do is you heat up the steel  you melt the bitumen  and the bitumen will flow into these micro cracks  and the stones are again fixed to the surface. Today I use a microwave because I cannot take the big induction machine here onstage. So a microwave is a similar system. So I put the specimen in  which I'm now going to take out to see what happened. So this is the specimen coming out now. So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens. We tested a lot of specimens there  and then the government  they actually saw our results  and they thought   Well  that's very interesting. We have to try that.  So they donated to us a piece of highway      meters of the A    where we had to make a test track to test this material. So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road  and then of course this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know from practice. So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab. So we did aging on the samples  did a lot of loading on it  healed them with our induction machine  and healed them and tested them again. Several times we can repeat that. So actually  the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine    this is the big version we have made to go on the real road    if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road  which of course saves a lot of money. Well  to conclude  I can say that we made a material using steel fibers  the addition of steel fibers  using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road  double the surface life you can even do  so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks. And now you're of course curious if it also worked. So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm. Actually  it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works. But I will do a trial. Let's see. Yeah  it worked. Thank you.  When the crisis came  the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent.   There is also a strong belief  which I share  that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics helped create the crisis.  Now  you've probably all heard of similar criticism coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism. But this is different. This is coming from the heart of finance. The first quote is from Jean Claude Trichet when he was governor of the European Central Bank. The second quote is from the head of the U.K. Financial Services Authority. Are these people implying that we don't understand the economic systems that drive our modern societies  It gets worse.  We spend billions of dollars trying to understand the origins of the universe while we still don't understand the conditions for a stable society  a functioning economy  or peace.  What's happening here  How can this be possible  Do we really understand more about the fabric of reality than we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions  Unfortunately  the answer is yes. But there's an intriguing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity. To explain what this means and what this thing is  please let me quickly take a couple of steps back. I ended up in physics by accident. It was a random encounter when I was young  and since then  I've often wondered about the amazing success of physics in describing the reality we wake up in every day. In a nutshell  you can think of physics as follows. So you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics. You encode it into equations. Then predictions can be made and tested. We're actually really lucky that this works  because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe. Despite the success  physics has its limits. As Dirk Helbing pointed out in the last quote  we don't really understand the complexity that relates to us  that surrounds us. This paradox is what got me interested in complex systems. So these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts  swarms of birds or fish  ant colonies  ecosystems  brains  financial markets. These are just a few examples. Interestingly  complex systems are very hard to map into mathematical equations  so the usual physics approach doesn't really work here. So what do we know about complex systems  Well  it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction. This means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions  so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions. And it gets even better  because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence. So this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system. So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts. And all of this also means that you can forget about the individual parts of the system  how complex they are. So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird  you just focus on the rules of interaction. As a result  networks are ideal representations of complex systems. The nodes in the network are the system's components and the links are given by the interactions. So what equations are for physics  complex networks are for the study of complex systems. This approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics  biology  computer science  the social sciences  but what about economics  Where are economic networks  This is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature. The study we published last year called  The Network of Global Corporate Control  was the first extensive analysis of economic networks. The study went viral on the Internet and it attracted a lot of attention from the international media. This is quite remarkable  because  again  why did no one look at this before  Similar data has been around for quite some time. What we looked at in detail was ownership networks. So here the nodes are companies  people  governments  foundations  etc. And the links represent the shareholding relations  so Shareholder A has x percent of the shares in Company B. And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue. So ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations. In this little example  you can see a few financial institutions with some of the many links highlighted. Now you may think that no one's looked at this before because ownership networks are really  really boring to study. Well  as ownership is related to control  as I shall explain later  looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like  who are the key players  How are they organized  Are they isolated  Are they interconnected  And what is the overall distribution of control  In other words  who controls the world  I think this is an interesting question. And it has implications for systemic risk. This is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall. A high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability  because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic. Scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data  because a foundational guideline in science is  Let the data speak. Okay. Let's do that. So we started with a database containing    million ownership relations from     . This is a lot of data  and because we wanted to find out who rules the world  we decided to focus on transnational corporations  or TNCs for short. These are companies that operate in more than one country  and we found       . In the next step  we built the network around these companies  so we took all the TNCs' shareholders  and the shareholders' shareholders  etc.  all the way upstream  and we did the same downstream  and ended up with a network containing         nodes and one million links. This is the TNC network which we analyzed. And it turns out to be structured as follows. So you have a periphery and a center which contains about    percent of all the players  and in the center there's this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies. To give you a better picture  think about a metropolitan area. So you have the suburbs and the periphery  you have a center like a financial district  then the core will be something like the tallest high rise building in the center. And we already see signs of organization going on here. Thirty six percent of the TNCs are in the core only  but they make up    percent of the total operating revenue of all TNCs. Okay  so now we analyzed the structure  so how does this relate to the control  Well  ownership gives voting rights to shareholders. This is the normal notion of control. And there are different models which allow you to compute the control you get from ownership. If you have more than    percent of the shares in a company  you get control  but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares. And the network really matters. About    years ago  Mr. Tronchetti Provera had ownership and control in a small company  which had ownership and control in a bigger company. You get the idea. This ended up giving him control in Telecom Italia with a leverage of   . So this means that  with each euro he invested  he was able to move    euros of market value through the chain of ownership relations. Now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the TNCs' value. This allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder. This is very much in the sense of Max Weber's idea of potential power  which is the probability of imposing one's own will despite the opposition of others. If you want to compute the flow in an ownership network  this is what you have to do. It's actually not that hard to understand. Let me explain by giving you this analogy. So think about water flowing in pipes where the pipes have different thickness. So similarly  the control is flowing in the ownership networks and is accumulating at the nodes. So what did we find after computing all this network control  Well  it turns out that the     top shareholders have the potential to collectively control    percent of the TNCs' value. Now remember  we started out with         nodes  so these     top players make up a bit more than  .  percent. They're mostly financial institutions in the U.S. and the U.K. And it gets even more extreme. There are     top players in the core  and they together have the potential to collectively control    percent of the TNCs' value. What should you take home from all of this  Well  the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard. The high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy and we could easily reproduce the TNC network with a few simple rules. This means that its structure is probably the result of self organization. It's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system  so it's probably not the result of a top down approach like a global conspiracy. Our study  is an impression of the moon's surface. It's not a street map.  So you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt  yet it  gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance.  We hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction  so the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future. And this is slowly starting. We're seeing the emergence of long term and highly funded programs which aim at understanding our networked world from a complexity point of view. But this journey has only just begun  so we will have to wait before we see the first results. Now there is still a big problem  in my opinion. Ideas relating to finance  economics  politics  society  are very often tainted by people's personal ideologies. I really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common ground to be found. It would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas  which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world. Reality is so complex  we need to move away from dogma. But this is just my own personal ideology. Thank you. So  why does good sex so often fade  even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever  And why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex  contrary to popular belief  Or  the next question would be  can we want what we already have  That's the million dollar question  right  And why is the forbidden so erotic  What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent  And why does sex make babies  and babies spell erotic disaster in couples  It's kind of the fatal erotic blow  isn't it  And when you love  how does it feel  And when you desire  how is it different  These are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love. So I travel the globe  and what I'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered  there seems to be a crisis of desire. A crisis of desire  as in owning the wanting    desire as an expression of our individuality  of our free choice  of our preferences  of our identity    desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies. You know  this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term not because we want    children  for which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it  and not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty. This is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire. So what sustains desire  and why is it so difficult  And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship  I think  is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs. On the one hand  our need for security  for predictability  for safety  for dependability  for reliability  for permanence. All these anchoring  grounding experiences of our lives that we call home. But we also have an equally strong need    men and women    for adventure  for novelty  for mystery  for risk  for danger  for the unknown  for the unexpected  surprise    you get the gist. For journey  for travel. So reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship  or what we today like to call a passionate marriage  used to be a contradiction in terms. Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship. But now we want our partner to still give us all these things  but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot  and we live twice as long. So we come to one person  and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide. Give me belonging  give me identity  give me continuity  but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one. Give me comfort  give me edge. Give me novelty  give me familiarity. Give me predictability  give me surprise. And we think it's a given  and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that. So now we get to the existential reality of the story  right  Because I think  in some way    and I'll come back to that    but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination. So why does good sex so often fade  What is the relationship between love and desire  How do they relate  and how do they conflict  Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism. So if there is a verb  for me  that comes with love  it's  to have.  And if there is a verb that comes with desire  it is  to want.  In love  we want to have  we want to know the beloved. We want to minimize the distance. We want to contract that gap. We want to neutralize the tensions. We want closeness. But in desire  we tend to not really want to go back to the places we've already gone. Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest. In desire  we want an Other  somebody on the other side that we can go visit  that we can go spend some time with  that we can go see what goes on in their red light district. You know  In desire  we want a bridge to cross. Or in other words  I sometimes say  fire needs air. Desire needs space. And when it's said like that  it's often quite abstract. But then I took a question with me. And I've gone to more than    countries in the last few years with  Mating in Captivity   and I asked people  when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner  Not attracted sexually  per Se  but most drawn. And across culture  across religion  and across gender    except for one    there are a few answers that just keep coming back. So the first group is  I am most drawn to my partner when she is away  when we are apart  when we reunite. Basically  when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner  when my imagination comes back in the picture  and when I can root it in absence and in longing  which is a major component of desire. But then the second group is even more interesting. I am most drawn to my partner when I see him in the studio  when she is onstage  when he is in his element  when she's doing something she's passionate about  when I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him  when I see her hold court. Basically  when I look at my partner radiant and confident. Probably the biggest turn on across the board. Radiant  as in self sustaining. I look at this person    by the way  in desire people rarely talk about it  when we are blended into one  five centimeters from each other. I don't know in inches how much that is. But it's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them. It's when I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance  where this person that is already so familiar  so known  is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious  somewhat elusive. And in this space between me and the other lies the erotic  lan  lies that movement toward the other. Because sometimes  as Proust says  mystery is not about traveling to new places  but it's about looking with new eyes. And so  when I see my partner on his own or her own  doing something in which they are enveloped  I look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception  and I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me. And then  more importantly  in this description about the other or myself    it's the same    what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire. Nobody needs anybody. There is no caretaking in desire. Caretaking is mightily loving. It's a powerful anti aphrodisiac. I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them. Wanting them is one thing. Needing them is a shot down and women have known that forever  because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge. For good reasons  right  And then the third group of answers usually would be  when I'm surprised  when we laugh together  as somebody said to me in the office today  when he's in his tux  so I said  you know  it's either the tux or the cowboy boots. But basically it's when there is novelty. But novelty isn't about new positions. It isn't a repertoire of techniques. Novelty is  what parts of you do you bring out  What parts of you are just being seen  Because in some way one could say sex isn't something you do  eh  Sex is a place you go. It's a space you enter inside yourself and with another  or others. So where do you go in sex  What parts of you do you connect to  What do you seek to express there  Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union  Is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive  Is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything  Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes  What comes out there  It's a language. It isn't just a behavior. And it's the poetic of that language that I'm interested in  which is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence. You know  animals have sex. It's the pivot  it's biology  it's the natural instinct. We are the only ones who have an erotic life  which means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination. We are the only ones who can make love for hours  have a blissful time  multiple orgasms  and touch nobody  just because we can imagine it. We can hint at it. We don't even have to do it. We can experience that powerful thing called anticipation  which is a mortar to desire. The ability to imagine it  as if it's happening  to experience it as if it's happening  while nothing is happening and everything is happening  at the same time. So when I began to think about eroticism  I began to think about the poetics of sex. And if I look at it as an intelligence  then it's something that you cultivate. What are the ingredients  Imagination  playfulness  novelty  curiosity  mystery. But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination. But more importantly  for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark  what sustains desire  I had to go back to the original definition of eroticism  the mystical definition  and I went through it through a bifurcation by looking  actually  at trauma  which is the other side. And I looked at it  looking at the community that I had grown up in  which was a community in Belgium  all Holocaust survivors  and in my community  there were two groups  those who didn't die  and those who came back to life. And those who didn't die lived often very tethered to the ground  could not experience pleasure  could not trust  because when you're vigilant  worried  anxious  and insecure  you can't lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative. Those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death. They knew how to keep themselves alive. And when I began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that I work with  I sometimes would hear people say   I want more sex   but generally  people want better sex  and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness  of vibrancy  of renewal  of vitality  of Eros  of energy that sex used to afford them  or that they've hoped it would afford them. And so I began to ask a different question.  I shut myself off when ...  began to be the question.  I turn off my desires when ...  Which is not the same question as   What turns me off is ...  and  You turn me off when ...  And people began to say   I turn myself off when I feel dead inside  when I don't like my body  when I feel old  when I haven't had time for myself  when I haven't had a chance to even check in with you  when I don't perform well at work  when I feel low self esteem  when I don't have a sense of self worth  when I don't feel like I have a right to want  to take  to receive pleasure.  And then I began to ask the reverse question.  I turn myself on when ...  Because most of the time  people like to ask the question   You turn me on  what turns me on   and I'm out of the question  you know  Now  if you are dead inside  the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine's. It won't make a dent. There is nobody at the reception desk. So I turn myself on when  I turn on my desires  I wake up when ... Now  in this paradox between love and desire  what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love    mutuality  reciprocity  protection  worry  responsibility for the other    are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire. Because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love  jealousy  possessiveness  aggression  power  dominance  naughtiness  mischief. Basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day. You know  the erotic mind is not very politically correct. If everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses  we wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this. But no  in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don't always know how to bring to the person that we love  because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word  the ability to stay connected to one's self in the presence of another. So I want to draw that little image for you  because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs  we are born with that. Our need for connection  our need for separateness  or our need for security and adventure  or our need for togetherness and for autonomy  and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable  and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore. That's the beginning of desire  that exploratory need  curiosity  discovery. And then at some point they turn around and they look at you. And if you tell them   Hey kiddo  the world's a great place. Go for it. There's so much fun out there   then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time. They can go off in their imagination  off in their body  off in their playfulness  all the while knowing that there's somebody when they come back. But if on this side there is somebody who says   I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed. My partner hasn't taken care of me in so long. What's so good out there  Don't we have everything you need together  you and I   then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize. Some of us will come back  came back a long time ago  and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other. I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection. And I will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection  and I won't know how to leave you in order to go play  in order to go experience pleasure  in order to discover  to enter inside myself. Translate this into adult language. It starts very young. It continues into our sex lives up to the end. Child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time.  Are you going to be there  Are you going to curse me  scold me  Are you going to be angry with me   And they may be gone  but they're never really away. And those are often the people that will tell you   In the beginning  it was super hot.  Because in the beginning  the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire. The more connected I became  the more responsible I felt  the less I was able to let go in your presence. The third child doesn't really come back. So what happens  if you want to sustain desire  it's that real dialectic piece. On the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go. On the other hand if you can't go  you can't have pleasure  you can't culminate  you don't have an orgasm  you don't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own. So in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs  there are a few things that I've come to understand erotic couples do. One  they have a lot of sexual privacy. They understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them. They also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing. Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm. They also understand that an erotic space isn't about  you begin to stroke the other. It's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc.  maybe where you leave the Agile program    And you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible. Responsibility and desire just butt heads. They don't really do well together. Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes. It's pretty much like the moon. It has intermittent eclipses. But what they know is they know how to resurrect it. They know how to bring it back. And they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth  which is the myth of spontaneity  which is that it's just going to fall from heaven while you're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina  and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long term relationship  already has. Committed sex is premeditated sex. It's willful. It's intentional. It's focus and presence. Merry Valentine's. The theme of my talk today is   Be an artist  right now.  Most people  when this subject is brought up  get tense and resist it   Art doesn't feed me  and right now I'm busy. I have to go to school  get a job  send my kids to lessons ...   You think   I'm too busy. I don't have time for art.  There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now. Don't they just pop into your head  There are so many reasons why we can't be  indeed  we're not sure why we should be. We don't know why we should be artists  but we have many reasons why we can't be. Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art  Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained. And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art. Well you might have  but I don't think so. This is the theme of my talk today. We are all born artists. If you have kids  you know what I mean. Almost everything kids do is art. They draw with crayons on the wall. They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV  but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance    it becomes the kids' own dance. So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone. Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear  and because they practice such art all day long  people honestly get a little tired around kids. Kids will sometimes perform monodramas    playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play. And some kids  when they get a bit older  start to lie. Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies. They're shocked.  Now you're showing your true colors   Mom says. She thinks   Why does he take after his dad   She questions him   What kind of a person are you going to be   But you shouldn't worry. The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins. They are talking about things they didn't see. It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment. Parents should celebrate.  Hurray  My boy finally started to lie   All right  It calls for celebration. For example  a kid says   Mom  guess what  I met an alien on my way home.  Then a typical mom responds   Stop that nonsense.  Now  an ideal parent is someone who responds like this   Really  An alien  huh  What did it look like  Did it say anything  Where did you meet it    Um  in front of the supermarket.  When you have a conversation like this  the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started. Soon  a story develops. Of course this is an infantile story  but thinking up one sentence after the next is the same thing a professional writer like me does. In essence  they are not different. Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels   Flaubert did not write a novel. He merely connected one sentence after another. The eros between sentences  that is the essence of Flaubert's novel.  That's right    a novel  basically  is writing one sentence  then  without violating the scope of the first one  writing the next sentence. And you continue to make connections. Take a look at this sentence   One morning  as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams  he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug.  Yes  it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's  The Metamorphosis.  Writing such an unjustifiable sentence and continuing in order to justify it  Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature. Kafka did not show his work to his father. He was not on good terms with his father. On his own  he wrote these sentences. Had he shown his father   My boy has finally lost it   he would've thought. And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts and justifying the next sentence  which is not much different from what a kid does. A kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller. Kids do art. They don't get tired and they have fun doing it. I was in Jeju Island a few days ago. When kids are on the beach  most of them love playing in the water. But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand  making mountains and seas    well  not seas  but different things    people and dogs  etc. But parents tell them   It will all be washed away by the waves.  In other words  it's useless. There's no need. But kids don't mind. They have fun in the moment and they keep playing in the sand. Kids don't do it because someone told them to. They aren't told by their boss or anyone  they just do it. When you were little  I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art. When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment  many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid. Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend  or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots    things like that. Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera. They talk about these kinds of experiences. You must have had such a moment. In that moment  art makes you happy because it's not work. Work doesn't make you happy  does it  Mostly it's tough. The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying. It's a bit mischievous  actually.  Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired.  Right  Why would work tire us if it's in our nature  Playing doesn't tire us. We can play all night long. If we work overnight  we should be paid for overtime. Why  Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue. But kids  usually they do art for fun. It's playing. They don't draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family. Of course  there were kids who had to. You know this gentleman  right  He had to tour around Europe to support his family    Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart    but that was centuries ago  so we can make him an exception. Unfortunately  at some point our art    such a joyful pastime    ends. Kids have to go to lessons  to school  do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons  but they aren't fun anymore. You're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun  If you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall  you'll surely get in trouble with your mom. Besides  if you continue to act like an artist as you get older  you'll increasingly feel pressure    people will question your actions and ask you to act properly. Here's my story  I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung. I was trying my best  and my teacher came around and asked me   What are you doing    I'm drawing diligently   I said.  Why are you using only black   Indeed  I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black. And I explained   It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch.  Then my teacher said   Really  Well  Young ha  you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling.  Or so I wished.  Now you'll get it  you rascal   was the response.  Laughter   You'll get it   he said. You were supposed to draw the palace  the Gyeonghoeru  etc.  but I was coloring everything in black  so he dragged me out of the group. There were a lot of girls there as well  so I was utterly mortified. None of my explanations or excuses were heard  and I really got it big time. If he was an ideal teacher  he would have responded like I said before   Young ha may not have a talent for drawing  but he has a gift for making up stories   and he would have encouraged me. But such a teacher is seldom found. Later  I grew up and went to Europe's galleries    I was a university student    and I thought this was really unfair. Look what I found.  Laughter  Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth. Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper  Contemporary art  I later discovered  isn't explained by a lame story like mine. No crows are brought up. Most of the works have no title  Untitled. Anyways  contemporary art in the   th century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation    essentially the same as I did. Of course  my work was very amateur  but let's turn to more famous examples. This is Picasso's. He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it  Bull's Head.  Sounds convincing  right  Next  a urinal was placed on its side and called  Fountain . That was Duchamp. So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories    that's indeed what contemporary art is all about. Picasso even made the statement   I draw not what I see but what I think.  Yes  it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru. I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher. Unfortunately  the little artists within us are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art. They get locked in. That's our tragedy. So what happens when little artists get locked in  banished or even killed  Our artistic desire doesn't go away. We want to express  to reveal ourselves  but with the artist dead  the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form. In karaoke bars  there are always people who sing  She's Gone  or  Hotel California   miming the guitar riffs. Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed. Some people turn into rockers like this. Or some people dance in clubs. People who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the Internet all night long. That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side. Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots. They go   Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you.  The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else  but the dad alone builds castles. This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed  not gone. But they can often reveal themselves negatively  in the form of jealousy. You know the song  I would love to be on TV   Why would we love it  TV is full of people who do what we wished to do  but never got to. They dance  they act    and the more they do  they are praised. So we start to envy them. We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.  He just can't act.   You call that singing  She can't hit the notes.  We easily say these sorts of things. We get jealous  not because we're evil  but because we have little artists pent up inside us. That's what I think. What should we do then  Yes  that's right. Right now  we need to start our own art. Right this minute  we can turn off TV  log off the Internet  get up and start to do something. Where I teach students in drama school  there's a course called Dramatics. In this course  all students must put on a play. However  acting majors are not supposed to act. They can write the play  for example  and the writers may work on stage art. Likewise  stage art majors may become actors  and in this way you put on a show. Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it  but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play. In school  the military or even in a mental institution  once you make people do it  they enjoy it. I saw this happen in the army    many people had fun doing plays. I have another experience  In my writing class  I give students a special assignment. I have students like you in the class    many who don't major in writing. Some major in art or music and think they can't write. So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme. It can be a simple theme  Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood. There's one condition  You must write like crazy. Like crazy  I walk around and encourage them   Come on  come on   They have to write like crazy for an hour or two. They only get to think for the first five minutes. The reason I make them write like crazy is because when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind  the artistic devil creeps in. This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you can't write   People will laugh at you. This is not good writing  What kind of sentence is this  Look at your handwriting   It will say a lot of things. You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up. The really good writing I've seen in my class was not from the assignments with a long deadline  but from the     to    minute crazy writing students did in front of me with a pencil. The students go into a kind of trance. After    or    minutes  they write without knowing what they're writing. And in this moment  the nagging devil disappears. So I can say this  It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist  but rather  the one reason one must be that makes us artists. Why we cannot be something is not important. Most artists became artists because of the one reason. When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art  enemies appear on the outside. Mostly  they have the faces of our parents.  Laughter  Sometimes they look like our spouses  but they are not your parents or spouses. They are devils. Devils. They came to Earth briefly transformed to stop you from being artistic  from becoming artists. And they have a magic question. When we say   I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center   or  I'd like to learn Italian songs   they ask   Oh  yeah  A play  What for   The magic question is   What for   But art is not for anything. Art is the ultimate goal. It saves our souls and makes us live happily. It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs. So in response to such a pragmatic question  we need to be bold.  Well  just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you   is what you should say.  I'll just go ahead and do it anyway.  The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities  at least one of which is an artist. Once I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat  and in front of me I saw something related to a play. So I asked the driver   What is this   He said it was his profile.  Then what are you   I asked.  An actor   he said. He was a cabby and an actor. I asked   What roles do you usually play   He proudly said he played King Lear. King Lear.  Who is it that can tell me who I am      a great line from King Lear. That's the world I dream of. Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night. Or a cabby and an actor  a banker and a painter  secretly or publicly performing their own arts. In       Martha Graham  the legend of modern dance  came to Korea. The great artist  then in her   s  arrived at Gimpo Airport and a reporter asked her a typical question   What do you have to do to become a great dancer  Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers   Now  she was the master. This photo was taken in      and she was already a celebrated artist. In       she was asked this question. And here's what she answered   Just do it.  Wow. I was touched. Only those three words and she left the airport. That's it. So what should we do now  Let's be artists  right now. Right away. How  Just do it  Thank you. The kind of neuroscience that I do and my colleagues do is almost like the weatherman. We are always chasing storms. We want to see and measure storms    brainstorms  that is. And we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives  but we rarely see or listen to one. So I always like to start these talks by actually introducing you to one of them. Actually  the first time we recorded more than one neuron    a hundred brain cells simultaneously    we could measure the electrical sparks of a hundred cells in the same animal  this is the first image we got  the first    seconds of this recording. So we got a little snippet of a thought  and we could see it in front of us. I always tell the students that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer  because we are dealing with a system that is only comparable in terms of number of cells to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe. And here we are  out of billions of neurons  just recording     years ago  a hundred. We are doing a thousand now. And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature. Because  if you don't know yet  everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms  comes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains and define our memories  our beliefs  our feelings  our plans for the future. Everything that we ever do  everything that every human has ever done  do or will do  requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms. And the sound of a brainstorm  if you've never heard one  is somewhat like this. You can put it louder if you can. My son calls this  making popcorn while listening to a badly tuned A.M. station.  This is a brain. This is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing  your brain will sound like this    my brain  any brain. And what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time is to actually listen to these symphonies  these brain symphonies  and try to extract from them the messages they carry. In particular  about    years ago we created a preparation that we named brain machine interfaces. And you have a scheme here that describes how it works. The idea is  let's have some sensors that listen to these storms  this electrical firing  and see if you can  in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal    about half a second    let's see if we can read these signals  extract the motor messages that are embedded in it  translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time. And see if we can measure how well we can translate that message when we compare to the way the body does that. And if we can actually provide feedback  sensory signals that go back from this robotic  mechanical  computational actuator that is now under the control of the brain  back to the brain  how the brain deals with that  of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery. And that's exactly what we did    years ago. We started with a superstar monkey called Aurora that became one of the superstars of this field. And Aurora liked to play video games. As you can see here  she likes to use a joystick  like any one of us  any of our kids  to play this game. And as a good primate  she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer. So even before a target appears that she's supposed to cross with the cursor that she's controlling with this joystick  Aurora is trying to find the target  no matter where it is. And if she's doing that  because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor  she gets a drop of Brazilian orange juice. And I can tell you  any monkey will do anything for you if you get a little drop of Brazilian orange juice. Actually any primate will do that. Think about that. Well  while Aurora was playing this game  as you saw  and doing a thousand trials a day and getting    percent correct and     milliliters of orange juice  we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head and sending them to a robotic arm that was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making. Because the idea was to actually turn on this brain machine interface and have Aurora play the game just by thinking  without interference of her body. Her brainstorms would control an arm that would move the cursor and cross the target. And to our shock  that's exactly what Aurora did. She played the game without moving her body. So every trajectory that you see of the cursor now  this is the exact first moment she got that. That's the exact first moment a brain intention was liberated from the physical domains of a body of a primate and could act outside  in that outside world  just by controlling an artificial device. And Aurora kept playing the game  kept finding the little target and getting the orange juice that she wanted to get  that she craved for. Well  she did that because she  at that time  had acquired a new arm. The robotic arm that you see moving here    days later  after the first video that I showed to you  is under the control of Aurora's brain and is moving the cursor to get to the target. And Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm  but she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases. She can scratch her back  she can scratch one of us  she can play another game. By all purposes and means  Aurora's brain has incorporated that artificial device as an extension of her body. The model of the self that Aurora had in her mind has been expanded to get one more arm. Well  we did that    years ago. Just fast forward    years. Just last year we realized that you don't even need to have a robotic device. You can just build a computational body  an avatar  a monkey avatar. And you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them  or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar's arms or legs. And what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these avatars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world. And these objects are visually identical  but when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects  they send an electrical message that is proportional to the microtactile texture of the object that goes back directly to the monkey's brain  informing the brain what it is the avatar is touching. And in just four weeks  the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway    like a new sense. And you truly liberate the brain now because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar. And the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain without the interference of the skin. So what you see here is this is the design of the task. You're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets. And he has to select one because only one carries the reward  the orange juice that they want to get. And he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm  an arm that doesn't exist. And that's exactly what they do. This is a complete liberation of the brain from the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task. The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets. And he's sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain. And the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward. The legends that you see in the movie don't appear for the monkey. And by the way  they don't read English anyway  so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position. And yet  they can find them by tactile discrimination  and they can press it and select it. So when we look at the brains of these animals  on the top panel you see the alignment of     cells showing what happens with the brain activity  the electrical storms  of this sample of neurons in the brain when the animal is using a joystick. And that's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows. The basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions. The bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving and the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar. As fast as we can reset our computers  the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool  as if this too was a part of that primate's body. The brain is assimilating that too  as fast as we can measure. So that suggests to us that our sense of self does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies  but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we're commanding with our brains. Our violins  our cars  our bicycles  our soccer balls  our clothing    they all become assimilated by this voracious  amazing  dynamic system called the brain. How far can we take it  Well  in an experiment that we ran a few years ago  we took this to the limit. We had an animal running on a treadmill at Duke University on the East Coast of the United States  producing the brainstorms necessary to move. And we had a robotic device  a humanoid robot  in Kyoto  Japan at ATR Laboratories that was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain  a human brain  or a primate brain. What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke  so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her. So she could be rewarded  not by what her body was doing but for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet controlled by her brain activity. Funny thing  that round trip around the globe took    milliseconds less than it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head  the head of the monkey  and reach its own muscle. The monkey was moving a robot that was six times bigger  across the planet. This is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously. This is CB  fulfilling its dream in Japan under the control of the brain activity of a primate. So where are we taking all this  What are we going to do with all this research  besides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears  Well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world. Millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms into action  into movement. Although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements  they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord. So our idea is to create a bypass  is to use these brain machine interfaces to read these signals  larger scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again  bypass the lesion using computational microengineering and send it to a new body  a whole body called an exoskeleton  a whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients. And you can see an image produced by this consortium. This is a nonprofit consortium called the Walk Again Project that is putting together scientists from Europe  from here in the United States  and in Brazil together to work to actually get this new body built    a body that we believe  through the same plastic mechanisms that allow Aurora and other monkeys to use these tools through a brain machine interface and that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life. This same mechanism  we hope  will allow these patients  not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body  but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls. So I was told about    years ago that this would never happen  that this was close to impossible. And I can only tell you that as a scientist  I grew up in southern Brazil in the mid '  s watching a few crazy guys telling  us  that they would go to the Moon. And I was five years old  and I never understood why NASA didn't hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job  after all  they were very proficient    but just seeing that as a kid made me believe  as my grandmother used to tell me  that  impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true.  So they told me that it's impossible to make someone walk. I think I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice. Thank you. The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics  dating back to at least before Adam Smith. And that is  why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior  Now  many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question  and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this. What I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save. Let me tell you a little bit about savings rates  a little bit about language  and then I'll draw that connection. Let's start by thinking about the member countries of the OECD  or the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. OECD countries  by and large  you should think about these as the richest  most industrialized countries in the world. And by joining the OECD  they were affirming a common commitment to democracy  open markets and free trade. Despite all of these similarities  we see huge differences in savings behavior. So all the way over on the left of this graph  what you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year  and some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year. Holding down the right flank of the OECD  all the way on the other side  is Greece. And what you can see is that over the last    years  Greece has barely managed to save more than    percent of their GDP. It should be noted  of course  that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line. Now that we see these huge differences in savings rates  how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences  Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ. Linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now. And then I'll draw the connection between these two behaviors. Many of you have probably already noticed that I'm Chinese. I grew up in the Midwest of the United States. And something I realized quite early on was that the Chinese language forced me to speak about and    in fact  more fundamentally than that    ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways. Now  how might that be  Let me give you an example. Suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle. You understood exactly what I just said in English. If we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other  though  I wouldn't have that luxury. I wouldn't have been able to convey so little information. What my language would have forced me to do  instead of just telling you   This is my uncle   is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information. My language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side  whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth  and if this man was my father's brother  whether he was older than or younger than my father. All of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it. And in fact  if I want to speak correctly  Chinese forces me to constantly think about it. Now  that fascinated me endlessly as a child  but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time. So for example  if I'm speaking in English  I have to speak grammatically differently if I'm talking about past rain   It rained yesterday   current rain   It is raining now   or future rain   It will rain tomorrow.  Notice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events. Why  Because I have to consider that and I have to modify what I'm saying to say   It will rain   or  It's going to rain.  It's simply not permissible in English to say   It rain tomorrow.  In contrast to that  that's almost exactly what you would say in Chinese. A Chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an English speaker's ears. They can say   Yesterday it rain    Now it rain    Tomorrow it rain.  In some deep sense  Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly. Is this difference in languages only between very  very distantly related languages  like English and Chinese  Actually  no. So many of you know  in this room  that English is a Germanic language. What you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier. It is the only Germanic language that requires this. For example  most other Germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying   Morgen regnet es   quite literally to an English ear   It rain tomorrow.  This led me  as a behavioral economist  to an intriguing hypothesis. Could how you speak about time  could how your language forces you to think about time  affect your propensity to behave across time  You speak English  a futured language. And what that means is that every time you discuss the future  or any kind of a future event  grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it's something viscerally different. Now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak. If that's true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present  that's going to make it harder to save. If  on the other hand  you speak a futureless language  the present and the future  you speak about them identically. If that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically  that's going to make it easier to save. Now this is a fanciful theory. I'm a professor  I get paid to have fanciful theories. But how would you actually go about testing such a theory  Well  what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature. And interestingly enough  there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world. This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe. Interestingly enough  when you start to crank the data  these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be  by and large  some of the world's best savers. Just to give you a hint of that  let's look back at that OECD graph that we were talking about. What you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages. What is the average difference here  Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year. Over    years that has huge long run effects on the wealth of your nation. Now while these findings are suggestive  countries can be different in so many different ways that it's very  very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences. What I'm going to show you  though  is something that I've been engaging in for a year  which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets that we have access to as economists  and I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences  hoping to get this relationship to break. And just in summary  no matter how far I push this  I can't get it to break. Let me show you how far you can do that. One way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world. So for example  there is the Survey of Health   Aging  and Retirement in Europe. From this dataset you actually learn that retired European families are extremely patient with survey takers. So imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door.  Excuse me  would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio  Do you happen to know how much your house is worth  Do you mind telling me  Would you happen to have a hallway that's more than    meters long  If you do  would you mind if I timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway  Would you mind squeezing as hard as you can  in your dominant hand  this device so I can measure your grip strength  How about blowing into this tube so I can measure your lung capacity   The survey takes over a day. Combine that with a Demographic and Health Survey collected by USAID in developing countries in Africa  for example  which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the HIV status of families living in  for example  rural Nigeria. Combine that with a world value survey  which measures the political opinions and  fortunately for me  the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world. Take all of that data  combine it  and this map is what you get. What you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both futureless and futured languages. And what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure  and then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels. What are the characteristics we can control for  Well I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence  the demographics    what sex  their age    their income level within their own country  their educational achievement  a lot about their family structure. It turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe. And most granularly  I break them down by religion where there are    categories of religions in the world    so an extreme level of granularity. There are  .  billion different ways that a family can find itself. Now effectively everything I'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families. It's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in Brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions  but one of whom speaks Flemish and one of whom speaks French  or two families that live in a rural district in Nigeria  one of whom speaks Hausa and one of whom speaks Igbo. Now even after all of this granular level of control  do futureless language speakers seem to save more  Yes  futureless language speakers  even after this level of control  are    percent more likely to report having saved in any given year. Does this have cumulative effects  Yes  by the time they retire  futureless language speakers  holding constant their income  are going to retire with    percent more in savings. Can we push this data even further  Yes  because I just told you  we actually collect a lot of health data as economists. Now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings  Well  think about smoking  for example. Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings. If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure  smoking is just the opposite. It's current pleasure in exchange for future pain. What we should expect then is the opposite effect. And that's exactly what we find. Futureless language speakers are    to    percent less likely to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families  and they're going to be    to    percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire  and they're going to report being    percent more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter. I could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find. It's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect isn't present. My linguistics and economics colleagues at Yale and I are just starting to do this work and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak. Ultimately  the goal  once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making  we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future. Thank you very much. Okay  this morning I'm speaking on the question of corruption. And corruption is defined as the abuse of a position of trust for the benefit of yourself    or  in the case of our context  your friends  your family or your financiers. Okay  Friends  family and financiers. But we need to understand what we understand about corruption  and we need to understand that we have been miseducated about it  and we have to admit that. We have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it. The first thing is that the big myth  number one  is that in fact it's not really a crime. When we get together with friends and family and we discuss crime in our country  crime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella  nobody's speaking about corruption. That's the honest truth. When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime  he isn't speaking about corruption. And we know for sure when the Minister of National Security is speaking about crime  he's not talking about corruption either. The point I'm making is that it is a crime. It is an economic crime  because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money. Public and private corruption is a reality. As somebody who comes from the private sector  I can tell you there's a massive amount of corruption in the private sector that has nothing to do with government. The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table  it all takes place in the private sector. Today  I'm focusing on public sector corruption  which the private sector also participates in. The second important myth to understand    because we have to destroy these myths  dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them    the second important myth to understand is the one that says that in fact corruption is only a small problem    if it is a problem  it's only a small problem  that in fact it's only a little    or    percent  it's been going on forever  it probably will continue forever  and there's no point passing any laws  because there's little we can do about it. And I want to demonstrate that that  too  is a dangerous myth  very dangerous. It's a piece of public mischief. And I want to speak a little bit  take us back about    years. We're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago  a resource rich  small Caribbean country  and in the early     s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth  and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices. We call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money. And it's ironic  because we're standing today in the Central Bank. You see  history's rich in irony. We're standing today in the Central Bank  and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about. Okay  We're talking about irresponsibility in public office. We're speaking about the fact that across the terrace  the next tower is the Ministry of Finance  and there's a lot of connection with us today  so we're speaking within your temple today. Okay  The first thing I want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about    years ago  we embarked  the government of the day embarked on a series of government to government arrangements to have rapidly develop the country. And some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government to government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world  the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on. As I said  even this building we're standing in    that's one of the ironies    this building was part of that series of complexes  what they called the Twin Towers. It became so outrageous  the whole situation  that in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed  and it reported in          years ago it reported    the Ballah Report       years ago  and immediately the government to government arrangements were stopped. The then Prime Minister went to Parliament to give a budget speech  and he said some things that I'll never forget. They went right in here. I was a young man at the time. It went right into my heart. And he said that  in fact   Let me see if this thing works. Are we getting a  yeah   That's what he told us. He told us that  in fact  two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars that we spent  the taxpayers' money  was wasted or stolen. So the    or    percent is pure mischief. As we say  it's a nancy story. Forget it. That's for little children. We are big people  and we're trying to deal with what's happening in our society. Okay  This is the size of the problem. Okay  Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted. That was    years ago.      was Ballah. So what has changed  I don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience  but I have to. Four months ago  we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country. We call it the Section    fiasco  the Section    fiasco  a suspicious piece of law  and I'm going to say it like it is  a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects.  Laughter  And it was called  those people are called the Piarco Airport accused. I'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today. They are the Piarco Airport accused. It was a constitutional outrage of the first order  and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament. Our highest institution in our country was perverted. We are dealing with perverts here of an economic and financial nature. Do you get how serious this problem is  There was massive protest. A lot of us in this room took part in the protest in different forms. Most importantly  the American embassy complained  so Parliament was swiftly reconvened  and the law was reversed  it was repealed. That's the word lawyers use. It was repealed. But the point is that Parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events  because what really happened is that  because of the suspicious passage of that law  the law was actually passed into effect on the weekend we celebrated our   th anniversary of independence  our jubilee of independence. So that is the kind of outrage of the thing. It was kind of a nasty way to get maturation  but we got it  because we all understood it  and for the first time that I could remember  there were mass protests against this corruption. And that gave me a lot of hope. Okay  Those of us who are  sometimes you feel like you're a little bit on your own doing some of this work. That passage of the law and the repeal of the law fortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused. So it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place. But what were they accused of  What was it that they were accused of  I'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there. What were they accused of  We were trying to build  or reconstruct largely  an airport that had grown outdated. The entire project cost about  .  billion dollars  Trinidad and Tobago dollars  and in fact  we had a lot of bid rigging and suspicious activity  corrupt activity took place. And to get an idea of what it consisted of  and to put it in context in relationship to this whole second myth about it being no big thing  we can look at this second slide here. And what we have here    I am not saying so  this is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement. He said so. And he's telling us that for the   .  billion cost of the project  one billion dollars has been traced to offshore bank accounts. One billion dollars of our taxpayers' money has been located in offshore bank accounts. Being the kind of suspicious person I am  I am outraged at that  and I'm going to pause here  I'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things. I'm going to pause here and bring in something I saw in November last year at Wall Street. I was at Zuccotti Park. It was autumn. It was cool. It was damp. It was getting dark. And I was walking around with the protesters looking at the One Wall Street  Occupy Wall Street movement walking around. And there was a lady with a sign  a very simple sign  a kind of battered looking blonde lady  and the sign was made out of Bristol board  as we say in these parts  and it was made with a marker. And what it said on that sign hit me right in the center. It said   If you're not outraged  you haven't been paying attention.  If you're not outraged by all of this  you haven't been paying attention. So listen up  because we're getting into even deeper waters. My brain started thinking. Well  what if    because I'm suspicious like that. I read a lot of spy novels and stuff. What if     Laughter  But to make it in these wrongs  you have to read a lot of spy novels and follow some of that stuff  right   Laughter  But what if this wasn't the first time  What if this is just the first time that the so and sos had been caught  What if it had happened before  How would I find out  Now  the previous two examples I gave were to do with construction sector corruption  okay  And I have the privilege at this time to lead the Joint Consultative Council  which is a not for profit. We're at jcc.org.tt  and we have the    we are the leaders in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system about how public money is transacted. So those of you interested in finding out more about it  or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions  please get involved. But I'm going to segue to another thing that relates  because one of my private campaigns I've been conducting for over three and a half years is for transparency and accountability around the bailout of CL Financial. CL Financial is the Caribbean's largest ever conglomerate  okay  And without getting into all of the details  it is said to have collapsed   I'm using my words very carefully   it's said to have collapsed in January of '    which is just coming up to nearly four years. In an unprecedented fit of generosity    and you have to be very suspicious about these people    in an unprecedented   and I'm using that word carefully   unprecedented fit of generosity  the government of the day signed  made a written commitment  to repay all of the creditors. And I can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn't happened anywhere else on the planet. Let's understand  because we lack context. People are telling us it's just like Wall Street. It's not just like Wall Street. Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something. It's not just like anywhere.  Applause  It's not just like anywhere. It's not just like anywhere. Here is here  and out there is out there. Okay  I'm serious now. Listen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street. They've had bailouts in London. They've had bailouts in Europe. In Africa  they've had bailouts. In Nigeria  six of the major commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours  eh  It's interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has    how they've treated it  and they've treated it very well compared to us. Nowhere on the planet have all the creditors been bailed out in excess of what their statutory entitlements were. Only here. So what was the reason for the generosity  Is our government that generous  And maybe they are. Let's look at it. Let's look into it. So I started digging and writing and so and so on  and that work can be found  my personal work can be found at AfraRaymond.com  which is my name. It's a not for profit blog that I run. Not as popular as some of the other people  but there you go. But the point is that the bitter experience of Section     that plot to pervert Parliament  that bitter experience that took place in August  when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence  going into September  forced me to check myself and recalculate my bearings  and to go back into some of the work  some of the stuff I'd written and some of the exchanges I'd had with the officials to see what was really what. As we say in Trinidad and Tobago  who is who and what is what  Okay  We want to try to recalculate. And I made a Freedom of Information application in May this year to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over. This is the other context. The Ministry of Finance  we are told  is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. I'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that's really so. The Central Bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. So in fact  you can't ask them anything  and they don't have to answer anything. That is the law since     . So I plunged into this struggle  and I asked four questions. And I'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply  so you could understand  as I said  where we are. Here is not like anywhere else. Question number one  I asked to see the accounts of CL Financial  and if you can't show me the accounts    the Minister of Finance is making statements  passing new laws and giving speeches and so on. What are the figures he's relying on  It's like that joke  I want whatever he's drinking. And they wrote back and said to me  well what do you really mean  So they hit my question with a question. Second point  I want to see who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid  Let me pause here to point out to you all that    billion dollars of our money has been spent on this. That is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars coming out of a small    we used to be resource rich    Caribbean country. Okay  And I asked the question  who was getting that three and a half billion dollars  And I want to pause again to bring up context  because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing. There's a particular individual who is in the government now. The name of the person doesn't matter. And that person made a career out of using the Freedom of Information Act to advance his political cause. Okay  His name isn't important. I wouldn't dignify it. I'm on a point. The point is  that person made a career out of using the Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause. And the most famous case was what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal  where in fact there was about    million dollars in government money that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships  and the scholarships hadn't been advertised  and so and so on and so on. And he was able to get the court  using that act of Parliament  Freedom of Information Act  to release the information  and I thought that was excellent. Fantastic. But you see  the question is this  If it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act and to use the court to force a disclosure about    million dollars in public money  it must be right and proper for us to force a disclosure about    billion dollars. You see  But the Ministry of Finance  the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance  wrote me and said to me  that information is exempt too. You see  This is what we're dealing with  okay  The third thing I will tell you is that I also asked for the directors of CL Financial  whether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act. We have an Integrity in Public Life Act as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation's interest. And public officials are supposed to file to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities. And of course I've since discovered that they're not filing  and in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file. So here we have it. We have a situation where the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded. I've asked the question in the legal and required fashion. It's been ignored. The sort of thing that motivated us around Section     we need to continue to work on that. We can't forget it. I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history. It's also the single largest example of public corruption according to this equation. And this is my reality check. Where you have an expenditure of public money and it is without accountability and it's without transparency  it will always be equal to corruption  whether you're in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska  it will always be equal to corruption  and that is what we are dealing with here. I'm going to continue the work to press on  to get some resolution of those matters at the Ministry of Finance. If it is I have to go to court personally  I will do that. We will continue to press on. We will continue to work within JCC. But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context and bring something new to the table in terms of an international example. We had the journalist  Heather  Brooke speaking about her battle against government corruption  and she introduced me to this website  Alaveteli.com. And Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database for Freedom of Information applications  and speak with each other. I could see what you're applying for. You could see what I applied for and what replies I got. We can work on it together. We need to build a collective database and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point. We need to increase the consciousness. The final thing I want to say is in relation to this one  which is a lovely website from India called IPaidABribe.com. They have international branches  and it's important for us to tune into this one. IPaidABribe.com is really important  a good one to log on to and see. I'm going to pause there. I'm going to ask you for your courage. Discard the first myth  it is a crime. Discard the second myth  it is a big thing. It's a huge problem. It's an economic crime. And let us continue working together to betterment in this situation  stability and sustainability in our society. Thank you. Radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education. We have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity. But I want to tell you the story of PISA  OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills of    year olds around the world  and it's really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy. Look at how the world looked in the     s  in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school. You can see the United States ahead of everyone else  and much of the economic success of the United States draws on its long standing advantage as the first mover in education. But in the     s  some countries caught up. In the     s  the global expansion of the talent pool continued. And the world didn't stop in the     s. So in the '  s  the U.S. was first. In the '  s  it was   th  and not because standards had fallen  but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere. Korea shows you what's possible in education. Two generations ago  Korea had the standard of living of Afghanistan today  and was one of the lowest education performers. Today  every young Korean finishes high school. So this tells us that  in a global economy  it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success  but the best performing education systems internationally. The trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do. Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets  while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need. And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives. So with PISA  we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly. And we took a very special angle to this. We were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school  but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations. Now  some people have criticized us for this. They say  you know  such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people  because we test students with problems they haven't seen before. But if you take that logic  you know  you should consider life unfair  because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school  but whether we are prepared for change  whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created  to use technologies that haven't been invented  to solve problems we just can't anticipate today. And once hotly contested  our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard. In our latest assessment in       we measured    school systems that together cover    percent of the economy. This chart shows you the performance of countries. In red  sort of below OECD average. Yellow is so so  and in green are the countries doing really well. You can see Shanghai  Korea  Singapore in Asia  Finland in Europe  Canada in North America doing really well. You can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between    year olds in Shanghai and    year olds in Chile  and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance. There's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today's economy. But I want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture. Educators like to talk about equity. With PISA  we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity  in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances. And we see that in some countries  the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very  very strong. Opportunities are unequally distributed. A lot of potential of young children is wasted. We see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you're born. We all want to be there  in the upper right quadrant  where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed. Nobody  and no country  can afford to be there  where performance is poor and there are large social disparities. And then we can debate  you know  is it better to be there  where performance is strong at the price of large disparities  Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity  But actually  if you look at how countries come out on this picture  you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity. In fact  one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence. These countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all  a very important lesson. And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people. And ever since those results came out  policymakers  educators  researchers from around the world have tried to figure out what's behind the success of those systems. But let's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started PISA  and I'm giving them a colored bubble now. And I'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students. If money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes  you would find all the large bubbles at the top  no  But that's not what you see. Spending per student only explains about  well  less than    percent of the performance variation among countries  and Luxembourg  for example  the most expensive system  doesn't do particularly well. What you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results. You also see    and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings    that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well educated countries  and poor and badly educated ones  a very  very important lesson. Let's look at this in greater detail. The red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country's wealth. One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well  and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession. And Korea also invests into long school days  which drives up costs further. Last but not least  Koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop. They invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things. All that costs money. How can Korea afford all of this  The answer is  students in Korea learn in large classes. This is the blue bar which is driving costs down. You go to the next country on the list  Luxembourg  and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea  so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does. But  you know  parents and teachers and policymakers in Luxembourg all like small classes. You know  it's very pleasant to walk into a small class. So they have invested all their money into there  and the blue bar  class size  is driving costs up. But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once  and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well. Students don't have long hours of learning. And basically  teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching. So you can see two countries spent their money very differently  and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education. Let's go back to the year     . Remember  that was the year before the iPod was invented. This is how the world looked then in terms of PISA performance. The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller  no  We spent a lot less on education  about    percent less on education. So you ask yourself  if education has become so much more expensive  has it become so much better  And the bitter truth really is that  you know  not in many countries. But there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements. Germany  my own country  in the year       featured in the lower quadrant  below average performance  large social disparities. And remember  Germany  we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees. Very disappointing results. People were stunned by the results. And for the very first time  the public debate in Germany was dominated for months by education  not tax  not other kinds of issues  but education was the center of the public debate. And then policymakers began to respond to this. The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education. A lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage. And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies  but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education. For example  traditionally  the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families  and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten. PISA has transformed that debate  and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany. Or traditionally  the German education divides children at the age of     very young children  between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers  and that mainly along socioeconomic lines  and that paradigm is being challenged now too. A lot of change. And the good news is  nine years later  you can see improvements in quality and equity. People have taken up the challenge  done something about it. Or take Korea  at the other end of the spectrum. In the year       Korea did already very well  but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence. They took up the challenge  and Korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading. Well  if you only focus on your brightest students  you know what happens is disparities grow  and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction  but still  an impressive improvement. A major overhaul of Poland's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools  turn around many of the lowest performing schools  and raise performance by over half a school year. And you can see other countries as well. Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system  raise quality and improve equity  and so did Hungary. So what you can actually see  there's been a lot of change. And even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture  of economic factors  of social issues  of homogeneity of societies  and so on  these people must now concede that education improvement is possible. You know  Poland hasn't changed its culture. It didn't change its economy. It didn't change the compositions of its population. It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies and practice. Very impressive. And all that raises  of course  the question  What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity  high levels of performance  and raised outcomes  And  of course  the question is  can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere  Of course  you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale  but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high performing systems share. Everybody agrees that education is important. Everybody says that. But the test of truth is  how do you weigh that priority against other priorities  How do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers  Would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer  How do the media talk about schools and teachers  Those are the critical questions  and what we have learned from PISA is that  in high performing education systems  the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education  their future  more than consumption today. And you know what's interesting  You won't believe it  but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school. Those things really exist. But placing a high value on education is just part of the picture. The other part is the belief that all children are capable of success. You have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages. You know  students are divided up  reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world class standards. But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities. If you go to Japan in Asia  or Finland in Europe  parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed  and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior. When we asked students what counts for success in mathematics  students in North America would typically tell us  you know  it's all about talent. If I'm not born as a genius in math  I'd better study something else. Nine out of    Japanese students say that it depends on my own investment  on my own effort  and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them. In the past  different students were taught in similar ways. High performers on PISA embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices. They realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents  and they personalize learning opportunities. High performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum. Every student knows what matters. Every student knows what's required to be successful. And nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers. High performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them. They watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling  and how they structure teacher pay. They provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice. And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers. In bureaucratic school systems  teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching. High performing systems are very clear what good performance is. They set very ambitious standards  but then they enable their teachers to figure out  what do I need to teach to my students today  The past was about delivered wisdom in education. Now the challenge is to enable user generated wisdom. High performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control    sort of  how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education    to professional forms of work organization. They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy. They provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices. The goal of the past was standardization and compliance. High performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive. In the past  the policy focus was on outcomes  on provision. The high performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher  the next school around their lives. And the most impressive outcomes of world class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system. You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA  but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools. Every school succeeds. This is where success is systemic. And how do they do that  They invest resources where they can make the most difference. They attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools  and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom. Last but not least  those countries align policies across all areas of public policy. They make them coherent over sustained periods of time  and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented. Now  knowing what successful systems are doing doesn't yet tell us how to improve. That's also clear  and that's where some of the limits of international comparisons of PISA are. That's where other forms of research need to kick in  and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into telling countries what they should be doing. But its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing. And the example of PISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems. You know  some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards. You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this.  Laughter  But PISA has shown what's possible in education. It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible. It has taken away excuses from those who are complacent. And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders. If we can help every child  every teacher  every school  every principal  every parent see what improvement is possible  that only the sky is the limit to education improvement  we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives. Thank you. I grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek. Star Trek made me want to see alien creatures  creatures from a far distant world. But basically  I figured out that I could find those alien creatures right on Earth. And what I do is I study insects. I'm obsessed with insects  particularly insect flight. I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps one of the most important events in the history of life. Without insects  there'd be no flowering plants. Without flowering plants  there would be no clever  fruit eating primates giving TED Talks. Now  David and Hidehiko and Ketaki gave a very compelling story about the similarities between fruit flies and humans  and there are many similarities  and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies  the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this  for example    but in my talk  I don't want to emphasize on the similarities between humans and fruit flies  but rather the differences  and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing. And so I want to show you a high speed video sequence of a fly shot at       frames per second in infrared lighting  and to the right  off screen  is an electronic looming predator that is going to go at the fly. The fly is going to sense this predator. It is going to extend its legs out. It's going to sashay away to live to fly another day. Now I have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink  so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye  the fly has seen this looming predator  estimated its position  initiated a motor pattern to fly it away  beating its wings at     times a second as it does so. I think this is a fascinating behavior that shows how fast the fly's brain can process information. Now  flight    what does it take to fly  Well  in order to fly  just as in a human aircraft  you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces  you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight  and you need a controller  and in the first human aircraft  the controller was basically the brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit. Now  how does this compare to a fly  Well  I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air. And you might have heard how engineers proved that bumblebees couldn't fly. Well  the problem was in thinking that the insect wings function in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't. And we tackle this problem by building giant  dynamically scaled model robot insects that would flap in giant pools of mineral oil where we could study the aerodynamic forces. And it turns out that the insects flap their wings in a very clever way  at a very high angle of attack that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing  a little tornado like structure called a leading edge vortex  and it's that vortex that actually enables the wings to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air. But the thing that's actually most    so  what's fascinating is not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology. What's clever is the way the fly flaps it  which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system  and this is what enables flies to perform these remarkable aerial maneuvers. Now  what about the engine  The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating. They have two types of flight muscle  so called power muscle  which is stretch activated  which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contraction by contraction basis by the nervous system. It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight  and it fills the middle portion of the fly  so when a fly hits your windshield  it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at. But attached to the base of the wing is a set of little  tiny control muscles that are not very powerful at all  but they're very fast  and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing on a stroke by stroke basis  and this is what enables the fly to change its wing and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces which change its flight trajectory. And of course  the role of the nervous system is to control all this. So let's look at the controller. Now flies excel in the sorts of sensors that they carry to this problem. They have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection. They have a sophisticated eye which is the fastest visual system on the planet. They have another set of eyes on the top of their head. We have no idea what they do. They have sensors on their wing. Their wing is covered with sensors  including sensors that sense deformation of the wing. They can even taste with their wings. One of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has is a structure called the halteres. The halteres are actually gyroscopes. These devices beat back and forth about     hertz during flight  and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation and initiate very  very fast corrective maneuvers. But all of this sensory information has to be processed by a brain  and yes  indeed  flies have a brain  a brain of about         neurons. Now several people at this conference have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience because they're a simple model of brain function. And the basic punchline of my talk is  I'd like to turn that over on its head. I don't think they're a simple model of anything. And I think that flies are a great model. They're a great model for flies. And let's explore this notion of simplicity. So I think  unfortunately  a lot of neuroscientists  we're all somewhat narcissistic. When we think of brain  we of course imagine our own brain. But remember that this kind of brain  which is much  much smaller   instead of     billion neurons  it has         neurons   but this is the most common form of brain on the planet and has been for     million years. And is it fair to say that it's simple  Well  it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons  but is that a fair metric  And I would propose it's not a fair metric. So let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare    we have to compare the size of the brain with what the brain can do. So I propose we have a Trump number  and the Trump number is the ratio of this man's behavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain. We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly. Now  how many people here think the Trump number is higher for the fruit fly  It's a very smart  smart audience. Yes  the inequality goes in this direction  or I would posit it. Now I realize that it is a little bit absurd to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly. But let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse. A mouse has about       times as many neurons as a fly. I used to study mice. When I studied mice  I used to talk really slowly. And then something happened when I started to work on flies. And I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice  it's really comparable. They have to forage for food. They have to engage in courtship. They have sex. They hide from predators. They do a lot of the similar things. But I would argue that flies do more. So for example  I'm going to show you a sequence  and I have to say  some of my funding comes from the military  so I'm showing this classified sequence and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay  So I want you to look at the payload at the tail of the fruit fly. Watch it very closely  and you'll see why my six year old son now wants to be a neuroscientist. Wait for it. Pshhew. So at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice  they're at least as clever as pigeons.  Laughter  Now  I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons. So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab  and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk. But up in the corner  in the right corner  you'll see  at the same scale  a visual interneuron from a fly. And I'll expand this up. And it's a beautifully complex neuron. It's just very  very tiny  and there's lots of biophysical challenges with trying to compute information with tiny  tiny neurons. How small can neurons get  Well  look at this interesting insect. It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings  it has eyes  it has antennae  its legs  complicated life history  it's a parasite  it has to fly around and find caterpillars to parasatize  but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain  which is comparable for a fruit fly  it is the size of a salt grain. So here's some other organisms at the similar scale. This animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba  and it has a brain of       neurons that's so small    you know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about  where the nucleus of the neuron is  This animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space. So this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience. I would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works. But let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot  And I think  from an engineering perspective  you think of multiplexing. You can take a hardware and have that hardware do different things at different times  or have different parts of the hardware doing different things. And these are the two concepts I'd like to explore. And they're not concepts that I've come up with  but concepts that have been proposed by others in the past. And one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs. And I don't mean chewing the crabs. I grew up in Baltimore  and I chew crabs very  very well. But I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing. Crab chewing is actually really fascinating. Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace called the gastric mill that grinds their food in a variety of different ways. And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure. The amazing thing about this is that it's controlled by a really tiny set of neurons  about two dozen neurons that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns  and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion in the crab is actually inundated by many  many neuromodulators. You heard about neuromodulators earlier. There are more neuromodulators that alter  that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure  and they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns. And this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues who've been studying this fascinating system that show how a smaller cluster of neurons can do many  many  many things because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment by moment basis. So this is basically multiplexing in time. Imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator. You select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior  another neuromodulator  another set of cells  a different pattern  and you can imagine you could extrapolate to a very  very complicated system. Is there any evidence that flies do this  Well  for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world  we've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators. You can tether a fly to a little stick. You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating. You can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display. So let me show you a little tiny sequence of this. Here's a fly and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator  and this is a game the flies love to play. You allow them to steer towards the little stripe  and they'll just steer towards that stripe forever. It's part of their visual guidance system. But very  very recently  it's been possible to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies. So this is the preparation that one of my former post docs  Gaby Maimon  who's now at Rockefeller  developed  and it's basically a flight simulator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode in the brain of the fly and record from a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain. And this is what one of these experiments looks like. It was a sequence taken from another post doc in the lab  Bettina Schnell. The green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential of a neuron in the fly's brain  and you'll see the fly start to fly  and the fly is actually controlling the rotation of that visual pattern itself by its own wing motion  and you can see this visual interneuron respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies. So for the first time we've actually been able to record from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight. And one of the lessons we've been learning is that the physiology of cells that we've been studying for many years in quiescent flies is not the same as the physiology of those cells when the flies actually engage in active behaviors like flying and walking and so forth. And why is the physiology different  Well it turns out it's these neuromodulators  just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs. So here's a picture of the octopamine system. Octopamine is a neuromodulator that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors. But this is just one of many neuromodulators that's in the fly's brain. So I really think that  as we learn more  it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion  and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons. Now  another idea  another way of multiplexing is multiplexing in space  having different parts of a neuron do different things at the same time. So here's two sort of canonical neurons from a vertebrate and an invertebrate  a human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal  and another cell to the right  a non spiking interneuron  and this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago  and Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea based on the fact that this neuron from a locust does not fire action potentials. It's a non spiking cell. So a typical cell  like the neurons in our brain  has a region called the dendrites that receives input  and that input sums together and will produce action potentials that run down the axon and then activate all the output regions of the neuron. But non spiking neurons are actually quite complicated because they can have input synapses and output synapses all interdigitated  and there's no single action potential that drives all the outputs at the same time. So there's a possibility that you have computational compartments that allow the different parts of the neuron to do different things at the same time. So these basic concepts of multitasking in time and multitasking in space  I think these are things that are true in our brains as well  but I think the insects are the true masters of this. So I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time  and as I say up here  please think before you swat. So here's the good news about families. The last    years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family. We have blended families  adopted families  we have nuclear families living in separate houses and divorced families living in the same house. But through it all  the family has grown stronger. Eight in    say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in. Now  here's the bad news. Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed by the chaos of family life. Every parent I know  myself included  feels like we're constantly playing defense. Just when our kids stop teething  they start having tantrums. Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath  they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying. And here's the worst news of all. Our children sense we're out of control. Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute asked       children   If you were granted one wish about your parents  what would it be   The parents predicted the kids would say  spending more time with them. They were wrong. The kids' number one wish  That their parents be less tired and less stressed. So how can we change this dynamic  Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress  draw our family closer  and generally prepare our children to enter the world  I spent the last few years trying to answer that question  traveling around  meeting families  talking to scholars  experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets. I was trying to figure out  what do happy families do right and what can I learn from them to make my family happier  I want to tell you about one family that I met  and why I think they offer clues. At   p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs  Idaho  where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week  the family meeting. The Starrs are a regular American family with their share of regular American family problems. David is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care of their four children  ages    to   . One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town. One has lacrosse on the near side of town. One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.  We were living in complete chaos   Eleanor said. What the Starrs did next  though  was surprising. Instead of turning to friends or relatives  they looked to David's workplace. They turned to a cutting edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan to startups in Silicon Valley. In agile  workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time. So instead of having executives issue grand proclamations  the team in effect manages itself. You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions. You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing. David said when they brought this system into their home  the family meetings in particular increased communication  decreased stress  and made everybody happier to be part of the family team. When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then five year old twin daughters  it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born. And these meetings had this effect while taking under    minutes. So what is Agile  and why can it help with something that seems so different  like families  In       Jeff Sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in New England. He was very frustrated with how software got designed. Companies followed the waterfall method  right  in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below  and no one had ever consulted the programmers. Eighty three percent of projects failed. They were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done. Sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time. He read    years of Harvard Business Review before stumbling upon an article in      called  The New New Product Development Game.  It said that the pace of business was quickening    and by the way  this was in         and the most successful companies were flexible. It highlighted Toyota and Canon and likened their adaptable  tight knit teams to rugby scrums. As Sutherland told me  we got to that article  and said   That's it.  In Sutherland's system  companies don't use large  massive projects that take two years. They do things in small chunks. Nothing takes longer than two weeks. So instead of saying   You guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network   you say   You go off and come up with one element  then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt.  You succeed or fail quickly. Today  agile is used in a hundred countries  and it's sweeping into management suites. Inevitably  people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families. You had blogs pop up  and some manuals were written. Even the Sutherlands told me that they had an Agile Thanksgiving  where you had one group of people working on the food  one setting the table  and one greeting visitors at the door. Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever. So let's take one problem that families face  crazy mornings  and talk about how agile can help. A key plank is accountability  so teams use information radiators  these large boards in which everybody is accountable. So the Starrs  in adapting this to their home  created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores. So on the morning I visited  Eleanor came downstairs  poured herself a cup of coffee  sat in a reclining chair  and she sat there  kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs  checked the list  made themselves breakfast  checked the list again  put the dishes in the dishwasher  rechecked the list  fed the pets or whatever chores they had  checked the list once more  gathered their belongings  and made their way to the bus. It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen. And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house  our kids needed way too much monitoring  Eleanor looked at me.  That's what I thought   she said.  I told David  'keep your work out of my kitchen.' But I was wrong.  So I turned to David   So why does it work   He said   You can't underestimate the power of doing this.  And he made a checkmark. He said   In the workplace  adults love it. With kids  it's heaven.  The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house  it cut parental screaming in half.  Laughter  But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings. So following the agile model  we ask three questions  What worked well in our family this week  what didn't work well  and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead  Everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on. And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths. What worked well this week  Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds. What didn't work well  Our math sheets  or greeting visitors at the door. Like a lot of parents  our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles. Like  thoughts and ideas go in  but none ever comes out  I mean at least not that are revealing. This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts. But the most surprising part was when we turned to  what are we going to work on in the week ahead  You know  the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves  and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids. Our kids love this process. So they would come up with all these ideas. You know  greet five visitors at the door this week  get an extra    minutes of reading before bed. Kick someone  lose desserts for a month. It turns out  by the way  our girls are little Stalins. We constantly have to kind of dial them back. Now look  naturally there's a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week  but the truth is it didn't really bother us. It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come. Three years later    our girls are almost eight now    We're still holding these meetings. My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom. So what did we learn  The word  agile  entered the lexicon in      when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers met in Utah and wrote a    point Agile Manifesto. I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto. I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met. I'm proposing three planks. Plank number one  Adapt all the time. When I became a parent  I figured  you know what  We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them. That assumes  as parents  we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise. We can't. What's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time. It's like they say in the Internet world  if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago  you're doing the wrong thing. Parents can learn a lot from that. But to me   adapt all the time  means something deeper  too. We have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self help gurus or other family experts. The truth is  their ideas are stale  whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively. Let's just take a few examples. Let's take the biggest issue of all  family dinner. Everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids. But for so many of us  it doesn't work in our lives. I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said   No problem  I'll just time shift family dinner. I'm not home  can't make family dinner  We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack. We'll make Sunday meals more important.  And the truth is  recent research backs him up. It turns out there's only    minutes of productive time in any family meal. The rest of it's taken up with  take your elbows off the table  and  pass the ketchup.  You can take that    minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit. So time shift family dinner. That's adaptability. An environmental psychologist told me   If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface  you'll be more rigid. If you're sitting on a cushioned chair  you'll be more open.  She told me   When you're discipling your children  sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface. The conversation will go better.  My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because I was sitting above in the power position. So move where you sit. That's adaptability. The point is there are all these new ideas out there. We've got to hook them up with parents. So plank number one  Adapt all the time. Be flexible  be open minded  let the best ideas win. Plank number two  Empower your children. Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around. It's easier  and frankly  we're usually right. There's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family. But the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible. Enlist the children in their own upbringing. Just yesterday  we were having our family meeting  and we had voted to work on overreacting. So we said   Okay  give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay   So one of my daughters threw out  you get five minutes of overreacting time all week. So we kind of liked that. But then her sister started working the system. She said   Do I get one five minute overreaction or can I get       second overreactions   I loved that. Spend the time however you want. Now give us a punishment. Okay. If we get    minutes of overreaction time  that's the limit. Every minute above that  we have to do one pushup. So you see  this is working. Now look  this system isn't lax. There's plenty of parental authority going on. But we're giving them practice becoming independent  which of course is our ultimate goal. Just as I was leaving to come here tonight  one of my daughters started screaming. The other one said   Overreaction  Overreaction   and started counting  and within    seconds it had ended. To me that is a certified agile miracle. And by the way  research backs this up too. Children who plan their own goals  set weekly schedules  evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives. The point is  we have to let our children succeed on their own terms  and yes  on occasion  fail on their own terms. I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker  and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance. And I said   But what if they drive into a ditch   He said   It's much better to drive into a ditch with a    allowance than a         a year salary or a    million inheritance.  So the bottom line is  empower your children. Plank number three  Tell your story. Adaptability is fine  but we also need bedrock. Jim Collins  the author of  Good To Great   told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common  they preserve the core  they stimulate progress. So agile is great for stimulating progress  but I kept hearing time and again  you need to preserve the core. So how do you do that  Collins coached us on doing something that businesses do  which is define your mission and identify your core values. So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement. We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat. We had a pajama party. I made popcorn. Actually  I burned one  so I made two. My wife bought a flip chart. And we had this great conversation  like  what's important to us  What values do we most uphold  And we ended up with    statements. We are travelers  not tourists. We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions. Again  research shows that parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong and more time focusing on what they do right  worry less about the bad times and build up the good times. This family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right. A few weeks later  we got a call from the school. One of our daughters had gotten into a spat. And suddenly we were worried  like  do we have a mean girl on our hands  And we didn't really know what to do  so we called her into my office. The family mission statement was on the wall  and my wife said   So  anything up there seem to apply   And she kind of looked down the list  and she said   Bring people together   Suddenly we had a way into the conversation. Another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from. Researchers at Emory gave children a simple  what do you know  test. Do you know where your grandparents were born  Do you know where your parents went to high school  Do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation  an illness  and they overcame it  The children who scored highest on this  do you know  scale had the highest self esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives. The  do you know  test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness. As the author of the study told me  children who have a sense of    they're part of a larger narrative have greater self confidence. So my final plank is  tell your story. Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones. If you give children this happy narrative  you give them the tools to make themselves happier. I was a teenager when I first read  Anna Karenina  and its famous opening sentence   All happy families are alike. Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.  When I first read that  I thought   That sentence is inane. Of course all happy families aren't alike.  But as I began working on this project  I began changing my mind. Recent scholarship has allowed us  for the first time  to identify the building blocks that successful families have. I've mentioned just three here today  Adapt all the time  empower the children  tell your story. Is it possible  all these years later  to say Tolstoy was right  The answer  I believe  is yes. When Leo Tolstoy was five years old  his brother Nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick  which he had hidden in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia. If the stick were ever found  all humankind would be happy. Tolstoy became consumed with that stick  but he never found it. In fact  he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden. He still lies there today  covered in a layer of green grass. That story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that I learned  Happiness is not something we find  it's something we make. Almost anybody who's looked at well run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion. Greatness is not a matter of circumstance. It's a matter of choice. You don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall. You just need to take small steps  accumulate small wins  keep reaching for that green stick. In the end  this may be the greatest lesson of all. What's the secret to a happy family  Try. What is going to be the future of learning  I do have a plan  but in order for me to tell you what that plan is  I need to tell you a little story  which kind of sets the stage. I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools  where did it come from  And you can look far back into the past  but if you look at present day schooling the way it is  it's quite easy to figure out where it came from. It came from about     years ago  and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet.   The British Empire   Imagine trying to run the show  trying to run the entire planet  without computers  without telephones  with data handwritten on pieces of paper  and traveling by ships. But the Victorians actually did it. What they did was amazing. They created a global computer made up of people. It's still with us today. It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine. In order to have that machine running  you need lots and lots of people. They made another machine to produce those people  the school. The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine. They must be identical to each other. They must know three things  They must have good handwriting  because the data is handwritten  they must be able to read  and they must be able to do multiplication  division  addition and subtraction in their head. They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand and ship them to Canada and he would be instantly functional. The Victorians were great engineers. They engineered a system that was so robust that it's still with us today  continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists. The empire is gone  so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people  and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it    Schools as we know them are obsolete   So that's a pretty strong comment there. I said schools as we know them now  they're obsolete. I'm not saying they're broken. It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken. It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed. It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated. What are the kind of jobs that we have today  Well  the clerks are the computers. They're there in thousands in every office. And you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs. Those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand. They don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads. They do need to be able to read. In fact  they need to be able to read discerningly. Well  that's today  but we don't even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like. We know that people will work from wherever they want  whenever they want  in whatever way they want. How is present day schooling going to prepare them for that world  Well  I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident. I used to teach people how to write computer programs in New Delhi     years ago. And right next to where I used to work  there was a slum. And I used to think  how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs  Or should they not  At the same time  we also had lots of parents  rich people  who had computers  and who used to tell me   You know  my son  I think he's gifted  because he does wonderful things with computers. And my daughter    oh  surely she is extra intelligent.  And so on. So I suddenly figured that  how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children  What did the poor do wrong  I made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office  and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one  didn't know any English  didn't know what the Internet was. The children came running in. It was three feet off the ground  and they said   What is this   And I said   Yeah  it's  I don't know.  They said   Why have you put it there   I said   Just like that.  And they said   Can we touch it  I said   If you wish to.  And I went away. About eight hours later  we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse. So I said   Well that's impossible  because    How is it possible  They don't know anything.  My colleagues said   No  it's a simple solution. One of your students must have been passing by  showed them how to use the mouse.  So I said   Yeah  that's possible.  So I repeated the experiment. I went     miles out of Delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little.  Laughter  I repeated the experiment there. There was no place to stay  so I stuck my computer in  I went away  came back after a couple of months  found kids playing games on it. When they saw me  they said   We want a faster processor and a better mouse.  So I said   How on Earth do you know all this   And they said something very interesting to me. In an irritated voice  they said   You've given us a machine that works only in English  so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it.   Laughter  That's the first time  as a teacher  that I had heard the word  teach ourselves  said so casually. Here's a short glimpse from those years. That's the first day at the Hole in the Wall. On your right is an eight year old. To his left is his student. She's six. And he's teaching her how to browse. Then onto other parts of the country  I repeated this over and over again  getting exactly the same results that we were.   Hole in the wall film          An eight year old telling his elder sister what to do. And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is  and said   There's a processor inside.  So I started publishing. I published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything  and I said  in nine months  a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West. I'd seen it happen over and over and over again. But I was curious to know  what else would they do if they could do this much  I started experimenting with other subjects  among them  for example  pronunciation. There's one community of children in southern India whose English pronunciation is really bad  and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs. I gave them a speech to text engine in a computer  and I said   Keep talking into it until it types what you say.  They did that  and watch a little bit of this. Computer  Nice to meet you.Child  Nice to meet you. Sugata Mitra  The reason I ended with the face of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her. She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad and may have tortured you about your credit card bills in a very clear English accent. So then people said  well  how far will it go  Where does it stop  I decided I would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition. I made a hypothesis  a ridiculous hypothesis. Tamil is a south Indian language  and I said  can Tamil speaking children in a south Indian village learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English from a streetside computer  And I said  I'll measure them. They'll get a zero. I'll spend a couple of months  I'll leave it for a couple of months  I'll go back  they'll get another zero. I'll go back to the lab and say  we need teachers. I found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India. I put in Hole in the Wall computers there  downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication  most of which I didn't understand. The children came rushing  said   What's all this   So I said   It's very topical  very important. But it's all in English.  So they said   How can we understand such big English words and diagrams and chemistry   So by now  I had developed a new pedagogical method  so I applied that. I said   I haven't the foggiest idea.   And anyway  I am going away.  So I left them for a couple of months. They'd got a zero. I gave them a test. I came back after two months and the children trooped in and said   We've understood nothing.  So I said   Well  what did I expect   So I said   Okay  but how long did it take you before you decided that you can't understand anything   So they said   We haven't given up. We look at it every single day.  So I said   What  You don't understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months  What for   So a little girl who you see just now  she raised her hand  and she says to me in broken Tamil and English  she said   Well  apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease  we haven't understood anything else.  So I tested them. I got an educational impossibility  zero to    percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know doing something that's a decade ahead of their time. Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm. Thirty percent is a fail. How do I get them to pass  I have to get them    more marks. I couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had  a    year old girl who was an accountant and she played with them all the time. So I asked this girl   Can you help them   So she says   Absolutely not. I didn't have science in school. I have no idea what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you.  I said   I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother.  So she says   What's that   I said   Stand behind them. Whenever they do anything  you just say  'Well  wow  I mean  how did you do that  What's the next page  Gosh  when I was your age  I could have never done that.' You know what grannies do.  So she did that for two more months. The scores jumped to    percent. Kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in New Delhi  a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher. When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field. Here's Kallikuppam. I got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff  but what she was saying  as you could make out  was about neurons  with her hands were like that  and she was saying neurons communicate. At   . So what are jobs going to be like  Well  we know what they're like today. What's learning going to be like  We know what it's like today  children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand. What will it be tomorrow  Could it be that we don't need to go to school at all  Could it be that  at the point in time when you need to know something  you can find out in two minutes  Could it be    a devastating question  a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte    could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete  But that's terrible. We are homo sapiens. Knowing  that's what distinguishes us from the apes. But look at it this way. It took nature     million years to make the ape stand up and become Homo sapiens. It took us only        to make knowing obsolete. What an achievement that is. But we have to integrate that into our own future. Encouragement seems to be the key. If you look at Kuppam  if you look at all of the experiments that I did  it was simply saying   Wow   saluting learning. There is evidence from neuroscience. The reptilian part of our brain  which sits in the center of our brain  when it's threatened  it shuts down everything else  it shuts down the prefrontal cortex  the parts which learn  it shuts all of that down. Punishment and examinations are seen as threats. We take our children  we make them shut their brains down  and then we say   Perform.  Why did they create a system like that  Because it was needed. There was an age in the Age of Empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat. When you're standing in a trench all alone  if you could have survived  you're okay  you've passed. If you didn't  you failed. But the Age of Empires is gone. What happens to creativity in our age  We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure. I came back to England looking for British grandmothers. I put out notices in papers saying  if you are a British grandmother  if you have broadband and a web camera  can you give me one hour of your time per week for free  I got     in the first two weeks. I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe.  Laughter  They're called the Granny Cloud. The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet. If there's a child in trouble  we beam a Gran. She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out. I've seen them do it from a village called Diggles in northwestern England  deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu  India        miles away. She does it with only one age old gesture.  Shhh.  Okay  Watch this. Grandmother  You can't catch me. You say it. You can't catch me. Children  You can't catch me. Grandmother  I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children  I'm the Gingerbread Man. Grandmother  Well done  Very good. SM  So what's happening here  I think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational self organization. If you allow the educational process to self organize  then learning emerges. It's not about making learning happen. It's about letting it happen. The teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens. I think that's what all this is pointing at. But how will we know  How will we come to know  Well  I intend to build these Self Organized Learning Environments. They are basically broadband  collaboration and encouragement put together. I've tried this in many  many schools. It's been tried all over the world  and teachers sort of stand back and say   It just happens by itself   And I said   Yeah  it happens by itself.  How did you know that   I said   You won't believe the children who told me and where they're from.  Here's a SOLE in action. This one is in England. He maintains law and order  because remember  there's no teacher around. Girl  The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons    SM  Australia Girl     giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge. The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons. SM  A decade ahead of her time. So SOLEs  I think we need a curriculum of big questions. You already heard about that. You know what that means. There was a time when Stone Age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say   What are those twinkling lights   They built the first curriculum  but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions. We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle. But that's not sexy enough. The way you would put it to a nine year old is to say   If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth  how would you figure out if it was going to or not   And if he says   Well  what  how   you say   There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle   and leave him alone. He'll figure it out. So here are a couple of images from SOLEs. I've tried incredible  incredible questions     When did the world begin  How will it end     to nine year olds. This one is about what happens to the air we breathe. This is done by children without the help of any teacher. The teacher only raises the question  and then stands back and admires the answer. So what's my wish  My wish is that we design the future of learning. We don't want to be spare parts for a great human computer  do we  So we need to design a future for learning. And I've got to    hang on  I've got to get this wording exactly right  because  you know  it's very important. My wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together. Help me build this school. It will be called the School in the Cloud. It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in. The way I want to do this is to build a facility where I can study this. It's a facility which is practically unmanned. There's only one granny who manages health and safety. The rest of it's from the cloud. The lights are turned on and off by the cloud  etc.  etc.  everything's done from the cloud. But I want you for another purpose. You can do Self Organized Learning Environments at home  in the school  outside of school  in clubs. It's very easy to do. There's a great document produced by TED which tells you how to do it. If you would please  please do it across all five continents and send me the data  then I'll put it all together  move it into the School of Clouds  and create the future of learning. That's my wish. And just one last thing. I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas. At        feet  where the air is thin  I once built two Hole in the Wall computers  and the children flocked there. And there was this little girl who was following me around. And I said to her   You know  I want to give a computer to everybody  every child. I don't know  what should I do   And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly. She suddenly raised her hand like this  and said to me   Get on with it.  I think it was good advice. I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much. Wow.  Applause  Well  I was introduced as the former Governor of Michigan  but actually I'm a scientist. All right  a political scientist  it doesn't really count  but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is Michigan  and  like any good scientist  I was experimenting with policy about what would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. But there were three problems  three enigmas that I could not solve  and I want to share with you those problems  but most importantly  I think I figured out a proposal for a solution. The first problem that not just Michigan  but every state  faces is  how do you create good jobs in America in a global economy  So let me share with you some empirical data from my lab. I was elected in      and  at the end of my first year in office in       I got a call from one of my staff members  who said   Gov  we have a big problem. We have a little tiny community called Greenville  Michigan  population        and they are about to lose their major employer  which is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux.  And I said   Well  how many people work at Electrolux   And he said         of the       people in Greenville.  So it is a one company town. And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico. So I said   Forget that. I'm the new Governor. We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse.  So I brought my whole cabinet  and we met with all of the pooh bahs of little Greenville    the mayor  the city manager  the head of the community college    and we basically emptied our pockets and put all of our chips on the table  incentives  you name it  to convince Electrolux to stay  and as we made our pile of chips  we slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux. And in the pile were things like zero taxes for    years  or that we'd help to build a new factory for the company  we'd help to finance it. The UAW  who represented the workers  said they would offer unprecedented concessions  sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville. So the management of Electrolux took our pile  our list of incentives  and they went outside the room for    minutes  and they came back in and they said   Wow  this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here. But there's nothing you can do to compensate for the fact that we can pay   .   an hour in Juarez  Mexico. So we're leaving.  And they did. And when they did  it was like a nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville. In fact  they did implode the factory. That's a guy that is walking on his last day of work. And on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line  the employees of Electrolux in Greenville  Michigan  had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper. It was in a big pavilion in Greenville  an indoor pavilion  and I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor that I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs  and I wanted to grieve with them  and as I went into the room   there's thousands of people there. It was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches on roundtop tables  and there was a sad band playing music  or a band playing sad music  probably both.  Laughter  And this guy comes up to me  and he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on  and he had his two daughters with him  and he said   Gov  these are my two daughters.  He said   I'm    years old  and I have worked at this factory for    years. I went from high school to factory. My father worked at this factory   he said.  My grandfather worked at this factory. All I know is how to make refrigerators.  And he looked at his daughters  and he puts his hand on his chest  and he says   So  Gov  tell me  who is ever going to hire me  Who is ever going to hire me   And that was asked not just by that guy but by everyone in the pavilion  and frankly  by every worker at one of the        factories that closed in the first decade of this century. Enigma number one  How do you create jobs in America in a global economy  Number two  very quickly  How do you solve global climate change when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm  In fact  there was a poll that was done recently and the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings to a number of other unpleasant things  and it was found  in fact  that Congress's approval rating is worse than cockroaches  lice  Nickelback the band  root canals and Donald Trump.  Laughter  But wait  the good news is it's at least better than meth labs and gonorrhea.  Laughter  We got a problem  folks. So it got me thinking  what is it  What in the laboratory that I see out there  the laboratories of democracy  what has happened  What policy prescriptions have happened that actually cause changes to occur and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way  So if I asked you  for example  what was the Obama Administration policy that caused massive changes across the country  what would you say  You might say Obamacare  except for those were not voluntary changes. As we know  only half the states have opted in. We might say the Recovery Act  but those didn't require policy changes. The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was Race to the Top for education. Why  The government put a   .  billion pot and said to the governors across the country  compete for it. Forty eight governors competed  convincing    state legislatures to essentially raise standards for high schoolers so that they all take a college prep curriculum. Forty eight states opted in  creating a national  education  policy from the bottom up. So I thought  well  why can't we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs race to the top  Because after all  if you look at the context   .  trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years from the private sector globally  and every dollar represents a job  and where are those jobs going  Well  they're going to places that have policy  like China. In fact  I was in China to see what they were doing  and they were putting on a dog and pony show for the group that I was with  and I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations and standing next to one of the Chinese officials  and we were watching  and he says   So  Gov  when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy   And I said   Oh my God    Congress  gridlock  who knows   And this is what he did  he goes  he says   Take your time.  Because they see our passivity as their opportunity. So what if we decided to create a challenge to the governors of the country  and the price to entry into this competition used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress for the Race to the Top for education   .  billion  which sounds like a lot  but actually it's less than one tenth of one percent of federal spending. It's a rounding error on the federal side. But price to entry into that competition would be  you could just  say  use the President's goal. He wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard of    percent by       in other words  that you'd have to get    percent of your energy from clean sources by the year     . Why not ask all of the states to do that instead  And imagine what might happen  because every region has something to offer. You might take states like Iowa and Ohio    two very important political states  by the way    those two governors  and they would say  we're going to lead the nation in producing the wind turbines and the wind energy. You might say the solar states  the sun belt  we're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country  and maybe Jerry Brown says   Well  I'm going to create an industry cluster in California to be able to produce the solar panels so that we're not buying them from China but we're buying them from the U.S.  In fact  every region of the country could do this. You see  you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation. In fact  if you look just at the upper and northern states in the West  they could do geothermal  or you could look at Texas and say  we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid. In the middle eastern states which have access to forests and to agricultural waste  they might say  we're going to lead the nation in biofuels. In the upper northeast  we're going to lead the nation in energy efficiency solutions. Along the eastern seaboard  we're going to lead the nation in offshore wind. You might look at Michigan and say  we're going to lead the nation in producing the guts for the electric vehicle  like the lithium ion battery. Every region has something to offer  and if you created a competition  it respects the states and it respects federalism. It's opt in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina  who didn't opt into the education Race to the Top  you might even get them to opt in. Why  Because Republican and Democratic governors love to cut ribbons. We want to bring jobs. I'm just saying. And it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy. Now  any of you who are watching anything about politics lately might say   Okay  great idea  but really  Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table  They can't agree to anything.  So you could wait and go through Congress  although you should be very impatient. Or  you renegades  we could go around Congress. Go around Congress. What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors  What if several of the high net worth companies and individuals who are here at TED decided that they would create  band together  just a couple of them  and create a national competition to the governors to have a race to the top and see how the governors respond  What if it all started here at TED  What if you were here when we figured out how to crack the code to create good paying jobs in America     Applause     and get national energy policy and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up  Because  dear TEDsters  if you are impatient like I am  you know that our economic competitors  our other nations  are in the game and are eating us for lunch. And we can get in the game or not. We can be at the table or we can be on the table. And I don't know about you  but I prefer to dine. Thank you all so much.  Applause  So  I didn't always make my living from music. For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university  this was my day job. I was a self employed living statue called the Eight Foot Bride  and I love telling people I did this for a job  because everybody always wants to know  who are these freaks in real life. Hello. I painted myself white one day  stood on a box  put a hat or a can at my feet  and when someone came by and dropped in money  I handed them a flower    and some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower  I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing    as they walked away. So I had the most profound encounters with people  especially lonely people who looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks  and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street  and we would sort of fall in love a little bit. And my eyes would say     Thank you. I see you.  And their eyes would say     Nobody ever sees me. Thank you.  I would get harassed sometimes. People would yell at me from their cars.  Get a job    This is my job.  But it hurt  because it made me fear that I was somehow doing something un joblike and unfair  shameful. I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box. And for the economists out there  you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income  which was shocking to me  given I had no regular customers  but pretty much    bucks on a Tuesday     bucks on a Friday. It was consistent. And meanwhile  I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band  the Dresden Dolls. This was me on piano  a genius drummer. I wrote the songs  and eventually we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue  and as we started touring  I really didn't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people  because I loved it. So after all of our shows  we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people  and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us  and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows  and they would pass the hat  and then they would come in and join us onstage  so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird  random circus guests. And then Twitter came along  and made things even more magic  because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere. So I would need a piano to practice on  and an hour later I would be at a fan's house. This is in London. People would bring home cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us. This is in Seattle. Fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last minute  spontaneous  free gig. This is a library in Auckland. On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat  because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast  and they showed up care of this dude  Chris  from Newport Beach  who says hello. I once tweeted   Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot   And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in  and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death. And I love this kind of random closeness  which is lucky  because I do a lot of couchsurfing. In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there's no wireless  and in punk squats  everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless  clearly making it the better option. My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an    year old girl  still living at home  and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras. And that night  her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds. And I lay there thinking  these people have so little. Is this fair  And in the morning  her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible  and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English   Your music has helped my daughter so much. Thank you for staying here. We're all so grateful.  And I thought  this is fair. This is this. A couple of months later  I was in Manhattan  and I tweeted for a crash pad  and at midnight  I'm on the Lower East Side  and it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone. I've always been with my band or my crew. Is this what stupid people do  Is this how stupid people die  And before I can change my mind  the door busts open. She's an artist. He's a financial blogger for Reuters  and they're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath  and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that. So I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot. I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing. You're falling into the audience and you're trusting each other. I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get some extra money  something that I did a lot. And as usual  the band was psyched  but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there. It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat. And I recognized his fear of  Is this fair   and  Get a job.  And meanwhile  my band is becoming bigger and bigger. We sign with a major label. And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret. It's not for everybody. Well  maybe it's for you. We sign  and there's all this hype leading up to our next record. And it comes out and it sells about        copies in the first few weeks  and the label considers this a failure. I was like           isn't that a lot   They said   No  the sales are going down. It's a failure.  And they walk off. Right at this same time  I'm signing and hugging after a gig  and a guy comes up to me and hands me a     bill  and he says   I'm sorry  I burned your CD from a friend.   But I read your blog  I know you hate your label. I just want you to have this money.  And this starts happening all the time. I become the hat after my own gigs  but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people  and unlike the guy in the opening band  I've actually had a lot of practice standing there. Thank you. And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible  so it's like Metallica over here  Napster  bad  Amanda Palmer over here  and I'm going to encourage torrenting  downloading  sharing  but I'm going to ask for help  because I saw it work on the street. So I fought my way off my label  and for my next project with my new band  the Grand Theft Orchestra  I turned to crowdfunding. And I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made  and I asked my crowd to catch me. And the goal was         dollars. My fans backed me at nearly  .  million  which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date. And you can see how many people it is. It's about        people. And the media asked   Amanda  the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy. How did you make all these people pay for music   And the real answer is  I didn't make them. I asked them. And through the very act of asking people  I'd connected with them  and when you connect with them  people want to help you. It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists. They don't want to ask for things. But it's not easy. It's not easy to ask. And a lot of artists have a problem with this. Asking makes you vulnerable. And I got a lot of criticism online  after my Kickstarter went big  for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices  specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer  and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website. And this hurt in a really familiar way. And people saying   You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help   really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling   Get a job.  Because they weren't with us on the sidewalk  and they couldn't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd  an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them. So this is slightly not safe for work. This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin. At the end of the night  I stripped and let everyone draw on me. Now let me tell you  if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers    I recommend this  especially if those strangers are drunk German people. This was a ninja master level fan connection  because what I was really saying here was  I trust you this much. Should I  Show me. For most of human history  musicians  artists  they've been part of the community. Connectors and openers  not untouchable stars. Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance  but the Internet and the content that we're freely able to share on it are taking us back. It's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough. So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price. They see it as an unpredictable risk  but the things I've done  the Kickstarter  the street  the doorbell  I don't see these things as risk. I see them as trust. Now  the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street  they're getting there. But the perfect tools aren't going to help us if we can't face each other and give and receive fearlessly  but  more important    to ask without shame. My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box. So blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers  our mistakes  and we see each other. And I think when we really see each other  we want to help each other. I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question  which is   How do we make people pay for music   What if we started asking   How do we let people pay for music   Thank you. The most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us. This perfect storm is mounting a grim reality  increasingly grim reality  and we are facing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology  and that's very understandable. Now  this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population  rising towards    billion people  land that is turning to desert  and  of course  climate change. Now there's no question about it at all  we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology. But fossil fuels  carbon    coal and gas    are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change. Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert  and this happens only when we create too much bare ground. There's no other cause. And I intend to focus on most of the world's land that is turning to desert. But I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine. We have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year. On those  it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground. No matter what you do  nature covers it up so quickly. And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness  and that is where desertification is occurring. Fortunately  with space technology now  we can look at it from space  and when we do  you can see the proportions fairly well. Generally  what you see in green is not desertifying  and what you see in brown is  and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth. About two thirds  I would guess  of the world is desertifying. I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while    millimeters    that's an inch of rain    was falling. Think of it in terms of drums of water  each containing     liters. Over       drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day. The next day  the land looked like this. Where had that water gone  Some of it ran off as flooding  but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again  exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered. Now  because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter  when we damage soils  you give off carbon. Carbon goes back to the atmosphere. Now you're told over and over  repeatedly  that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi arid areas of the world  and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence. But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them  you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae  leading to increased runoff and evaporation. That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form. Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock  mostly cattle  sheep and goats  overgrazing the plants  leaving the soil bare and giving off methane. Almost everybody knows this  from nobel laureates to golf caddies  or was taught it  as I was. Now  the environments like you see here  dusty environments in Africa where I grew up  and I loved wildlife  and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing. And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs. Well  I have news for you. We were once just as certain that the world was flat. We were wrong then  and we are wrong again. And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery. When I was a young man  a young biologist in Africa  I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks. Now no sooner   this was in the     s   and no sooner did we remove the hunting  drum beating people to protect the animals  than the land began to deteriorate  as you see in this park that we formed. Now  no livestock were involved  but suspecting that we had too many elephants now  I did the research and I proved we had too many  and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain. Now  that was a terrible decision for me to have to make  and it was political dynamite  frankly. So our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research. They did. They agreed with me  and over the following years  we shot        elephants to try to stop the damage. And it got worse  not better. Loving elephants as I do  that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life  and I will carry that to my grave. One good thing did come out of it. It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions. When I came to the United States  I got a shock  to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in Africa. And there'd been no livestock on this land for over    years. And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural. So I then began looking at all the research plots I could over the whole of the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification  but I found the opposite  as we see on this research station  where this grassland that was green in       by      had changed to that situation. And the authors of the position paper on climate change from which I obtained these pictures attribute this change to  unknown processes.  Clearly  we have never understood what is causing desertification  which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally. We have never understood it. Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here  and I promise you  you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter  plant litter. You have changed the microclimate. Now  by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world's land  you are changing macroclimate. But we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen        years ago  Why has it accelerated lately  We had no understanding of that. What we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world  the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals  and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious pack hunting predators. Now  the main defense against pack hunting predators is to get into herds  and the larger the herd  the safer the individuals. Now  large herds dung and urinate all over their own food  and they have to keep moving  and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants  while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil  as we see where a herd has passed. This picture is a typical seasonal grassland. It has just come through four months of rain  and it's now going into eight months of dry season. And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season. Now  all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season  and if it doesn't  the grassland and the soil begin to die. Now  if it does not decay biologically  it shifts to oxidation  which is a very slow process  and this smothers and kills grasses  leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil  releasing carbon. To prevent that  we have traditionally used fire. But fire also leaves the soil bare  releasing carbon  and worse than that  burning one hectare of grassland gives off more  and more damaging  pollutants than       cars. And we are burning in Africa  every single year  more than one billion hectares of grasslands  and almost nobody is talking about it. We justify the burning  as scientists  because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow. Now  looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry  what could we do to keep that healthy  And bear in mind  I'm talking of most of the world's land now. Okay  We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change. We cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change. What are we going to do  There is only one option  I'll repeat to you  only one option left to climatologists and scientists  and that is to do the unthinkable  and to use livestock  bunched and moving  as a proxy for former herds and predators  and mimic nature. There is no other alternative left to mankind. So let's do that. So on this bit of grassland  we'll do it  but just in the foreground. We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature  and we've done so  and look at that. All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung  urine and litter or mulch  as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand  and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain  to store carbon  and to break down methane. And we did that  without using fire to damage the soil  and the plants are free to grow. When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification  I was faced with a real dilemma. How were we to do it  We'd had        years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals  but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world. Then we'd had     years of modern rain science  and that had accelerated desertification  as we first discovered in Africa and then confirmed in the United States  and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government. Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals  and humans  over thousands of years  had never been able to deal with nature's complexity. But we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this. So rather than reinvent the wheel  I began studying other professions to see if anybody had. And I found there were planning techniques that I could take and adapt to our biological need  and from those I developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing  a planning process  and that does address all of nature's complexity and our social  environmental  economic complexity. Today  we have young women like this one teaching villages in Africa how to put their animals together into larger herds  plan their grazing to mimic nature  and where we have them hold their animals overnight    we run them in a predator friendly manner  because we have a lot of lands  and so on    and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields  we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well. Let's look at some results. This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe. It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year  and it's going into the long dry season. But as you can see  all of that rain  almost of all it  has evaporated from the soil surface. Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended  and we have         people on almost permanent food aid. Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day  with the same rainfall  and look at that. Our river is flowing and healthy and clean. It's fine. The production of grass  shrubs  trees  wildlife  everything is now more productive  and we have virtually no fear of dry years. And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats     percent  planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants  buffalo  giraffe and other animals that we have. But before we began  our land looked like that. This site was bare and eroding for over    years regardless of what rain we got. Okay  Watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature. This was another site where it had been bare and eroding  and at the base of the marked small tree  we had lost over    centimeters of soil. Okay  And again  watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature. And there are fallen trees in there now  because the better land is now attracting elephants  etc. This land in Mexico was in terrible condition  and I've had to mark the hill because the change is so profound. I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the     s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland  and thankfully  now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future. And look at the amazing change in this one  where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature  and once more  we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying. The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here. The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher  and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers. They put        sheep in one flock  really mimicking nature now with planned grazing  and they have documented a    percent increase in the production of the land in the first year. We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture. Ninety five percent of that land can only feed people from animals. I remind you that I am talking about most of the world's land here that controls our fate  including the most violent region of the world  where only animals can feed people from about    percent of the land. What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as  I believe  fossil fuels  and maybe more than fossil fuels. But worse than that  it is causing hunger  poverty  violence  social breakdown and war  and as I am talking to you  millions of men  women and children are suffering and dying. And if this continues  we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing  even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels. I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this. We are already doing so on about    million hectares on five continents  and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that  for illustrative purposes  if we do what I am showing you here  we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years  and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands that I've shown you  we can take us back to pre industrial levels  while feeding people. I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet  for your children  and their children  and all of humanity. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you  Chris. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I have  and I'm sure everyone here has  A  a hundred questions  B  wants to hug you. I'm just going to ask you one quick question. When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals  it's desert. What do they eat  How does that part work  How do you start  Allan Savory  Well  we have done this for a long time  and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation  where it's     percent bare. But many years ago  we took the worst land in Zimbabwe  where I offered a    note in a hundred mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred mile drive  and on that  we trebled the stocking rate  the number of animals  in the first year with no feeding  just by the movement  mimicking nature  and using a sigmoid curve  that principle. It's a little bit technical to explain here  but just that. CA  Well  I would love to    I mean  this such an interesting and important idea. The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and    I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.AS  Wonderful. CA  That is an astonishing talk  truly an astonishing talk  and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way. Thank you so much.AS  Well  thank you. Thank you. Thank you  Chris. The Kraken  a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales  and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island. In assessing the merits of such tales  it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins   Once upon a time   and a sea story begins   This ain't no shit.   Laughter  Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale. Nevertheless  there are giants in the ocean  and we now have video proof  as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware. I was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off Japan. I'm the short one. The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea. I owe my participation in this now historic event to TED. In       there was a TED event called Mission Blue held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish. I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean  one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away. Mike deGruy was also invited  and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean  and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he's been involved with for a very long time  which is the hunt for the giant squid. It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit  a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week.  Laughter  I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which I emphasized the importance of using quiet  unobtrusive platforms for exploration. This came out of hundreds of dives I have made  farting around in the dark using these platforms  and my impression that I saw more animals working from the submersible than I did with either of the remote operated vehicles. But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view. But I also felt like I saw more animals working with the Tiburon than the Ventana  two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems. So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make. So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean  and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made. The Johnson Sea Link     whirring noise     which you can probably just barely hear here  uses electric thrusters    very  very quiet. The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters. It's also pretty quiet  but a bit noisier.  Louder whirring noise  But most deep diving ROVs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the Ventana.  Loud beeping noise  I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away. So for the deep sea squid hunt  I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters  no motors  just a battery powered camera  and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue. That's visible to our eye  but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea. So this camera platform  which we called the Medusa  could just be thrown off the back of the ship  attached to a float at the surface with over       feet of line  it would just float around passively carried by the currents  and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure  which we called the electronic jellyfish  or e jelly  because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla. Now  this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense. The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish  but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape. It's a scream for help  a last ditch attempt for escape  and a common form of defense in the deep sea. The approach worked. Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant  we managed six  and the first triggered wild excitement. Edith Widder  on video   Oh my God. Oh my God  Are you kidding me Other scientists  Oh ho ho  That's just hanging there. EW  It was like it was teasing us  doing a kind of fan dance    now you see me  now you don't    and we had four such teasing appearances  and then on the fifth  it came in and totally wowed us. Scientists  Ooh. Bang  Oh my God  Whoa  EW  The full monty. What really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it  which I think it mistook for the predator on the e jelly. But even more incredible was the footage shot from the Triton submersible. What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used  a one meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it  a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use  and I think it was this light that brought the giant in. Now  what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light  and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here. And then he got so excited  he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better  and the giant didn't run away  so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible  bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high resolution video. It was absolutely breathtaking  and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended  it would have been as tall as a two story house. How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now  We've only explored about five percent of our ocean. There are great discoveries yet to be made down there  fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine. Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we've spent on space exploration. We need a NASA like organization for ocean exploration  because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on Earth. We need   thank you.  Applause  Exploration is the engine that drives innovation. Innovation drives economic growth. So let's all go exploring  but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away  or  as Mike deGruy once said   If you want to get away from it all and see something you've never seen  or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen  get in a sub.  He should have been with us for this adventure. We miss him. I live in South Central. This is South Central  liquor stores  fast food  vacant lots. So the city planners  they get together and they figure they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else  so they change it to South Los Angeles  like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city. This is South Los Angeles.  Laughter  Liquor stores  fast food  vacant lots. Just like   .  million other Americans  I live in a food desert  South Central Los Angeles  home of the drive thru and the drive by. Funny thing is  the drive thrus are killing more people than the drive bys. People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles. For instance  the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than  say  Beverly Hills  which is probably eight     miles away. I got tired of seeing this happening. And I was wondering  how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food  if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood  I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars. I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks. And I figured  this has to stop. So I figured that the problem is the solution. Food is the problem and food is the solution. Plus I got tired of driving    minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides. So what I did  I planted a food forest in front of my house. It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway. It's     feet by    feet. Thing is  it's owned by the city. But you have to maintain it. So I'm like   Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want  since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it.  And this is how I decided to maintain it. So me and my group  L.A. Green Grounds  we got together and we started planting my food forest  fruit trees  you know  the whole nine  vegetables. What we do  we're a pay it forward kind of group  where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life  from all over the city  and it's completely volunteer  and everything we do is free. And the garden  it was beautiful. And then somebody complained. The city came down on me  and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden  which this citation was turning into a warrant. And I'm like   Come on  really  A warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about    Laughter  And I was like   Cool. Bring it.  Because this time it wasn't coming up. So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman  and one of the Green Grounds members  they put up a petition on Change.org  and with     signatures  we were a success. We had a victory on our hands. My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we're doing. I mean  come on  why wouldn't they  L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns. They own    square miles of vacant lots. That's    Central Parks. That's enough space to plant     million tomato plants. Why in the hell would they not okay this  Growing one plant will give you               seeds. When one dollar's worth of green beans will give you    dollars' worth of produce. It's my gospel  when I'm telling people  grow your own food. Growing your own food is like printing your own money. See  I have a legacy in South Central. I grew up there. I raised my sons there. And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people  and I'm manufacturing my own reality. See  I'm an artist. Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art. Just like a graffiti artist  where they beautify walls  me  I beautify lawns  parkways. I use the garden  the soil  like it's a piece of cloth  and the plants and the trees  that's my embellishment for that cloth. You'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas. You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people. So what happened  I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education  a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood. To change the community  you have to change the composition of the soil. We are the soil. You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this. Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do  especially in the inner city. Plus you get strawberries. I remember this time  there was this mother and a daughter came  it was  like        at night  and they were in my yard  and I came out and they looked so ashamed. So I'm like  man  it made me feel bad that they were there  and I told them  you know  you don't have to do this like this. This is on the street for a reason. It made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry  and this only reinforced why I do this  and people asked me   Fin  aren't you afraid people are going to steal your food   And I'm like   Hell no  I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it. That's why it's on the street. That's the whole idea. I want them to take it  but at the same time  I want them to take back their health.  There's another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles. These are the guys  they helped me unload the truck. It was cool  and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother  and it was just cool to see how this changed them  if it was only for that one moment. So Green Grounds has gone on to plant maybe    gardens. We've had  like     people come to our dig ins and participate  and it's all volunteers. If kids grow kale  kids eat kale. If they grow tomatoes  they eat tomatoes.  Applause  But when none of this is presented to them  if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body  they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them. I see young people and they want to work  but they're in this thing where they're caught up    I see kids of color and they're just on this track that's designed for them  that leads them to nowhere. So with gardening  I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities  to have a sustainable life. And when we do this  who knows  We might produce the next George Washington Carver. but if we don't change the composition of the soil  we will never do this. Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do. I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block. I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not talking about no free shit  because free is not sustainable. The funny thing about sustainability  you have to sustain it. What I'm talking about is putting people to work  and getting kids off the street  and letting them know the joy  the pride and the honor in growing your own food  opening farmer's markets. So what I want to do here  we gotta make this sexy. So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades  gangstas  gangsta gardeners. We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is. If you ain't a gardener  you ain't gangsta. Get gangsta with your shovel  okay  And let that be your weapon of choice. So basically  if you want to meet with me  you know  if you want to meet  don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit    where you talk about doing some shit. If you want to meet with me  come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit. Peace. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  There's a group of people in Kenya. People cross oceans to go see them. These people are tall. They jump high. They wear red. And they kill lions. You might be wondering  who are these people  These are the Maasais. And you know what's cool  I'm actually one of them. The Maasais  the boys are brought up to be warriors. The girls are brought up to be mothers. When I was five years old  I found out that I was engaged to be married as soon as I reached puberty. My mother  my grandmother  my aunties  they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by. And everything I had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age   . My day started at   in the morning  milking the cows  sweeping the house  cooking for my siblings  collecting water  firewood. I did everything that I needed to do to become a perfect wife. I went to school not because the Maasais' women or girls were going to school. It's because my mother was denied an education  and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living. Why did she say that  My father worked as a policeman in the city. He came home once a year. We didn't see him for sometimes even two years. And whenever he came home  it was a different case. My mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat. She reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us. But when my father came  he would sell the cows  he would sell the products we had  and he went and drank with his friends in the bars. Because my mother was a woman  she was not allowed to own any property  and by default  everything in my family anyway belongs to my father  so he had the right. And if my mother ever questioned him  he beat her  abused her  and really it was difficult. When I went to school  I had a dream. I wanted to become a teacher. Teachers looked nice. They wear nice dresses  high heeled shoes. I found out later that they are uncomfortable  but I admired it. But most of all  the teacher was just writing on the board    not hard work  that's what I thought  compared to what I was doing in the farm. So I wanted to become a teacher. I worked hard in school  but when I was in eighth grade  it was a determining factor. In our tradition  there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women  and it's a rite of passage to womanhood. And then I was just finishing my eighth grade  and that was a transition for me to go to high school. This was the crossroad. Once I go through this tradition  I was going to become a wife. Well  my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass. So I talked    I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out. I talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done. I told my father   I will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school.  The reason why  if I ran away  my father will have a stigma  people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony. It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life. So he figured out.  Well   he said   okay  you'll go to school after the ceremony.  I did. The ceremony happened. It's a whole week long of excitement. It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it. And the day before the actual ceremony happens  we were dancing  having excitement  and through all the night we did not sleep. The actual day came  and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in. Yes  we danced and danced. We walked out to the courtyard  and there were a bunch of people waiting. They were all in a circle. And as we danced and danced  and we approached this circle of women  men  women  children  everybody was there. There was a woman sitting in the middle of it  and this woman was waiting to hold us. I was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls  and as I approached her  she looked at me  and I sat down. And I sat down  and I opened my legs. As I opened my leg  another woman came  and this woman was carrying a knife. And as she carried the knife  she walked toward me and she held the clitoris  and she cut it off. As you can imagine  I bled. I bled. After bleeding for a while  I fainted thereafter. It's something that so many girls    I'm lucky  I never died    but many die. It's practiced  it's no anesthesia  it's a rusty old knife  and it was difficult. I was lucky because one  also  my mom did something that most women don't do. Three days later  after everybody has left the home  my mom went and brought a nurse. We were taken care of. Three weeks later  I was healed  and I was back in high school. I was so determined to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family. Well  while I was in high school  something happened. I met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the University of Oregon. This man was wearing a white t shirt  jeans  camera  white sneakers    and I'm talking about white sneakers. There is something about clothes  I think  and shoes. They were sneakers  and this is in a village that doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive. I told him   Well  I want to go to where you are   because this man looked very happy  and I admired that. And he told me   Well  what do you mean  you want to go  Don't you have a husband waiting for you   And I told him   Don't worry about that part. Just tell me how to get there.  This gentleman  he helped me. While I was in high school also  my dad was sick. He got a stroke  and he was really  really sick  so he really couldn't tell me what to do next. But the problem is  my father is not the only father I have. Everybody who is my dad's age  male in the community  is my father by default    my uncles  all of them    and they dictate what my future is. So the news came  I applied to school and I was accepted to Randolph Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg  Virginia  and I couldn't come without the support of the village  because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket. I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here. But I needed the support of the village  and here again  when the men heard  and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school  they said   What a lost opportunity. This should have been given to a boy. We can't do this.  So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition. There's a belief among our people that morning brings good news. So I had to come up with something to do with the morning  because there's good news in the morning. And in the village also  there is one chief  an elder  who if he says yes  everybody will follow him. So I went to him very early in the morning  as the sun rose. The first thing he sees when he opens his door is  it's me.  My child  what are you doing here    Well  Dad  I need help. Can you support me to go to America   I promised him that I would be the best girl  I will come back  anything they wanted after that  I will do it for them. He said   Well  but I can't do it alone.  He gave me a list of another    men that I went       more men    every single morning I went and visited them. They all came together. The village  the women  the men  everybody came together to support me to come to get an education. I arrived in America. As you can imagine  what did I find  I found snow  I found Wal Marts  vacuum cleaners  and lots of food in the cafeteria. I was in a land of plenty. I enjoyed myself  but during that moment while I was here  I discovered a lot of things. I learned that that ceremony that I went through when I was    years old  it was called female genital mutilation. I learned that it was against the law in Kenya. I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education. I had a right. And as we speak right now  three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation. I learned that my mom had a right to own property. I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman. Those things made me angry. I wanted to do something. As I went back  every time I went  I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married. They were getting mutilated  and here  after I graduated from here  I worked at the U.N.  I went back to school to get my graduate work  the constant cry of these girls was in my face. I had to do something. As I went back  I started talking to the men  to the village  and mothers  and I said   I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you. What do you need   As I spoke to the women  they told me   You know what we need  We really need a school for girls.  Because there had not been any school for girls. And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school  the mother is blamed for that. If she got pregnant before she got married  the mother is blamed for that  and she's punished. She's beaten. They said   We wanted to put our girls in a safe place.  As we moved  and I went to talk to the fathers  the fathers  of course  you can imagine what they said   We want a school for boys.  And I said   Well  there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education. Why can't they build a school for boys  and I'll build a school for girls   That made sense. And they agreed. And I told them  I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment. And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school. We have. I want you to meet one of the girls in that school. Angeline came to apply for the school  and she did not meet any criteria that we had. She's an orphan. Yes  we could have taken her for that. But she was older. She was    years old  and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade. Angeline had been moving from one place    because she's an orphan  she has no mother  she has no father    moving from one grandmother's house to another one  from aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life. And I looked at her  I remember that day  and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline. And yes  she was older to be in fourth grade. We gave her the opportunity to come to the class. Five months later  that is Angeline. A transformation had begun in her life. Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world and make a difference. She was not the top student when we took her. Now she's the best student  not just in our school  but in the entire division that we are in. That's Sharon. That's five years later. That's Evelyn. Five months later  that is the difference that we are making. As a new dawn is happening in my school  a new beginning is happening. As we speak right now      girls will never be mutilated. One hundred twenty five girls will not be married when they're    years old. One hundred twenty five girls are creating and achieving their dreams. This is the thing that we are doing  giving them opportunities where they can rise. As we speak right now  women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we've started in our community. I want to challenge you today. You are listening to me because you are here  very optimistic. You are somebody who is so passionate. You are somebody who wants to see a better world. You are somebody who wants to see that war ends  no poverty. You are somebody who wants to make a difference. You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better. I want to challenge you today that to be the first  because people will follow you. Be the first. People will follow you. Be bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident. Move out  because as you change your world  as you change your community  as we believe that we are impacting one girl  one family  one village  one country at a time. We are making a difference  so if you change your world  you are going to change your community  you are going to change your country  and think about that. If you do that  and I do that  aren't we going to create a better future for our children  for your children  for our grandchildren  And we will live in a very peaceful world. Thank you very much. There's so many of you. When I was a kid  I hid my heart under the bed  because my mother said   If you're not careful  someday someone's going to break it.  Take it from me  Under the bed is not a good hiding spot. I know because I've been shot down so many times  I get altitude sickness just from standing up for myself. But that's what we were told.  Stand up for yourself.  And that's hard to do if you don't know who you are. We were expected to define ourselves at such an early age  and if we didn't do it  others did it for us. Geek. Fatty. Slut. Fag. And at the same time we were being told what we were  we were being asked   What do you want to be when you grow up   I always thought that was an unfair question. It presupposes that we can't be what we already are. We were kids. When I was a kid  I wanted to be a man. I wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet. When I was a kid  I wanted to shave. Now  not so much. When I was eight  I wanted to be a marine biologist. When I was nine  I saw the movie  Jaws   and thought to myself   No  thank you.  And when I was     I was told that my parents left because they didn't want me. When I was     I wanted to be left alone. When I was     I wanted to die. When I was     I wanted to kill a kid. When I was     I was asked to seriously consider a career path. I said   I'd like to be a writer.  And they said   Choose something realistic.  So I said   Professional wrestler.  And they said   Don't be stupid.  See  they asked me what I wanted to be  then told me what not to be. And I wasn't the only one. We were being told that we somehow must become what we are not  sacrificing what we are to inherit the masquerade of what we will be. I was being told to accept the identity that others will give me. And I wondered  what made my dreams so easy to dismiss  Granted  my dreams are shy  because they're Canadian. My dreams are self conscious and overly apologetic. They're standing alone at the high school dance  and they've never been kissed. See  my dreams got called names too. Silly. Foolish. Impossible. But I kept dreaming. I was going to be a wrestler. I had it all figured out. I was going to be The Garbage Man. My finishing move was going to be The Trash Compactor. My saying was going to be   I'm taking out the trash   And then this guy  Duke  The Dumpster  Droese  stole my entire shtick. I was crushed  as if by a trash compactor. I thought to myself   What now  Where do I turn   Poetry. Like a boomerang  the thing I loved came back to me. One of the first lines of poetry I can remember writing was in response to a world that demanded I hate myself. From age    to     I hated myself for becoming the thing that I loathed  a bully. When I was     I wrote   I will love myself despite the ease with which I lean toward the opposite.  Standing up for yourself doesn't have to mean embracing violence. When I was a kid  I traded in homework assignments for friendship  then gave each friend a late slip for never showing up on time  and in most cases  not at all. I gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise. And I remember this plan  born out of frustration from a kid who kept calling me  Yogi   then pointed at my tummy and said   Too many picnic baskets.  Turns out it's not that hard to trick someone  and one day before class  I said   Yeah  you can copy my homework   and I gave him all the wrong answers that I'd written down the night before. He got his paper back expecting a near perfect score  and couldn't believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero. I knew I didn't have to hold up my paper of    out of     but my satisfaction was complete when he looked at me  puzzled  and I thought to myself   Smarter than the average bear  motherfucker.  This is who I am. This is how I stand up for myself. When I was a kid  I used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing. I thought they were both pork chops. My grandmother thought it was cute  and because they were my favorite  she let me keep doing it. Not really a big deal. One day  before I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees  I fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body. I didn't want to tell my grandmother because I was scared I'd get in trouble for playing somewhere I shouldn't have been. The gym teacher noticed the bruise  and I got sent to the principal's office. From there  I was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home. I saw no reason to lie. As far as I was concerned  life was pretty good. I told her  whenever I'm sad  my grandmother gives me karate chops. This led to a full scale investigation  and I was removed from the house for three days  until they finally decided to ask how I got the bruises. News of this silly little story quickly spread through the school  and I earned my first nickname  Porkchop. To this day  I hate pork chops. I'm not the only kid who grew up this way  surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme about sticks and stones  as if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called  and we got called them all. So we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us  that we'd be lonely forever  that we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their toolshed. So broken heartstrings bled the blues  and we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing. Don't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone  that an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away  that there's no way for it to metastasize  it does. She was eight years old  our first day of grade three when she got called ugly. We both got moved to the back of class so we would stop getting bombarded by spitballs. But the school halls were a battleground. We found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day. We used to stay inside for recess  because outside was worse. Outside  we'd have to rehearse running away  or learn to stay still like statues  giving no clues that we were there. In grade five  they taped a sign to the front of her desk that read   Beware of dog.  To this day  despite a loving husband  she doesn't think she's beautiful  because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half her face. Kids used to say   She looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to erase  but couldn't quite get the job done.  And they'll never understand that she's raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word  Mom   because they see her heart before they see her skin  because she's only ever always been amazing. He was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree  adopted  not because his parents opted for a different destiny. He was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy  started therapy in eighth grade  had a personality made up of tests and pills  lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs  four fifths suicidal  a tidal wave of antidepressants  and an adolescent being called  Popper   one part because of the pills     parts because of the cruelty. He tried to kill himself in grade    when a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad had the audacity to tell him   Get over it.  As if depression is something that could be remedied by any of the contents found in a first aid kit. To this day  he is a stick of TNT lit from both ends  could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends in the moment before it's about to fall  and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration  he remains a conversation piece between people who can't understand sometimes being drug free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity. We weren't the only kids who grew up this way. To this day  kids are still being called names. The classics were  Hey  stupid    Hey  spaz.  Seems like every school has an arsenal of names getting updated every year. And if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear  do they make a sound  Are they just background noise from a soundtrack stuck on repeat  when people say things like   Kids can be cruel.  Every school was a big top circus tent  and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers  from clowns to carnies  all of these miles ahead of who we were. We were freaks    lobster claw boys and bearded ladies  oddities juggling depression and loneliness  playing solitaire  spin the bottle  trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal  but at night  while the others slept  we kept walking the tightrope. It was practice  and yes  some of us fell. But I want to tell them that all of this is just debris left over when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be  and if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself  get a better mirror  look a little closer  stare a little longer  because there's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit. You built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself   They were wrong.  Because maybe you didn't belong to a group or a clique. Maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything. Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show and tell  but never told  because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it  You have to believe that they were wrong. They have to be wrong. Why else would we still be here  We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them. We stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called. We are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway  and if in some way we are  don't worry. We only got out to walk and get gas. We are graduating members from the class of We Made It  not the faded echoes of voices crying out   Names will never hurt me.  Of course they did. But our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act that has less to do with pain and more to do with beauty. I want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship. I happen to have triplets. They're little. They're five years old. Sometimes I tell people I have triplets. They say   Really  How many   Here's a picture of the kids    that's Sage  and Annalisa and Rider. Now  I also happen to be gay. Being gay and fathering triplets is by far the most socially innovative  socially entrepreneurial thing I have ever done. The real social innovation I want to talk about involves charity. I want to talk about how the things we've been taught to think about giving and about charity and about the nonprofit sector  are actually undermining the causes we love  and our profound yearning to change the world. But before I do that  I want to ask if we even believe that the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play in changing the world. A lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies  and social business will take care of the rest. And I do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward. But it always leaves behind that    percent or more that is most disadvantaged or unlucky. And social business needs markets  and there are some issues for which you just can't develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market. I sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled  and these people want laughter and compassion and they want love. How do you monetize that  And that's where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in. Philanthropy is the market for love. It is the market for all those people for whom there is no other market coming. And so if we really want  like Buckminster Fuller said  a world that works for everyone  with no one and nothing left out  then the nonprofit sector has to be a serious part of the conversation. But it doesn't seem to be working. Why have our breast cancer charities not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer  or our homeless charities not come close to ending homelessness in any major city  Why has poverty remained stuck at    percent of the U.S. population for    years  And the answer is  these social problems are massive in scale  our organizations are tiny up against them  and we have a belief system that keeps them tiny. We have two rulebooks. We have one for the nonprofit sector  and one for the rest of the economic world. It's an apartheid  and it discriminates against the nonprofit sector in five different areas  the first being compensation. So in the for profit sector  the more value you produce  the more money you can make. But we don't like nonprofits to use money to incentivize people to produce more in social service. We have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people. Interestingly  we don't have a visceral reaction to the notion that people would make a lot of money not helping other people. You know  you want to make    million dollars selling violent video games to kids  go for it. We'll put you on the cover of Wired magazine. But you want to make half a million dollars trying to cure kids of malaria  and you're considered a parasite yourself. And we think of this as our system of ethics  but what we don't realize is that this system has a powerful side effect  which is  It gives a really stark  mutually exclusive choice between doing very well for yourself and your family or doing good for the world  to the brightest minds coming out of our best universities  and sends tens of thousands of people who could make a huge difference in the nonprofit sector  marching every year directly into the for profit sector because they're not willing to make that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice. Businessweek did a survey  looked at the compensation packages for MBAs    years out of business school. And the median compensation for a Stanford MBA  with bonus  at the age of     was         dollars. Meanwhile  for the same year  the average salary for the CEO of a    million plus medical charity in the U.S. was         dollars  and for a hunger charity         dollars. Now  there's no way you're going to get a lot of people with          talent to make a          sacrifice every year to become the CEO of a hunger charity. Some people say   Well  that's just because those MBA types are greedy.  Not necessarily. They might be smart. It's cheaper for that person to donate         dollars every year to the hunger charity  save        dollars on their taxes    so still be roughly         dollars a year ahead of the game    now be called a philanthropist because they donated         dollars to charity  probably sit on the board of the hunger charity  indeed  probably supervise the poor SOB who decided to become the CEO of the hunger charity  and have a lifetime of this kind of power and influence and popular praise still ahead of them. The second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing. So we tell the for profit sector   Spend  spend  spend on advertising  until the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value.  But we don't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity. Our attitude is   Well  look  if you can get the advertising donated  you know  to air at four o'clock in the morning  I'm okay with that. But I don't want my donation spent on advertising  I want it go to the needy.  As if the money invested in advertising could not bring in dramatically greater sums of money to serve the needy. In the     s  my company created the long distance AIDSRide bicycle journeys  and the    mile long breast cancer three day walks  and over the course of nine years  we had         ordinary heroes participate  and they raised a total of     million dollars. They raised more money more quickly for these causes than any events in history  all based on the idea that people are weary of being asked to do the least they can possibly do. People are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential on behalf of the causes that they care about deeply. But they have to be asked. We got that many people to participate by buying full page ads in The New York Times  in The Boston Globe  in prime time radio and TV advertising. Do you know how many people we would've gotten if we put up fliers in the laundromat  Charitable giving has remained stuck in the U.S.  at two percent of GDP  ever since we started measuring it in the     s. That's an important fact  because it tells us that in    years  the nonprofit sector has not been able to wrestle any market share away from the for profit sector. And if you think about it  how could one sector possibly take market share away from another sector if it isn't really allowed to market  And if we tell the consumer brands   You may advertise all the benefits of your product   but we tell charities   You cannot advertise all the good that you do   where do we think the consumer dollars are going to flow  The third area of discrimination is the taking of risk in pursuit of new ideas for generating revenue. So Disney can make a new      million movie that flops  and nobody calls the attorney general. But you do a little    million community fundraiser for the poor  and it doesn't produce a    percent profit to the cause in the first    months  and your character is called into question. So nonprofits are really reluctant to attempt any brave  daring  giant scale new fundraising endeavors  for fear that if the thing fails  their reputations will be dragged through the mud. Well  you and I know when you prohibit failure  you kill innovation. If you kill innovation in fundraising  you can't raise more revenue  if you can't raise more revenue  you can't grow  and if you can't grow  you can't possibly solve large social problems. The fourth area is time. So Amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors  and people had patience. They knew that there was a long term objective down the line  of building market dominance. But if a nonprofit organization ever had a dream of building magnificent scale that required that for six years  no money was going to go to the needy  it was all going to be invested in building this scale  we would expect a crucifixion. The last area is profit itself. So the for profit sector can pay people profits in order to attract their capital for their new ideas  but you can't pay profits in a nonprofit sector  so the for profit sector has a lock on the multi trillion dollar capital markets  and the nonprofit sector is starved for growth and risk and idea capital. Well  you put those five things together    you can't use money to lure talent away from the for profit sector  you can't advertise on anywhere near the scale the for profit sector does for new customers  you can't take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers that the for profit sector takes  you don't have the same amount of time to find them as the for profit sector  and you don't have a stock market with which to fund any of this  even if you could do it in the first place    and you've just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for profit sector  on every level. If we have any doubts about the effects of this separate rule book  this statistic is sobering  From      to       the number of nonprofits that really grew  that crossed the     million annual revenue barrier  is    . In the same time  the number of for profits that crossed it is       . So we're dealing with social problems that are massive in scale  and our organizations can't generate any scale. All of the scale goes to Coca Cola and Burger King. So why do we think this way  Well  like most fanatical dogma in America  these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs. The Puritans came here for religious reasons  or so they said  but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money. They were pious people  but they were also really aggressive capitalists  and they were accused of extreme forms of profit making tendencies  compared to the other colonists. But at the same time  the Puritans were Calvinists  so they were taught literally to hate themselves. They were taught that self interest was a raging sea that was a sure path to eternal damnation. This created a real problem for these people. Here they've come all the way across the Atlantic to make all this money  but making all this money will get you sent directly to Hell. What were they to do about this  Well  charity became their answer. It became this economic sanctuary  where they could do penance for their profit making tendencies    at five cents on the dollar. So of course  how could you make money in charity if charity was your penance for making money  Financial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others  so that it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself  and in     years  nothing has intervened to say   That's counterproductive and that's unfair.  Now  this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question  which is   What percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead   There are a lot of problems with this question. I'm going to just focus on two. First  it makes us think that overhead is a negative  that it is somehow not part of the cause. But it absolutely is  especially if it's being used for growth. Now  this idea that overhead is somehow an enemy of the cause creates this second  much larger problem  which is  it forces organizations to go without the overhead things they really need to grow  in the interest of keeping overhead low. So we've all been taught that charities should spend as little as possible on overhead things like fundraising under the theory that  well  the less money you spend on fundraising  the more money there is available for the cause. Well  that's true if it's a depressing world in which this pie cannot be made any bigger. But if it's a logical world in which investment in fundraising actually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger  then we have it precisely backwards  and we should be investing more money  not less  in fundraising  because fundraising is the one thing that has the potential to multiply the amount of money available for the cause that we care about so deeply. I'll give you two examples. We launched the AIDSRides with an initial investment of        dollars in risk capital. Within nine years  we had multiplied that       times  into     million dollars after all expenses  for AIDS services. We launched the breast cancer three days with an initial investment of         dollars in risk capital. Within just five years  we had multiplied that     times  into     million dollars after all expenses  for breast cancer research. Now  if you were a philanthropist really interested in breast cancer  what would make more sense  go out and find the most innovative researcher in the world and give her         dollars for research  or give her fundraising department the         dollars to multiply it into     million dollars for breast cancer research       was our most successful year ever. We netted for breast cancer alone  that year alone     million dollars after all expenses. And then we went out of business  suddenly and traumatically. Why  Well  the short story is  our sponsors split on us. They wanted to distance themselves from us because we were being crucified in the media for investing    percent of the gross in recruitment and customer service and the magic of the experience  and there is no accounting terminology to describe that kind of investment in growth and in the future  other than this demonic label of  overhead.  So on one day  all     of our great employees lost their jobs ... because they were labeled  overhead.  Our sponsor went and tried the events on their own. The overhead went up. Net income for breast cancer research went down by    percent  or    million dollars  in one year. This is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality. We've all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead is morally superior to the professional fundraising enterprise with    percent overhead  but we're missing the most important piece of information  which is  What is the actual size of these pies  Who cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it's tiny  What if the bake sale only netted    dollars for charity because it made no investment in its scale and the professional fundraising enterprise netted    million dollars because it did  Now which pie would we prefer  and which pie do we think people who are hungry would prefer  Here's how all of this impacts the big picture. I said that charitable giving is two percent of GDP in the United States. That's about     billion dollars a year. But only about    percent of that  or    billion dollars  goes to health and human services causes. The rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals  and that    billion dollars is not nearly enough to tackle these problems. But if we could move charitable giving from two percent of GDP  up just one step to three percent of GDP  by investing in that growth  that would be an extra     billion dollars a year in contributions  and if that money could go disproportionately to health and human services charities  because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth  that would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector. Now we're talking scale. Now we're talking the potential for real change. But it's never going to happen by forcing these organizations to lower their horizons to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low. Our generation does not want its epitaph to read   We kept charity overhead low.  We want it to read that we changed the world  and that part of the way we did that was by changing the way we think about these things. So the next time you're looking at a charity  don't ask about the rate of their overhead. Ask about the scale of their dreams  their Apple   Google   Amazon scale dreams  how they measure their progress toward those dreams  and what resources they need to make them come true  regardless of what the overhead is. Who cares what the overhead is if these problems are actually getting solved  If we can have that kind of generosity    a generosity of thought    then the non profit sector can play a massive role in changing the world for all those citizens most desperately in need of it to change. And if that can be our generation's enduring legacy    that we took responsibility for the thinking that had been handed down to us  that we revisited it  we revised it  and we reinvented the whole way humanity thinks about changing things  forever  for everyone    well  I thought I would let the kids sum up what that would be. Annalisa Smith Pallotta  That would be Sage Smith Pallotta  a real social Rider Smith Pallotta  innovation. Dan Pallotta  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. So raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness. Yeah. I thought so. Not surprised. And raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness in humans. Yeah. I thought so. I'm also not surprised. I can see I've got my work cut out for me here. As we heard from Dr. Insel this morning  psychiatric disorders like autism  depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering. We know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body. Think about it  In       the second decade of the millennium  if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor  you get bone scans  biopsies and blood tests. In       if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis  you go to your doctor  and what do you get  A questionnaire. Now  part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders. We tend to view them    and the popular press aids and abets this view    as chemical imbalances in the brain  as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine  serotonin and norepinephrine. This view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders  like Prozac  act by globally changing brain chemistry  as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup. But that can't be the answer  because these drugs actually don't work all that well. A lot of people won't take them  or stop taking them  because of their unpleasant side effects. These drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block. Some of it will dribble into the right place  but a lot of it will do more harm than good. Now  an emerging view that you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning  is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion  mood and affect. When we think about cognition  we analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem. Well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion. It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way. But we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis. Now  it's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders. It's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup. Rather  they're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain. So if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders  we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act. Otherwise  we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences. Now to begin to overcome our ignorance of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry  it's helpful to work on what we biologists call  model organisms   animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice  in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecularly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons  as you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning. Moreover  once we can do that  we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons. So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron  and we find that a behavior is blocked  we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior. On the other hand  if we activate a group of neurons and we find that that produces the behavior  we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior. So in this way  by doing this kind of test  we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors  something that is extremely difficult  if not impossible  to do right now in humans. But can an organism like a fruit fly  which is    it's a great model organism because it's got a small brain  it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors  it breeds quickly  and it's cheap. But can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion like states  Do these organisms even have emotion like states  or are they just little digital robots  Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors  as he wrote in his      monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals. And my eponymous colleague  Seymour Benzer  believed it as well. Seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila here at CalTech in the '  s as a model organism to study the connection between genes and behavior. Seymour recruited me to CalTech in the late     s. He was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here  and Seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science. So how do we ask this question  It's one thing to believe that flies have emotion like states  but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not  Now  in humans we often infer emotional states  as you'll hear later today  from facial expressions. However  it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies. It's kind of like landing on Mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out   How do I find out if they have emotions or not   What can we do  It's not so easy. Well  one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion like states such as arousal  and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties. So three important ones that I can think of are persistence  gradations in intensity  and valence. Persistence means long lasting. We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone. Gradations of intensity means what it sounds like. You can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion. If you're a little bit unhappy  the corners of your mouth turn down and you sniffle  and if you're very unhappy  tears pour down your face and you might sob. Valence means good or bad  positive or negative. So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table  you know  the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away  and it seems to keep getting irritated. So we built a device  which we call a puff o mat  in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away. And what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puff o mat several puffs in a row  they became somewhat hyperactive and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to calm down. So we quantified this behavior using custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona  who's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech. And what this quantification showed us is that  upon experiencing a train of these air puffs  the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent  long lasting  and also appears to be graded. More puffs  or more intense puffs  make the state last for a longer period of time. So now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state. So we decided to use our puff o mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs. And this is one of the great things about fruit flies. There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation. So doing the screen  we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs  and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation  it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor. That's right    flies  like people  have dopamine  and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have. Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain  including in attention  arousal  reward  and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse  Parkinson's disease  and ADHD. Now  in genetics  it's a little counterintuitive. We tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn't happen when we take it away  by the opposite of what we see when we take it away. So when we take away the dopamine receptor and the flies take longer to calm down  from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff. And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD  which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans. Indeed  if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license   oh my God     Laughter    we find indeed that these cocaine fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do  and that's also reminiscent of ADHD  which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin that act similarly to cocaine. So slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder. Now  how far does this analogy go  As many of you know  individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities. Is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies  Remarkably  the answer is yes. As Seymour showed back in the     s  flies  like songbirds  as you just heard  are capable of learning. You can train a fly to avoid an odor  shown here in blue  if you pair that odor with a shock. Then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the shock paired odor and another odor  it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock. Well  if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies  they don't learn. Their learning score is zero. They flunk out of CalTech. So that means that these flies have two abnormalities  or phenotypes  as we geneticists call them  that one finds in ADHD  hyperactivity and learning disability. Now what's the causal relationship  if anything  between these phenotypes  In ADHD  it's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability. The kids can't sit still long enough to focus  so they don't learn. But it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities that cause the hyperactivity. Because the kids can't learn  they look for other things to distract their attention. And a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity  but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD. Now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans  but in flies we can actually test this. And the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics. We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore  or cure  the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain. But in each fly  we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others  and then we test each of these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity. Remarkably  we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities. If we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex  the flies are no longer hyperactive  but they still can't learn. On the other hand  if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body  the learning deficit is rescued  the flies learn well  but they're still hyperactive. What that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup. Rather  it's acting to control two different functions on two different circuits  so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain. Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans we don't know  but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility. So these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup  and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup. What we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders. If we can do that  we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects  putting the oil back in our mental engines  just where it's needed. Thank you very much. Now  extinction is a different kind of death. It's bigger. We didn't really realize that until       when the last passenger pigeon  a female named Martha  died at the Cincinnati zoo. This had been the most abundant bird in the world that'd been in North America for six million years. Suddenly it wasn't here at all. Flocks that were a mile wide and     miles long used to darken the sun. Aldo Leopold said this was a biological storm  a feathered tempest. And indeed it was a keystone species that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest  from the Mississippi to the Atlantic  from Canada down to the Gulf. But it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades. What happened  Well  commercial hunting happened. These birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton  and it was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground  they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up and slaughter them by the tens of thousands. It was the cheapest source of protein in America. By the end of the century  there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers. There's an upside to the story. This made people realize that the same thing was about to happen to the American bison  and so these birds saved the buffalos. But a lot of other animals weren't saved. The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere. It was hunted to death for its feathers. There was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen. It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway. A local newspaper spelled out   There is no survivor  there is no future  there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again.  There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things  and it happened to lots of birds that people loved. It happened to lots of mammals. Another keystone species is a famous animal called the European aurochs. There was sort of a movie made about it recently. And the aurochs was like the bison. This was an animal that basically kept the forest mixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent  from Spain to Korea. The documentation of this animal goes back to the Lascaux cave paintings. The extinctions still go on. There's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo. It went extinct in     . There was a marvelous animal  a marsupial wolf called the thylacine in Tasmania  south of Australia  called the Tasmanian tiger. It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos. A little bit of film was shot. Sorrow  anger  mourning. Don't mourn. Organize. What if you could find out that  using the DNA in museum specimens  fossils maybe up to         years old could be used to bring species back  what would you do  Where would you start  Well  you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there. I started with my wife  Ryan Phelan  who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct  and through her  one of her colleagues  George Church  one of the leading genetic engineers who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons and a lot of confidence that methodologies he was working on might actually do the deed. So he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting at the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together specialists on passenger pigeons  conservation ornithologists  bioethicists  and fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro. All she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue  because down in there is what is called ancient DNA. It's DNA which is pretty badly fragmented  but with good techniques now  you can basically reassemble the whole genome. Then the question is  can you reassemble  with that genome  the whole bird  George Church thinks you can. So in his book   Regenesis   which I recommend  he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species  and he has a machine called the Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine. It's kind of like an evolution machine. You try combinations of genes that you write at the cell level and then in organs on a chip  and the ones that win  that you can then put into a living organism. It'll work. The precision of this  one of George's famous unreadable slides  nevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair. The passenger pigeon has  .  billion base pairs in its genome. So what you're getting is the capability now of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene. It's called an allele. Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway. So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome of an extinct species with the genome of its closest living relative. Now along the way  George points out that his technology  the technology of synthetic biology  is currently accelerating at four times the rate of Moore's Law. It's been doing that since       and it's likely to continue. Okay  the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon is the band tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here. Genetically  the band tailed pigeon already is mostly living passenger pigeon. There's just some bits that are band tailed pigeon. If you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits  you've got the extinct bird back  cooing at you. Now  there's work to do. You have to figure out exactly what genes matter. So there's genes for the short tail in the band tailed pigeon  genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon  and so on with the red eye  peach colored breast  flocking  and so on. Add them all up and the result won't be perfect. But it should be be perfect enough  because nature doesn't do perfect either. So this meeting in Boston led to three things. First off  Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit called Revive and Restore that would push de extinction generally and try to have it go in a responsible way  and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon. Another direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak  who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was    and had also learned how to work with ancient DNA  himself sequenced the passenger pigeon  using money from his family and friends. We hired him full time. Now  this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian  he's looking down at Martha  the last passenger pigeon alive. So if he's successful  she won't be the last. The third result of the Boston meeting was the realization that there are scientists all over the world working on various forms of de extinction  but they'd never met each other. And National Geographic got interested because National Geographic has the theory that the last century  discovery was basically finding things  and in this century  discovery is basically making things. De extinction falls in that category. So they hosted and funded this meeting. And    scientists  they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists  basically meeting to see if they had work to do together. Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical. There's three of them who are not just re creating ancient species  they're recreating extinct ecosystems in northern Siberia  in the Netherlands  and in Hawaii. Henri  from the Netherlands  with a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce  is working on the aurochs. The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle  and so basically its genome is alive  it's just unevenly distributed. So what they're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive  hardy looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there to rebuild  over time  with selective back breeding  the aurochs. Now  re wilding is moving faster in Korea than it is in America  and so the plan is  with these re wilded areas all over Europe  they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job  its old ecological role  of clearing the somewhat barren  closed canopy forest so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it. Another amazing story came from Alberto Fern ndez Arias. Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain. The last bucardo was a female named Celia who was still alive  but then they captured her  they got a little bit of tissue from her ear  they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen  released her back into the wild  but a few months later  she was found dead under a fallen tree. They took the DNA from that ear  they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat  the pregnancy came to term  and a live baby bucardo was born. It was the first de extinction in history. It was short lived. Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems. This one had a malformed lung and died after    minutes  but Alberto was confident that cloning has moved along well since then  and this will move ahead  and eventually there will be a population of bucardos back in the mountains in northern Spain. Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder. At the San Diego zoo  his frozen zoo has collected the tissues from over       species over the last    years. Now  when it's frozen that deep  minus     degrees Celsius  the cells are intact and the DNA is intact. They're basically viable cells  so someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology took some of that tissue from an endangered animal called the Javan banteng  put it in a cow  the cow went to term  and what was born was a live  healthy baby Javan banteng  who thrived and is still alive. The most exciting thing for Bob Lanza is the ability now to take any kind of cell with induced pluripotent stem cells and turn it into germ cells  like sperm and eggs. So now we go to Mike McGrew who is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland  and Mike's doing miracles with birds. So he'll take  say  falcon skin cells  fibroblast  turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells. Since it's so pluripotent  it can become germ plasm. He then has a way to put the germ plasm into the embryo of a chicken egg so that that chicken will have  basically  the gonads of a falcon. You get a male and a female each of those  and out of them comes falcons. Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens. Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting. He showed how all of this can be put together. The sequence of events  he'll put together the genomes of the band tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon  he'll take the techniques of George Church and get passenger pigeon DNA  the techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew  get that DNA into chicken gonads  and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs  squabs  and now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons. It does raise the question of  they're not going to have passenger pigeon parents to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon. So what do you do about that  Well birds are pretty hard wired  as it happens  so most of that is already in their DNA  but to supplement it  part of Ben's idea is to use homing pigeons to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds and feeding grounds. There were some conservationists  really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple  who is one of the founders of conservation biology  and Kate Jones from the IUCN  which does the Red List. They're excited about all this  but they're also concerned that it might be competitive with the extremely important efforts to protect endangered species that are still alive  that haven't gone extinct yet. You see  you want to work on protecting the animals out there. You want to work on getting the market for ivory in Asia down so you're not using        elephants a year. But at the same time  conservation biologists are realizing that bad news bums people out. And so the Red List is really important  keep track of what's endangered and critically endangered  and so on. But they're about to create what they call a Green List  and the Green List will have species that are doing fine  thank you  species that were endangered  like the bald eagle  but they're much better off now  thanks to everybody's good work  and protected areas around the world that are very  very well managed. So basically  they're learning how to build on good news. And they see reviving extinct species as the kind of good news you might be able to build on. Here's a couple related examples. Captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species. The California condor was down to    birds in     . Everybody thought is was finished. Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo  there's     of them now      are out in the wild. That technology will be used on de extincted animals. Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa. In       Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct. There were just     left. Now there are    . They're increasing in population by three percent a year. The secret is  they have an eco tourism program  which is absolutely brilliant. So this photograph was taken last month by Ryan with an iPhone. That's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors. Another interesting project  though it's going to need some help  is the northern white rhinoceros. There's no breeding pairs left. But this is the kind of thing that a wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo. A bit of cloning  you can get them back. So where do we go from here  These have been private meetings so far. I think it's time for the subject to go public. What do people think about it  You know  do you want extinct species back  Do you want extinct species back  Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down. It is a Tinker Bell moment  because what are people excited about with this  What are they concerned about  We're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon. So Ben Novak  even as we speak  is joining the group that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz. They're going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the band tailed pigeon. As that data matures  they'll send it to George Church  who will work his magic  get passenger pigeon DNA out of that. We'll get help from Bob Lanza and Mike McGrew to get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens that can produce passenger pigeon squabs that can be raised by band tailed pigeon parents  and then from then on  it's passenger pigeons all the way  maybe for the next six million years. You can do the same thing  as the costs come down  for the Carolina parakeet  for the great auk  for the heath hen  for the ivory billed woodpecker  for the Eskimo curlew  for the Caribbean monk seal  for the woolly mammoth. Because the fact is  humans have made a huge hole in nature in the last        years. We have the ability now  and maybe the moral obligation  to repair some of the damage. Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands  by expanding and protecting the populations of endangered species. But some species that we killed off totally we could consider bringing back to a world that misses them. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I've got a question. So  this is an emotional topic. Some people stand. I suspect there are some people out there sitting  kind of asking tormented questions  almost  about  well  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait a minute  there's something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way. There's going to be unintended consequences. You're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box of who knows what. Do they have a point  Stewart Brand  Well  the earlier point is we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct  and many of them were keystone species  and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in by letting them go. Now  there's the shifting baseline problem  which is  so when these things come back  they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love. I think that's  you know  part of how it'll work. This is a long  slow process    One of the things I like about it  it's multi generation. We will get woolly mammoths back. CA  Well it feels like both the conversation and the potential here are pretty thrilling. Thank you so much for presenting. SB  Thank you. CA  Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last    years of anti poverty campaigning into    minutes for TED. That's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct. I said   Chris  that would take a miracle.  He said   Bono  wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex   So  yeah. Then I thought  let's go even further than    years. Let's go back before Christ  three millennia  to a time when  at least in my head  the journey for justice  the march against inequality and poverty really began. Three thousand years ago  civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile  some slaves  Jewish shepherds in this instance  smelling of sheep shit  I guess  proclaimed to the Pharaoh  sitting high on his throne   We  your majesty ness  are equal to you.  And the Pharaoh replies   Oh  no. You  your miserableness  have got to be kidding.  And they say   No  no  that's what it says here in our holy book.  Cut to our century  same country  same pyramids  another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book. This time it's called the Facebook. Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square. They turn a social network from virtual to actual  and kind of rebooted the   st century. Not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the Arab Spring has been  neither to oversell the role of technology  but these things have given a sense of what's possible when the age old model of power  the pyramid  gets turned upside down  putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom  as it were. It's also shown us that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality  because facts  like people  want to be free  and when they're free  liberty is usually around the corner  even for the poorest of the poor    facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy that leads to inertia  facts that tell us what's working and  more importantly  what's not  so we can fix it  facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made back in       when he asked us to be that great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity  extreme poverty  facts that build a powerful momentum. So I thought  forget the rock opera  forget the bombast  my usual tricks. The only thing singing today would be the facts  for I have truly embraced by inner nerd. So exit the rock star. Enter the evidence based activist  the factivist. Because what the facts are telling us is that the long  slow journey  humanity's long  slow journey of equality  is actually speeding up. Look at what's been achieved. Look at the pictures these data sets print. Since the year       since the turn of the millennium  there are eight million more AIDS patients getting life saving antiretroviral drugs. Malaria  There are eight countries in sub Saharan Africa that have their death rates cut by    percent. For kids under five  child mortality  kids under five  it's down by  .   million a year. That's a rate of       children's lives saved each day. Wow. Wow.  Applause  Let's just stop for a second  actually  and think about that. Have you read anything anywhere in the last week that is remotely as important as that number  Wow. Great news. It drives me nuts that most people don't seem to know this news. Seven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them. This is Michael and Benedicta  and they're alive thanks in large part to Dr. Patricia Asamoah    she's amazing    and the Global Fund  which all of you financially support  whether you know it or not. And the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs that stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids. This fantastic news didn't happen by itself. It was fought for  it was campaigned for  it was innovated for. And this great news gives birth to even more great news  because the historic trend is this. The number of people living in back breaking  soul crushing extreme poverty has declined from    percent of the world's population in      to    percent by      and then to    percent by     . Give it up for that.  Applause  Halved. Halved. Now  the rate is still too high    still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives. There's still work to do. But it's heart stopping. It's mind blowing stuff. And if you live on less than   .   a day  if you live in that kind of poverty  this is not just data. This is everything. If you're a parent who wants the best for your kids    and I am    this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope. And guess what  If the trajectory continues  look where the amount of people living on   .   a day gets to by     . Can't be true  can it  That's what the data is telling us. If the trajectory continues  we get to  wow  the zero zone. For number crunchers like us  that is the erogenous zone  and it's fair to say that I am  by now  sexually aroused by the collating of data. So virtual elimination of extreme poverty  as defined by people living on less than   .   a day  adjusted  of course  for inflation from a      baseline. We do love a good baseline. That's amazing. Now I know that some of you think this progress is all in Asia or Latin America or model countries like Brazil    and who doesn't love a Brazilian model     but look at sub Saharan Africa. There's a collection of    countries  some call them the lions  who in the last decade have had a combination of     percent debt cancellation  a tripling of aid  a tenfold increase in FDI    that's foreign direct investment    which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources    that's local money    which  when spent wisely    that's good governance    cut childhood mortality by a third  doubled education completion rates  and they  too  halved extreme poverty  and at this rate  these    get to zero too. So the pride of lions is the proof of concept. There are all kinds of benefits to this. For a start  you won't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped up Jesus like myself. How about that   Applause  And             It's just around the corner. I mean  it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away. Makes us look really young. So why aren't we jumping up and down about this  Well  the opportunity is real  but so is the jeopardy. We can't get this done until we really accept that we can get this done. Look at this graph. It's called inertia. It's how we screw it up. And the next one is really beautiful. It's called momentum. And it's how we can bend the arc of history down towards zero  just doing the things that we know work. So inertia versus momentum. There is jeopardy  and of course  the closer you get  it gets harder. We know the obstacles that are in our way right now  in difficult times. In fact  today in your capital  in difficult times  some who mind the nation's purse want to cut life saving programs like the Global Fund. But you can do something about that. You can tell politicians that these cuts  can cost  lives. Right now today  in Oslo as it happens  oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing countries. You can do something about that too. You can join the One Campaign  and leaders like Mo Ibrahim  the telecom entrepreneur. We're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it. And right now  we know that the biggest disease of all is not a disease. It's corruption. But there's a vaccine for that too. It's called transparency  open data sets  something the TED community is really on it. Daylight  you could call it  transparency. And technology is really turbocharging this. It's getting harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff. So let me tell you about the U report  which I'm really excited about. It's         millennials all across Uganda  young people armed with  G phones  an SMS social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what's in the budget and how their money is being spent. This is exciting stuff. Look  once you have these tools  you can't not use them. Once you have this knowledge  you can't un know it. You can't delete this data from your brain  but you can delete the cliched image of supplicant  impoverished peoples not taking control of their own lives. You can erase that  you really can  because it's not true anymore.  Applause  It's transformational.       By       robots  not just serving us Guinness  but drinking it. By the time we get there  every place with a rough semblance of governance might actually be on their way. So I'm here to    I guess we're here to try and infect you with this virtuous  data based virus  the one we call factivism. It's not going to kill you. In fact  it could save countless lives. I guess we in the One Campaign would love you to be contagious  spread it  share it  pass it on. By doing so  you will join us and countless others in what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken  the ever demanding journey of equality. Could we really be the great generation that Mandela asked us to be  Might we answer that clarion call with science  with reason  with facts  and  dare I say it  emotions  Because as is obvious  factivists have feelings too. I'm thinking of Wael Ghonim  though. Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo. He got thrown in jail for it  but I have his words tattooed on my brain.  We are going to win because we don't understand politics. We are going to win because we don't play their dirty games. We are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda. We are going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. We are going to win because we have dreams  and we're willing to stand up for those dreams.  Wael is right. We're going to win if we work together as one  because the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power. Thank you. Thank you so much.  Applause  I have a friend in Portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family. He did it because he couldn't afford a car  but also because he knew how to build one. There was a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made  so we could build and repair them  or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy. Many of these do it yourself practices were lost in the second half of the   th century. But now  the maker community and the open source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work and what they're made of back into our lives  and I believe we need to take them to the next level  to the components things are made of. For the most part  we still know what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of and how they are produced. But now we have these amazing  futuristic composites    plastics that change shape  paints that conduct electricity  pigments that change color  fabrics that light up. Let me show you some examples. So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires. In the case of this little example I'm holding  we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light. Conductive ink has been used by artists  but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens. And this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light diffusing particles. What this means is that  while regular acrylic only diffuses light around the edges  this one illuminates across the entire surface when I turn on the lights around it. Two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi touch systems. And thermochromic pigments change color at a given temperature. So I'm going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient and you can see what happens. So one of the principle applications for this material is  amongst other things  in baby bottles  so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink. So these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials. In a few years  they will be in many of the objects and technologies we use on a daily basis. We may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us  but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature  keyboards that roll up  and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch. So I'm a social scientist by training  so why am I here today talking about smart materials  Well first of all  because I am a maker. I'm curious about how things work and how they are made  but also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world  and right now  we don't know enough about these high tech composites our future will be made of. Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities. There's barely any information available on how to use them  and very little is said about how they are produced. So for now  they exist mostly in this realm of trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to. So a little over three years ago  Kirsty Boyle and I started a project we called Open Materials. It's a website where we  and anyone else who wants to join us  share experiments  publish information  encourage others to contribute whenever they can  and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves. We would like it to become a large  collectively generated database of do it yourself information on smart materials. But why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of  First of all  because we can't shape what we don't understand  and what we don't understand and use ends up shaping us. The objects we use  the clothes we wear  the houses we live in  all have a profound impact on our behavior  health and quality of life. So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials  we should know and understand them. Secondly  and just as important  innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers. So many times  amateurs  not experts  have been the inventors and improvers of things ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors  personal computers  airplanes. The biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment. But that's not always the case. Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink. Jordan Bunker  who had had no experience with chemistry until then  read this paper and reproduced the experiment at his maker space using only off the shelf substances and tools. He used a toaster oven  and he even made his own vortex mixer  based on a tutorial by another scientist maker. Jordan then published his results online  including all the things he had tried and didn't work  so others could study and reproduce it. So Jordan's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well equipped lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in Chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself. And now that he published this work  others can pick up where he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements. Another example I'd like to mention is Hannah Perner Wilson's Kit of No Parts. Her project's goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder. Electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work  but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn. So Hannah's approach  on the other hand  is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that free us from pre designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves. So amongst Hannah's many impressive experiments  this is one of my favorites.   Paper speakers   What we're seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp  player and a magnet. So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT  Hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink. Just like Jordan and so many other makers  Hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them. But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics. So Hannah's artisanal work  and the fact that she shared her findings  opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative. So the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity  and we are not afraid to fail. We often tackle problems from unconventional angles  and  in the process  end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things. So the more people experiment with materials  the more researchers are willing to share their research  and manufacturers their knowledge  the better chances we have to create technologies that truly serve us all. So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have when  in the early     s  he wrote   You must understand computers now.  Back then  computers were these large mainframes only scientists cared about  and no one dreamed of even having one at home. So it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying   You must understand smart materials now.  Just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge about emerging technologies is the best way to ensure that we have a say in the making of our future. Thank you. So  this book that I have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in     .  Laughter  Actually  it's deceptively large. There's actually only about    people on each page  because we have the name  address and telephone number of every single person. And  in fact  everybody's listed twice  because it's sorted once by name and once by email address. Obviously a very small community. There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then. I knew them both. We didn't all know each other  but we all kind of trusted each other  and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network  and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things. So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community  let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days. Now  it just so happened that I got to register the third domain name on the Internet. So I could have anything I wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com. So I picked think.com  but then I thought  you know  there's a lot of really interesting names out there. Maybe I should register a few extras just in case. And then I thought   Nah  that wouldn't be very nice.  That attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days  and in fact  it wasn't just the people on the network  but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the Internet itself. So the basic idea of I.P.  or Internet protocol  and the way that the    the routing algorithm that used it  were fundamentally  from each according to their ability  to each according to their need.  And so  if you had some extra bandwidth  you'd deliver a message for someone. If they had some extra bandwidth  they would deliver a message for you. You'd kind of depend on people to do that  and that was the building block. It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department  but it obviously worked really well  and we all saw what happened with the Internet. It was incredibly successful. In fact  it was so successful that there's no way that these days you could make a book like this. My rough calculation is it would be about    miles thick. But  of course  you couldn't do it  because we don't know the names of all the people with Internet or email addresses  and even if we did know their names  I'm pretty sure that they would not want their name  address and telephone number published to everyone. So the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days  and so we dealt with that by making walled communities  secure subnetworks  VPNs  little things that aren't really the Internet but are made out of the same building blocks  but we're still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust. And that means that it's vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen  or certain kinds of deliberate attacks  but even the mistakes can be bad. So  for instance  in all of Asia recently  it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while because Pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network. They didn't intend to screw up Asia  but they did because of the way that the protocols work. Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is  you may remember a couple of years ago  all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in Salt Lake City had a bug in it. Now  you don't really think that our airplane system depends on the Internet  and in some sense it doesn't. I'll come back to that later. But the fact is that people couldn't take off because something was going wrong on the Internet  and the router card was down. And so  there are many of those things that start to happen. Now  there was an interesting thing that happened last April. All of a sudden  a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet  including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations  started getting re routed through China. So for a few hours  it all passed through China. Now  China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake  and it is actually possible that it was  the way things work  but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to  and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes. Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks. So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States or Western civilization these days  they're not going to do it with tanks. That will not succeed. What they'll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the Iranian nuclear facility. Nobody has claimed credit for that. There was basically a factory of industrial machines. It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet. It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet  but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a USB drive in there  or something like that  and software got in there that causes the centrifuges  in that case  to actually destroy themselves. Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant. And so there's a lot of    I'm sure you've read a lot in papers  about worries about cyberattacks and defenses against those. But the fact is  people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the Internet  and there's been surprisingly little attention to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium. And I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that  because it's actually kind of fragile. So actually  in the early days  back when it was the ARPANET  there were actually times    there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it. And the way the Internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places  and this one processor  because of a broken card  decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time. So  in other words  it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it. So of course  the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy  who would send it back in time and get it there super early  so every message in the Internet started getting switched through this one node  and of course that clogged everything up. Everything started breaking. The interesting thing was  though  that the sysadmins were able to fix it  but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off. Now  of course you couldn't do that today. I mean  everything off  it's like the service call you get from the cable company  except for the whole world. Now  in fact  they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today. One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on that go through the Internet right now  and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it for more and more different things  like when you take off from LAX  you're really not thinking you're using the Internet. When you pump gas  you really don't think you're using the Internet. What's happening increasingly  though  is these systems are beginning to use the Internet. Most of them aren't based on the Internet yet  but they're starting to use the Internet for service functions  for administrative functions  and so if you take something like the cell phone system  which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part  Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions  and it's so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well  they're cheap  they're repeated  and so on. So all of our systems  more and more  are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology. And so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses Internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other. That's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that. So we've built this system where we understand all the parts of it  but we're using it in a very  very different way than we expected to use it  and it's gotten a very  very different scale than it was designed for. And in fact  nobody really exactly understands all the things it's being used for right now. It's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system  where we've designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have. And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet and saying it can do this  or it does do this  or it will do that  you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather  or something like that. They have an informed opinion  but it's changing so quickly that even the experts don't know exactly what's going on. So if you see one of these maps of the Internet  it's just somebody's guess. Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now because it's different than it was an hour ago. It's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring. And the problem with it is  I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system  where we take a system that's basically built on trust  was basically built for a smaller scale system  and we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate. And so right now  I think it's literally true that we don't know what the consequences of an effective denial of service attack on the Internet would be  and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year  and worse next year  and so on. But so what we need is a plan B. There is no plan B right now. There's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept to be independent of the Internet  made out of completely different sets of building blocks. So what we need is something that doesn't necessarily have to have the performance of the Internet  but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the Internet  or the hospitals have to order fuel oil. This doesn't need to be a multi billion dollar government project. It's actually relatively simple to do  technically  because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground  existing wireless infrastructure. It's basically a matter of deciding to do it. But people won't decide to do it until they recognize the need for it  and that's the problem that we have right now. So there's been plenty of people  plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years  but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B when plan A seems to be working so well. So I think that  if people understand how much we're starting to depend on the Internet  and how vulnerable it is  we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist  and I think if enough people say   Yeah  I would like to use it  I'd like to have such a system   then it will get built. It's not that hard a problem. It could definitely be done by people in this room. And so I think that this is actually  of all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference  this is probably one of the very easiest to fix. So I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Elon  what kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all electric car  Elon Musk  Well  it goes back to when I was in university. I thought about  what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity  I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production. That sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century  independent of environmental concerns. In fact  even if producing CO  was good for the environment  given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons  we need to find some sustainable means of operating. CA  Most of American electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help  EM  Right. There's two elements to that answer. One is that  even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars  you're still better off. So if you take  say  natural gas  which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel  if you burn that in a modern General Electric natural gas turbine  you'll get about    percent efficiency. If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car  you get about    percent efficiency. And the reason is  in the stationary power plant  you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more  is voluminous  and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source. So in effect  even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything  even using the same source fuel  you're at least twice as better off charging an electric car  then burning it at the power plant. CA  That scale delivers efficiency. EM  Yes  it does. And then the other point is  we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway  electricity generation. So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation  then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport. CA  So we've got some video here of the Tesla being assembled  which  if we could play that first video    So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle  EM  Sure. So  in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport  and I should say that I think  actually  all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets. There's just no way around Newton's third law. The question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport  And in order to do that for cars  you have to come up with a really energy efficient car  so that means making it incredibly light  and so what you're seeing here is the only all aluminum body and chassis car made in North America. In fact  we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack. And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size. So as a result  the energy usage is very low  and it has the most advanced battery pack  and that's what gives it the range that's competitive  so you can actually have on the order of a     mile range. CA  I mean  those battery packs are incredibly heavy  but you think the math can still work out intelligently    by combining light body  heavy battery  you can still gain spectacular efficiency. EM  Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack  and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range. And in fact  customers of the Model S are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range. I think somebody recently got     miles out of a single charge. CA  Bruno Bowden  who's here  did that  broke the world record.EM  Congratulations. CA  That was the good news. The bad news was that to do it  he had to drive at    miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops.  Laughter  EM  I mean  you can certainly drive    if you drive it    miles an hour  under normal conditions      miles is a reasonable number. CA  Let's show that second video showing the Tesla in action on ice. Not at all a dig at The New York Times  this  by the way. What is the most surprising thing about the experience of driving the car  EM  In creating an electric car  the responsiveness of the car is really incredible. So we wanted really to have people feel as though they've almost got to mind meld with the car  so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one  and as you corner and accelerate  it just happens  like the car has ESP. You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness. You can't do that with a gasoline car. I think that's really a profound difference  and people only experience that when they have a test drive. CA  I mean  this is a beautiful but expensive car. Is there a road map where this becomes a mass market vehicle  EM  Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been to have a sort of three step process  where version one was an expensive car at low volume  version two is medium priced and medium volume  and then version three would be low price  high volume. So we're at step two at this point. So we had a          sports car  which was the Roadster. Then we've got the Model S  which starts at around        dollars. And our third generation car  which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a         car. But whenever you've got really new technology  it generally takes about three major versions in order to make it a compelling mass market product. And so I think we're making progress in that direction  and I feel confident that we'll get there. CA  I mean  right now  if you've got a short commute  you can drive  you can get back  you can charge it at home. There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast. Do you see that coming  really  truly  or just on a few key routes  EM  There actually are far more charging stations than people realize  and at Tesla we developed something called a Supercharging technology  and we're offering that if you buy a Model S for free  forever. And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize. We actually have California and Nevada covered  and we've got the Eastern seaboard from Boston to D.C. covered. By the end of this year  you'll be able to drive from L.A. to New York just using the Supercharger network  which charges at five times the rate of anything else. And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop  to stop time  of about six or seven. So if you drive for three hours  you want to stop for    or    minutes  because that's normally what people will stop for. So if you start a trip at   a.m.  by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat  hit the restroom  coffee  and keep going. CA  So your proposition to consumers is  for the full charge  it could take an hour. So it's common    don't expect to be out of here in    minutes. Wait for an hour  but the good news is  you're helping save the planet  and by the way  the electricity is free. You don't pay anything. EM  Actually  what we're expecting is for people to stop for about    to    minutes  not for an hour. It's actually better to drive for about maybe          miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going. That's the natural cadence of a trip. CA  All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow. You've been working on this solar company SolarCity. What's unusual about that  EM  Well  as I mentioned earlier  we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption  so I'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar. I mean  it's really indirect fusion  is what it is. We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun  and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization. What most people know but don't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar powered already. If the sun wasn't there  we'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees Kelvin  and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation. The whole ecosystem is solar powered. CA  But in a gallon of gasoline  you have  effectively  thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space  so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar  and to remotely compete with  for example  natural gas  fracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here  EM  Well actually  I'm confident that solar will beat everything  hands down  including natural gas. EM  It must  actually. If it doesn't  we're in deep trouble. CA  But you're not selling solar panels to consumers. What are you doing  EM  No  we actually are. You can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system. Most people choose to lease. And the thing about solar power is that it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs  so once it's installed  it's just there. It works for decades. It'll work for probably a century. So therefore  the key thing to do is to get the cost of that initial installation low  and then get the cost of the financing low  because that interest    those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar. And we've made huge progress in that direction  and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas. CA  So your current proposition to consumers is  don't pay so much up front. EM  Zero.CA  Pay zero up front. We will install panels on your roof. You will then pay  how long is a typical lease  EM  Typical leases are    years  but the value proposition is  as you're sort of alluding to  quite straightforward. It's no money down  and your utility bill decreases. Pretty good deal. CA  So that seems like a win for the consumer. No risk  you'll pay less than you're paying now. For you  the dream here then is that    I mean  who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term  I mean  how do you  the company  benefit  EM  Well  essentially  SolarCity raises a chunk of capital from say  a company or a bank. Google is one of our big partners here. And they have an expected return on that capital. With that capital  SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment  which is less than the utility bill. CA  But you yourself get a long term commercial benefit from that power. You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility. EM  Exactly. What it amounts to is a giant distributed utility. I think it's a good thing  because utilities have been this monopoly  and people haven't had any choice. So effectively it's the first time there's been competition for this monopoly  because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines  but now it's on your roof. So I think it's actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses. CA  And you really picture a future where a majority of power in America  within a decade or two  or within your lifetime  it goes solar  EM  I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power  and most likely a majority  and I predict it will be a plurality in less than    years. I made that bet with someone  CA  Definition of plurality is  EM  More from solar than any other source. CA  Ah. Who did you make the bet with  EM  With a friend who will remain nameless. CA  Just between us.  Laughter  EM  I made that bet  I think  two or three years ago  so in roughly    years  I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source. CA  All right  so let's go back to another bet that you made with yourself  I guess  a kind of crazy bet. You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal. You decided to build a space company. Why on Earth would someone do that  EM  I got that question a lot  that's true. People would say   Did you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry   Obviously   He started with a large one   is the punchline. And so I tell people  well  I was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one. And they'd look at me  like   Is he serious   CA  And strangely  you were. So what happened  EM  It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out. We came very close to failure  but we managed to get through that point in     . The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology  and in particular to try to crack a problem that I think is vital for humanity to become a space faring civilization  which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket. CA  Would humanity become a space faring civilization  So that was a dream of yours  in a way  from a young age  You've dreamed of Mars and beyond  EM  I did build rockets when I was a kid  but I didn't think I'd be involved in this. It was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one  And I really think there's a fundamental difference  if you sort of look into the future  between a humanity that is a space faring civilization  that's out there exploring the stars  on multiple planets  and I think that's really exciting  compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event. CA  So you've somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by    percent  depending on how you calculate it. How on Earth have you done that  NASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this  EM  Well  we've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe  the engines  the electronics and the launch operation. There's a long list of innovations that we've come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk  but    CA  Not least because you could still get copied  right  You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me. EM  No  we don't patent.CA  You didn't patent because you think it's more dangerous to patent than not to patent. EM  Since our primary competitors are national governments  the enforceability of patents is questionable. Laughter   Applause  CA  That's really  really interesting. But the big innovation is still ahead  and you're working on it now. Tell us about this. EM  Right  so the big innovation  CA  In fact  let's roll that video and you can talk us through it  what's happening here. EM  Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that they're all expendable. All rockets that fly today are fully expendable. The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket  but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time  and the parts that were reusable took a        person group nine months to refurbish for flight. So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight. Obviously that doesn't work very well for   CA  What just happened there  We just saw something land  EM  That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages be able to come back  to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours. CA  Wow. Reusable rockets.EM  Yes.  Applause  And so what a lot of people don't realize is  the cost of the fuel  of the propellant  is very small. It's much like on a jet. So the cost of the propellant is about .  percent of the cost of the rocket. So it's possible to achieve  let's say  roughly     fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket. That's why it's so important. Every mode of transport that we use  whether it's planes  trains  automobiles  bikes  horses  is reusable  but not rockets. So we must solve this problem in order to become a space faring civilization. CA  You asked me the question earlier of how popular traveling on cruises would be if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM  Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic. CA  Definitely more expensive. So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology  and  I guess  paves the way for your dream to actually take  at some point  to take humanity to Mars at scale. You'd like to see a colony on Mars. EM  Yeah  exactly. SpaceX  or some combination of companies and governments  needs to make progress in the direction of making life multi planetary  of establishing a base on another planet  on Mars    being the only realistic option    and then building that base up until we're a true multi planet species. CA  So progress on this  let's make it reusable   how is that going  That was just a simulation video we saw. How's it going  EM  We're actually  we've been making some good progress recently with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project  where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight  the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky. And we've had some good tests. CA  Can we see that EM  Yeah. So that's just to give a sense of scale. We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket.  Laughter  CA  All right  let's see that video then  because this is actually amazing when you think about it. You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then    EM  Yeah  so that rocket is about the size of a    story building. So now it's hovering at about    meters  and it's constantly adjusting the angle  the pitch  and yaw of the main engine  and maintaining roll  with cold gas thrusters. CA  How cool is that   Applause  Elon  how have you done this  These projects are so    Paypal  SolarCity  Tesla  SpaceX  they're so spectacularly different  they're such ambitious projects at scale. How on Earth has one person been able to innovate in this way  What is it about you  EM  I don't know  actually. I don't have a good answer for you. I work a lot. I mean  a lot. CA  Well  I have a theory.EM  Okay. All right. CA  My theory is that you have an ability to think at a system level of design that pulls together design  technology and business  so if TED was TBD  design  technology and business  into one package  synthesize it in a way that very few people can and    and this is the critical thing    feel so damn confident in that clicked together package that you take crazy risks. You bet your fortune on it  and you seem to have done that multiple times. I mean  almost no one can do that. Is that    could we have some of that secret sauce  Can we put it into our education system  Can someone learn from you  It is truly amazing what you've done. EM  Well  thanks. Thank you. Well  I do think there's a good framework for thinking. It is physics. You know  the sort of first principles reasoning. Generally I think there are    what I mean by that is  boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there  as opposed to reasoning by analogy. Through most of our life  we get through life by reasoning by analogy  which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations. And you have to do that. Otherwise  mentally  you wouldn't be able to get through the day. But when you want to do something new  you have to apply the physics approach. Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive  like quantum mechanics. It's really counterintuitive. So I think that's an important thing to do  and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback  and solicit it  particularly from friends. This may sound like simple advice  but hardly anyone does that  and it's incredibly helpful. CA  Boys and girls watching  study physics. Learn from this man. Elon Musk  I wish we had all day  but thank you so much for coming to TED. EM  Thank you. CA  That was awesome. That was really  really cool. Look at that.  Applause  Just take a bow. That was fantastic. Thank you so much. When I was little  I thought my country was the best on the planet. And I grew up singing a song called  Nothing To Envy.  And I was very proud. In school  we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il Sung  but we never learned much about the outside world  except that America  South Korea  Japan are the enemies. Although I often wondered about the outside world  I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea  until everything suddenly changed. When I was seven years old  I saw my first public execution. But I thought my life in North Korea was normal. My family was not poor  and myself  I had never experienced hunger. But one day  in       my mom brought home a letter from a coworker's sister. It read   When you read this  our five family members will not exist in this world  because we haven't eaten for the past three weeks. We are lying on the floor together  and our bodies are so weak  we are waiting to die.  I was so shocked. This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering. Soon after  when I was walking past a train station  I saw something terrible that to this day I can't erase from my memory. A lifeless woman was lying on the ground  while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother's face. But nobody helped them  because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families. A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid     s. Ultimately  more than a million North Koreans died during the famine  and many only survived by eating grass  bugs and tree bark. Power outages also became more and more frequent  so everything around me was completely dark at night  except for the sea of lights in China  just across the river from my home. I always wondered why they had lights  but we didn't. This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night  compared to neighbors. This is the Amnok River  which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China. As you can see  the river can be very narrow at certain points  allowing North Koreans to secretly cross. But many die. Sometimes  I saw dead bodies floating down the river. I can't reveal many details about how I left North Korea  but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine  I was sent to China to live with distant relatives. But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time. I could have never imagined that it would take    years to live together. In China  it was hard living as a young girl without my family. I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee. But I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult  it's also very dangerous  since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants. So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed  and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate  back in North Korea. One day  my worst nightmare came true  when I was caught by the Chinese police  and brought to the police station for interrogation. Someone had accused me of being North Korean  so they tested my Chinese language abilities  and asked me tons of questions. I was so scared. I thought my heart was going to explode. If anything seemed unnatural  I could be imprisoned and repatriated. I thought my life was over. But I managed to control all the emotions inside me  and answer the questions. After they finished questioning me  one official said to another   This was a false report. She's not North Korean.  And they let me go. It was a miracle. Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies. But many can be caught by the Chinese police  and repatriated. These girls were so lucky. Even though they were caught  they were eventually released  after heavy international pressure. These North Koreans were not so lucky. Every year  countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea  where they can be tortured  imprisoned  or publicly executed. Even though I was really fortunate to get out  many other North Koreans have not been so lucky. It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive. Even after learning a new language and getting a job  their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant. That's why  after    years of hiding my identity  I decided to risk going to South Korea. And I started a new life yet again. Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected. English was so important in South Korea  so I had to start learning my third language. Also  I realized there was a wide gap between North and South. We are all Korean  but inside  we have become very different  due to    years of division. I even went through an identity crisis. Am I South Korean or North Korean  Where am I from  Who am I  Suddenly  there was no country I could proudly call my own. Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy  I made a plan    I started studying for the university entrance exam. Just as I was starting to get used to my new life  I received a shocking phone call. The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family  and  as a punishment  my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside. They had to get out quickly. So I started planning how to help them escape. North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom. It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. So  ironically  I took a flight back to China and headed toward the North Korean border. Since my family couldn't speak Chinese  I had to guide them somehow through more than       miles in China  and then into Southeast Asia. The journey by bus took one week  and we were almost caught several times. One time  our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer. He took everyone's I.D. cards  and he started asking them questions. Since my family couldn't understand Chinese  I thought my family was going to be arrested. As the Chinese officer approached my family  I impulsively stood up  and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning. He looked at me suspiciously  but luckily  he believed me. We made it all the way to the border of Laos. But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos. But even after we got past the border  my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing. After I paid the fine and bribe  my family was released in one month. But soon after  my family was arrested and jailed again  in the capital of Laos. This was one of the lowest points in my life. I did everything to get my family to freedom  and we came so close  but my family was thrown in jail  just a short distance from the South Korean embassy. I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station  desperately trying to get my family out. but I didn't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore. I lost all hope. At that moment  I heard one man's voice ask me   What's wrong   I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask. In my broken English  and with a dictionary  I explained the situation  and without hesitating  the man went to the ATM  and he paid the rest of the money for my family  and two other North Koreans to get out of jail. I thanked him with all my heart  and I asked him   Why are you helping me    I'm not helping you   he said.  I'm helping the North Korean people.  I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life. The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people  when we needed it most. And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need. Eventually  after our long journey  my family and I were reunited in South Korea. But getting to freedom is only half the battle. Many North Koreans are separated from their families  and when they arrive in a new country  they start with little or no money. So we can benefit from the international community for education  English language training  job training  and more. We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world. Because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside  and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside. I've been so lucky  received so much help and inspiration in my life  so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support. I'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world  including the TED stage. Thank you. So let me ask for a show of hands. How many people here are over the age of     Well  there do seem to be a few. Well  congratulations  because if you look at this particular slide of U.S. life expectancy  you are now in excess of the average life span of somebody who was born in     . But look what happened in the course of that century. If you follow that curve  you'll see that it starts way down there. There's that dip there for the      flu. And here we are at       average life expectancy of a child born today  age     and we are not done yet. Now  that's the good news. But there's still a lot of work to do. So  for instance  if you ask  how many diseases do we now know the exact molecular basis  Turns out it's about        which is pretty amazing  because most of those molecular discoveries have just happened in the last little while. It's exciting to see that in terms of what we've learned  but how many of those       diseases now have treatments available  Only about    . So we have this huge challenge  this huge gap. You would think this wouldn't be too hard  that we would simply have the ability to take this fundamental information that we're learning about how it is that basic biology teaches us about the causes of disease and build a bridge across this yawning gap between what we've learned about basic science and its application  a bridge that would look maybe something like this  where you'd have to put together a nice shiny way to get from one side to the other. Well  wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy  Unfortunately  it's not. In reality  trying to go from fundamental knowledge to its application is more like this. There are no shiny bridges. You sort of place your bets. Maybe you've got a swimmer and a rowboat and a sailboat and a tugboat and you set them off on their way  and the rains come and the lightning flashes  and oh my gosh  there are sharks in the water and the swimmer gets into trouble  and  uh oh  the swimmer drowned and the sailboat capsized  and that tugboat  well  it hit the rocks  and maybe if you're lucky  somebody gets across. Well  what does this really look like  Well  what is it to make a therapeutic  anyway  What's a drug  A drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen  carbon  oxygen  nitrogen  and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape  and it's those shapes that determine whether  in fact  that particular drug is going to hit its target. Is it going to land where it's supposed to  So look at this picture here    a lot of shapes dancing around for you. Now what you need to do  if you're trying to develop a new treatment for autism or Alzheimer's disease or cancer is to find the right shape in that mix that will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe. And when you look at what happens to that pipeline  you start out maybe with thousands  tens of thousands of compounds. You weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail. Ultimately  maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these  and if all goes well     years after you started  you will get one approval. And it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars for that one success. So we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would  and say   How can we do better   And that's the main theme of what I want to say to you this morning. How can we make this go faster  How can we make it more successful  Well  let me tell you about a few examples where this has actually worked. One that has just happened in the last few months is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis. But it's taken a long time to get there. Cystic fibrosis had its molecular cause discovered in      by my group working with another group in Toronto  discovering what the mutation was in a particular gene on chromosome  . That picture you see there  Here it is. That's the same kid. That's Danny Bessette     years later  because this is the year  and it's also the year where Danny got married  where we have  for the first time  the approval by the FDA of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis based upon all this molecular understanding. That's the good news. The bad news is  this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis  and it won't work for Danny  and we're still waiting for that next generation to help him. But it took    years to get this far. That's too long. How do we go faster  Well  one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology  and a very important technology that we depend on for all of this is the human genome  the ability to be able to look at a chromosome  to unzip it  to pull out all the DNA  and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code  the A's  C's  G's and T's that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things  and the cost of doing this  which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars  has in the course of the last    years fallen faster than Moore's Law  down to the point where it is less than        dollars today to have your genome sequenced  or mine  and we're headed for the        genome fairly soon. Well  that's exciting. How does that play out in terms of application to a disease  I want to tell you about another disorder. This one is a disorder which is quite rare. It's called Hutchinson Gilford progeria  and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging. Only about one in every four million kids has this disease  and in a simple way  what happens is  because of a mutation in a particular gene  a protein is made that's toxic to the cell and it causes these individuals to age at about seven times the normal rate. Let me show you a video of what that does to the cell. The normal cell  if you looked at it under the microscope  would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell  which is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries and it looks kind of like that. A progeria cell  on the other hand  because of this toxic protein called progerin  has these lumps and bumps in it. So what we would like to do after discovering this back in      is to come up with a way to try to correct that. Well again  by knowing something about the molecular pathways  it was possible to pick one of those many  many compounds that might have been useful and try it out. In an experiment done in cell culture and shown here in a cartoon  if you take that particular compound and you add it to that cell that has progeria  and you watch to see what happened  in just    hours  that cell becomes  for all purposes that we can determine  almost like a normal cell. Well that was exciting  but would it actually work in a real human being  This has led  in the space of only four years from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial  to a test of that very compound. And the kids that you see here all volunteered to be part of this     of them  and you can see as soon as the picture comes up that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people all afflicted by this disease  all looking quite similar to each other. And instead of telling you more about it  I'm going to invite one of them  Sam Berns from Boston  who's here this morning  to come up on the stage and tell us about his experience as a child affected with progeria. Sam is    years old. His parents  Scott Berns and Leslie Gordon  both physicians  are here with us this morning as well. Sam  please have a seat. So Sam  why don't you tell these folks what it's like being affected with this condition called progeria  Sam Burns  Well  progeria limits me in some ways. I cannot play sports or do physical activities  but I have been able to take interest in things that progeria  luckily  does not limit. But when there is something that I really do want to do that progeria gets in the way of  like marching band or umpiring  we always find a way to do it  and that just shows that progeria isn't in control of my life. Francis Collins  So what would you like to say to researchers here in the auditorium and others listening to this  What would you say to them both about research on progeria and maybe about other conditions as well  SB  Well  research on progeria has come so far in less than    years  and that just shows the drive that researchers can have to get this far  and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with progeria  and it shows that if that drive exists  anybody can cure any disease  and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future  and so we can eliminate those       diseases that Francis was talking about. FC  Excellent. So Sam took the day off from school today to be here  and he is    Applause     He is  by the way  a straight A  student in the ninth grade in his school in Boston. Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam. SB  Thank you very much. FC  Well done. Well done  buddy. So I just want to say a couple more things about that particular story  and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases  as Sam says  these       that are waiting for answers. You might have noticed that the drug that is now in clinical trial for progeria is not a drug that was designed for that. It's such a rare disease  it would be hard for a company to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug. This is a drug that was developed for cancer. Turned out  it didn't work very well for cancer  but it has exactly the right properties  the right shape  to work for progeria  and that's what's happened. Wouldn't it be great if we could do that more systematically  Could we  in fact  encourage all the companies that are out there that have drugs in their freezers that are known to be safe in humans but have never actually succeeded in terms of being effective for the treatments they were tried for  Now we're learning about all these new molecular pathways    some of those could be repositioned or repurposed  or whatever word you want to use  for new applications  basically teaching old drugs new tricks. That could be a phenomenal  valuable activity. We have many discussions now between NIH and companies about doing this that are looking very promising. And you could expect quite a lot to come from this. There are quite a number of success stories one can point to about how this has led to major advances. The first drug for HIV AIDS was not developed for HIV AIDS. It was developed for cancer. It was AZT. It didn't work very well for cancer  but became the first successful antiretroviral  and you can see from the table there are others as well. So how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort  Well  we have to come up with a partnership between academia  government  the private sector  and patient organizations to make that so. At NIH  we have started this new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. It just started last December  and this is one of its goals. Let me tell you another thing we could do. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to a test a drug to see if it's effective and safe without having to put patients at risk  because that first time you're never quite sure  How do we know  for instance  whether drugs are safe before we give them to people  We test them on animals. And it's not all that reliable  and it's costly  and it's time consuming. Suppose we could do this instead on human cells. You probably know  if you've been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us. So what if you used those cells as your test for whether a drug is going to work and whether it's going to be safe  Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip. This is something created by the Wyss Institute in Boston  and what they have done here  if we can run the little video  is to take cells from an individual  turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung  and determine what would happen if you added to this various drug compounds to see if they are toxic or safe. You can see this chip even breathes. It has an air channel. It has a blood channel. And it has cells in between that allow you to see what happens when you add a compound. Are those cells happy or not  You can do this same kind of chip technology for kidneys  for hearts  for muscles  all the places where you want to see whether a drug is going to be a problem  for the liver. And ultimately  because you can do this for the individual  we could even see this moving to the point where the ability to develop and test medicines will be you on a chip  what we're trying to say here is the individualizing of the process of developing drugs and testing their safety. So let me sum up. We are in a remarkable moment here. For me  at NIH now for almost    years  there has never been a time where there was more excitement about the potential that lies in front of us. We have made all these discoveries pouring out of laboratories across the world. What do we need to capitalize on this  First of all  we need resources. This is research that's high risk  sometimes high cost. The payoff is enormous  both in terms of health and in terms of economic growth. We need to support that. Second  we need new kinds of partnerships between academia and government and the private sector and patient organizations  just like the one I've been describing here  in terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds. And third  and maybe most important  we need talent. We need the best and the brightest from many different disciplines to come and join this effort    all ages  all different groups    because this is the time  folks. This is the   st century biology that you've been waiting for  and we have the chance to take that and turn it into something which will  in fact  knock out disease. That's my goal. I hope that's your goal. I think it'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets and the surfers and the bankers and all the other people who join this stage and think about what we're trying to do here and why it matters. It matters for now. It matters as soon as possible. If you don't believe me  just ask Sam. Thank you all very much. In      I had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life. I was in the third year of my seven year undergraduate degree. I took a couple victory laps in there. And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California  and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus  and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains. And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise  and as we sat there  over the mountains coming in from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds rolling toward us  and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley  so help me God  every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time. And then the clouds came over us  and then  boom  This massive thunderclap  and sheets of rain. It was just extraordinary  and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz  and decided to set it to music  a piece for choir called  Cloudburst   which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment. Now fast forward to just three years ago. the Virtual Choir Project      singers from    different countries. You can see my little video there conducting these people  alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home. Two years ago  on this very stage  we premiered Virtual Choir          singers from    different countries  this time performing a piece that I had written called  Sleep.  And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir     Water Night   another piece that I had written  this time nearly       singers from    different countries. And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this  he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could. Could we do this all in real time  Could we have people singing together in real time  And with the help of Skype  that is what we are going to attempt today. Now  we'll perform  Cloudburst  for you. The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage. I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach  Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College  some of the best amateur choirs in the country  and   and in the second half of the piece  the virtual choir will join us     different singers from    different countries. Now  we've pushed the technology as far as it can go  but there's still less than a second of latency  but in musical terms  that's a lifetime. We deal in milliseconds. So what I've done is  I've adapted  Cloudburst  so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together. So with deep humility  and for your approval  we present  Cloudburst.   The rain ...   Eyes of shadow water   eyes of well water   eyes of dream water.   Blue suns  green whirlwinds    birdbeaks of light pecking open   pomegranate stars.   But tell me  burnt earth  is there no water    Only blood  only dust    only naked footsteps on the thorns    The rain awakens...   We must sleep with open eyes    we must dream with our hands    we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course    of the sun dreaming its worlds.   We must dream aloud    we must sing till the song puts forth roots    trunk  branches  birds  stars.   We must find the lost word    and remember what the blood    the tides  the earth  and the body say    and return to the point of departure...    Cloudburst  Octavio Paz  translation by Lysander Kemp  adapted by Eric Whitacre  Eric Whitacre  Beth. Annabelle  where are you  Jacob. Thank you. Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms  bacteria  viruses and fungi. Our desks  our computers  our pencils  our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes. As we design these things  we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds  and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems. Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes  and these creatures define who we are. The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods. The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system. The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath  or not  and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch. So  for example  when you touch a pencil  microbial exchange happens. If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings  this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways. I get asked all of the time from people   Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems   And I believe the answer is yes. I think we're doing it right now  but we're doing it unconsciously. I'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how  through both conscious and unconscious design  we're impacting these invisible worlds. This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon  and I worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over     rooms in this building. We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building  and to do this  we sampled dust. From the dust  we pulled out bacterial cells  broke them open  and compared their gene sequences. This means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project. This is a picture of Tim  who  right when I snapped this picture  reminded me  he said   Jessica  the last lab group I worked in I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest  and things have changed dramatically for me.  So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices  and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk. The way that you look at this data is  first  look around the outside of the circle. You'll see broad bacterial groups  and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe  it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group. So at    o'clock  you'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria  and at one o'clock you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare. Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building. If you look inside the restrooms  they all have really similar ecosystems  and if you were to look inside the classrooms  those also have similar ecosystems. But if you look across these space types  you can see that they're fundamentally different from one another. I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest. I told Tim   If you could just see the microbes  it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of.  And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland. This perspective is a really powerful one for designers  because you can bring on principles of ecology  and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal  the way organisms move around. We know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air. So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system. Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable  that the air flow and temperature is just right. They do this using principles of physics and chemistry  but they could also be using biology. If you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building  you'll see that they're all very similar to one another. And if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit  you'll see that they're fundamentally different. The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago  and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco engineers  and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to. Another facet of how microbes get around is by people  and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people  or the sharing of ideas  like in labs and in offices. Given that microbes travel around with people  you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes. And that is exactly what we found. If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another  they have very similar ecosystems  but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away  the ecosystem is fundamentally different. And when I see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns  it makes me think that it's possible to tackle really challenging problems  like hospital acquired infections. I believe this has got to be  in part  a building ecology problem. All right  I'm going to tell you one more story about this building. I am collaborating with Charlie Brown. He's an architect  and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change. He's dedicated his life to sustainable design. When he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building  he got really excited  because it added a new dimension to what he did. He went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health. He helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated. So what I'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building. What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air  and how they vary over time. Next I'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms. We blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation. A lot of buildings are operated this way  probably where you work  and companies do this to save money on their energy bill. What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until Saturday  when we opened the vents up again. When you walked into those rooms  they smelled really bad  and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before. Contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers. In these rooms  the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well  and when Charlie saw this  he got really excited. He felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape. The examples that I just gave you are about architecture  but they're relevant to the design of anything. Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone. There's a new microbe  I just discovered it. It's called BLIS  and it's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath. Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones  A conscious approach to design  I'm calling it bioinformed design  and I think it's possible. Thank you. I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at. You're about to experience a new  available and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives. What I have here is a cinder block that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material. It's called Ultra Ever Dry  and when you apply it to any material  it turns into a superhydrophobic shield. So this is a cinder block  uncoated  and you can see that it's porous  it absorbs water. Not anymore. Porous  nonporous. So what's superhydrophobic  Superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface. The rounder it is  the more hydrophobic it is  and if it's really round  it's superhydrophobic. A freshly waxed car  the water molecules slump to about    degrees. A windshield coating is going to give you about     degrees. But what you're seeing here is     to     degrees  and anything over     is superhydrophobic. So as part of the demonstration  what I have is a pair of gloves  and we've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating  and let's see if you can tell which one  and I'll give you a hint. Did you guess the one that was dry  When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience  what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits. And we're talking really small here. The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers  and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter  and to put some scale to that  if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick  and you put it side by side  and you had        of them  you'd be the width of a human hair. So very small  but very useful. And it's not just water that this works with. It's a lot of water based materials like concrete  water based paint  mud  and also some refined oils as well. You can see the difference. Moving onto the next demonstration  we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it  we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating  and we're going to pour this green tinted water inside the middle  and you're going to see  it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would  except when it hits the coating  it stops  and I can't even coax it to leave. It's that afraid of the water. So what's going on here  What's happening  Well  the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface. You'd think it'd be smooth  but it's actually not. And it has billions of interstitial spaces  and those spaces  along with the nanoparticles  reach up and grab the air molecules  and cover the surface with air. It's an umbrella of air all across it  and that layer of air is what the water hits  the mud hits  the concrete hits  and it glides right off. So if I put this inside this water here  you can see a silver reflective coating around it  and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle  and it's dry. So what are the applications  I mean  many of you right now are probably going through your head. Everyone that sees this gets excited  and says   Oh  I could use it for this and this and this.  The applications in a general sense could be anything that's anti wetting. We've certainly seen that today. It could be anything that's anti icing  because if you don't have water  you don't have ice. It could be anti corrosion. No water  no corrosion. It could be anti bacterial. Without water  the bacteria won't survive. And it could be things that need to be self cleaning as well. So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work. And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration  but before I do that  I would like to say thank you  and think small. It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it. Chris Anderson  You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED   Laughter   Two minutes later...  He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part. It's happening  This is where I live. I live in Kenya  at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park. Those are my dad's cows at the back  and behind the cows  that's the Nairobi National Park. Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely  which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely. So predators like lions follow them  and this is what they do. They kill our livestock. This is one of the cows which was killed at night  and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead  and I felt so bad  because it was the only bull we had. My community  the Maasai  we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them  and that's why we value them so much. So I grew up hating lions so much. The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock  and they're also upset about this problem. So they kill the lions. It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi. And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few. So a boy  from six to nine years old  in my community is responsible for his dad's cows  and that's the same thing which happened to me. So I had to find a way of solving this problem. And the first idea I got was to use fire  because I thought lions were scared of fire. But I came to realize that that didn't really help  because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed. So I didn't give up. I continued. And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow. I was trying to trick the lions  into thinking  that I was standing near the cowshed. But lions are very clever.  Laughter  They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow  and they go back  but the second day  they'll come and they say  this thing is not moving here  it's always here.  Laughter  So he jumps in and kills the animals. So one night  I was walking around the cowshed with a torch  and that day  the lions didn't come. And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light. So I had an idea. Since I was a small boy  I used to work in my room for the whole day  and I even took apart my mom's new radio  and that day she almost killed me  but I learned a lot about electronics.  Laughter  So I got an old car battery  an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle  and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks. And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights  on and off. And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight. So I set up everything. As you can see  the solar panel charges the battery  and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer. And the indicator box makes the lights flash. As you can see  the bulbs face outside  because that's where the lions come from. And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night. The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed  but I was sleeping in my bed. Thanks. So I set it up in my home two years ago  and since then  we have never experienced any problem with lions. And my neighboring homes heard about this idea. One of them was this grandmother. She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions  and she asked me if I could put the lights for her. And I said   Yes.  So I put the lights. You can see at the back  those are the lion lights. Since now  I've set up seven homes around my community  and they're really working. And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas  leopards  and it's also being used to scare elephants away from people's farms. Because of this invention  I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya  Brookhouse International School  and I'm really excited about this. My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness. I even took my friends back to my community  and we're installing the lights to the homes which don't have  any   and I'm teaching them how to put them. So one year ago  I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father's cows  and I used to see planes flying over  and I told myself that one day  I'll be there inside. And here I am today. I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED. So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up. I used to hate lions  but now because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions  we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict. Ash  ol n. It means in my language  thank you very much. Chris Anderson  You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours. So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere  Yep. CA  You're working on other electrical inventions. What's the next one on your list  RT  My next invention is  I want to make an electric fence.CA  Electric fence  RT  But I know electric fences are already invented  but I want to make mine. CA  You already tried it once  right  and you   RT  I tried it before  but I stopped because it gave me a shock.  Laughter  CA  In the trenches. Richard Turere  you are something else. We're going to cheer you on every step of the way  my friend. Thank you so much.RT  Thank you.  Applause  I'm going to talk about the strategizing brain. We're going to use an unusual combination of tools from game theory and neuroscience to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line. So game theory is a branch of  originally  applied mathematics  used mostly in economics and political science  a little bit in biology  that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life and it predicts what people are likely to do and believe others will do in cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else. That's a lot of things  competition  cooperation  bargaining  games like hide and seek  and poker. Here's a simple game to get us started. Everyone chooses a number from zero to      we're going to compute the average of those numbers  and whoever's closest to two thirds of the average wins a fixed prize. So you want to be a little bit below the average number  but not too far below  and everyone else wants to be a little bit below the average number as well. Think about what you might pick. As you're thinking  this is a toy model of something like selling in the stock market during a rising market. Right  You don't want to sell too early  because you miss out on profits  but you don't want to wait too late to when everyone else sells  triggering a crash. You want to be a little bit ahead of the competition  but not too far ahead. Okay  here's two theories about how people might think about this  and then we'll see some data. Some of these will sound familiar because you probably are thinking that way. I'm using my brain theory to see. A lot of people say   I really don't know what people are going to pick  so I think the average will be   .  They're not being really strategic at all.  And I'll pick two thirds of   . That's   .  That's a start. Other people who are a little more sophisticated  using more working memory  say   I think people will pick    because they're going to pick a response to     and so I'll pick     which is two thirds of   .  They're doing one extra step of thinking  two steps. That's better. And of course  in principle  you could do three  four or more  but it starts to get very difficult. Just like in language and other domains  we know that it's hard for people to parse very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure. This is called a cognitive hierarchy theory  by the way. It's something that I've worked on and a few other people  and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected by lots of interesting variables and variant people  as we'll see in a minute. A very different theory  a much more popular one  and an older one  due largely to John Nash of  A Beautiful Mind  fame  is what's called equilibrium analysis. So if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level  you will have learned a little bit about this. An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody has figured out exactly what everyone else will do. It is a very useful concept  but behaviorally  it may not exactly explain what people do the first time they play these types of economic games or in situations in the outside world. In this case  the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction  which is everyone wants to be below everyone else  therefore they'll play zero. Let's see what happens. This experiment's been done many  many times. Some of the earliest ones were done in the '  s by me and Rosemarie Nagel and others. This is a beautiful data set of       people who wrote in to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest. The contest said  send in your numbers and whoever is close to two thirds of the average will win a big prize. And as you can see  there's so much data here  you can see the spikes very visibly. There's a spike at   . Those are people doing one step. There is another spike visible at   . And notice  by the way  that most people pick numbers right around there. They don't necessarily pick exactly    and   . There's something a little bit noisy around it. But you can see those spikes  and they're there. There's another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis  because they're picking zero or one. But they lose  right  Because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice if other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well. So they're smart  but poor. Where are these things happening in the brain  One study by Coricelli and Nagel gives a really sharp  interesting answer. So they had people play this game while they were being scanned in an fMRI  and two conditions  in some trials  they're told you're playing another person who's playing right now and we're going to match up your behavior at the end and pay you if you win. In the other trials  they're told  you're playing a computer. They're just choosing randomly. So what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there's more brain activity when you're playing people compared to playing the computer. And you see activity in some regions we've seen today  medial prefrontal cortex  dorsomedial  however  up here  ventromedial prefrontal cortex  anterior cingulate  an area that's involved in lots of types of conflict resolution  like if you're playing  Simon Says   and also the right and left temporoparietal junction. And these are all areas which are fairly reliably known to be part of what's called a  theory of mind  circuit  or  mentalizing circuit.  That is  it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do. So these were some of the first studies to see this tied in to game theory. What happens with these one  and two step types  So we classify people by what they picked  and then we look at the difference between playing humans versus playing computers  which brain areas are differentially active. On the top you see the one step players. There's almost no difference. The reason is  they're treating other people like a computer  and the brain is too. The bottom players  you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC. So we know that those two step players are doing something differently. Now if you were to step back and say   What can we do with this information   you might be able to look at brain activity and say   This person's going to be a good poker player   or   This person's socially naive   and we might also be able to study things like development of adolescent brains once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists. Okay. Get ready. I'm saving you some brain activity  because you don't need to use your hair detector cells. You should use those cells to think carefully about this game. This is a bargaining game. Two players who are being scanned using EEG electrodes are going to bargain over one to six dollars. If they can do it in    seconds  they're going to actually earn that money. If    seconds goes by and they haven't made a deal  they get nothing. That's kind of a mistake together. The twist is that one player  on the left  is informed about how much on each trial there is. They play lots of trials with different amounts each time. In this case  they know there's four dollars. The uninformed player doesn't know  but they know that the informed player knows. So the uninformed player's challenge is to say   Is this guy really being fair or are they giving me a very low offer in order to get me to think that there's only one or two dollars available to split   in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal. So there's some tension here between trying to get the most money but trying to goad the other player into giving you more. And the way they bargain is to point on a number line that goes from zero to six dollars  and they're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets  and the informed player's going to get the rest. So this is like a management labor negotiation in which the workers don't know how much profits the privately held company has  right  and they want to maybe hold out for more money  but the company might want to create the impression that there's very little to split   I'm giving you the most that I can.  First some behavior. So a bunch of the subject pairs  they play face to face. We have some other data where they play across computers. That's an interesting difference  as you might imagine. But a bunch of the face to face pairs agree to divide the money evenly every single time. Boring. It's just not interesting neurally. It's good for them. They make a lot of money. But we're interested in  can we say something about when disagreements occur versus don't occur  So this is the other group of subjects who often disagree. So they have a chance of    they bicker and disagree and end up with less money. They might be eligible to be on  Real Housewives   the TV show. You see on the left  when the amount to divide is one  two or three dollars  they disagree about half the time  and when the amount is four  five  six  they agree quite often. This turns out to be something that's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about. It's a little too complicated to explain right now  but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur. Your intuition might tell you that too. Now I'm going to show you the results from the EEG recording. Very complicated. The right brain schematic is the uninformed person  and the left is the informed. Remember that we scanned both brains at the same time  so we can ask about time synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously  just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you'd expect common activity in language regions when they're actually kind of listening and communicating. So the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time  and the direction of the arrows flows from the region that's active first in time  and the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later. So in this case  if you look carefully  most of the arrows flow from right to left. That is  it looks as if the uninformed brain activity is happening first  and then it's followed by activity in the informed brain. And by the way  these were trials where their deals were made. This is from the first two seconds. We haven't finished analyzing this data  so we're still peeking in  but the hope is that we can say something in the first couple of seconds about whether they'll make a deal or not  which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation and ugly divorces and things like that. Those are all cases in which a lot of value is lost by delay and strikes. Here's the case where the disagreements occur. You can see it looks different than the one before. There's a lot more arrows. That means that the brains are synced up more closely in terms of simultaneous activity  and the arrows flow clearly from left to right. That is  the informed brain seems to be deciding   We're probably not going to make a deal here.  And then later there's activity in the uninformed brain. Next I'm going to introduce you to some relatives. They're hairy  smelly  fast and strong. You might be thinking back to your last Thanksgiving. Maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you. Charles Darwin and I and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five million years ago. They're still our closest genetic kin. We share   .  percent of the genes. We share more genes with them than zebras do with horses. And we're also their closest cousin. They have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas. So how humans and chimpanzees behave differently might tell us a lot about brain evolution. So this is an amazing memory test from Nagoya  Japan  Primate Research Institute  where they've done a lot of this research. This goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory. The chimp is going to see  watch carefully  they're going to see     milliseconds' exposure   that's fast  that's eight movie frames   of numbers one  two  three  four  five. Then they disappear and they're replaced by squares  and they have to press the squares that correspond to the numbers from low to high to get an apple reward. Let's see how they can do it. This is a young chimp. The young ones are better than the old ones  just like humans. And they're highly experienced  so they've done this thousands and thousands of time. Obviously there's a big training effect  as you can imagine. You can see they're very blas  and kind of effortless. Not only can they do it very well  they do it in a sort of lazy way. Right  Who thinks you could beat the chimps  Wrong.  Laughter  We can try. We'll try. Maybe we'll try. Okay  so the next part of this study I'm going to go quickly through is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa. He had a bold idea that    what he called the cognitive trade off hypothesis. We know chimps are faster and stronger. They're also very obsessed with status. His thought was  maybe they've preserved brain activities and they practice them in development that are really  really important to them to negotiate status and to win  which is something like strategic thinking during competition. So we're going to check that out by having the chimps actually play a game by touching two touch screens. The chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers. They're going to press left or right. One chimp is called a matcher. They win if they press left  left  like a seeker finding someone in hide and seek  or right  right. The mismatcher wants to mismatch. They want to press the opposite screen of the chimp. And the rewards are apple cube rewards. So here's how game theorists look at these data. This is a graph of the percentage of times the matcher picked right on the x axis  and the percentage of times they predicted right by the mismatcher on the y axis. So a point here is the behavior by a pair of players  one trying to match  one trying to mismatch. The NE square in the middle    actually NE  CH and QRE    those are three different theories of Nash equilibrium  and others  tells you what the theory predicts  which is that they should match        because if you play left too much  for example  I can exploit that if I'm the mismatcher by then playing right. And as you can see  the chimps  each chimp is one triangle  are circled around  hovering around that prediction. Now we move the payoffs. We're actually going to make the left  left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher. Now they get three apple cubes. Game theoretically  that should actually make the mismatcher's behavior shift  because what happens is  the mismatcher will think  oh  this guy's going to go for the big reward  and so I'm going to go to the right  make sure he doesn't get it. And as you can see  their behavior moves up in the direction of this change in the Nash equilibrium. Finally  we changed the payoffs one more time. Now it's four apple cubes  and their behavior again moves towards the Nash equilibrium. It's sprinkled around  but if you average the chimps out  they're really  really close  within .  . They're actually closer than any species we've observed. What about humans  You think you're smarter than a chimpanzee  Here's two human groups in green and blue. They're closer to      . They're not responding to payoffs as closely  and also if you study their learning in the game  they aren't as sensitive to previous rewards. The chimps are playing better than the humans  better in the sense of adhering to game theory. And these are two different groups of humans from Japan and Africa. They replicate quite nicely. None of them are close to where the chimps are. So here are some things we learned today. People seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking using theory of mind. We have some preliminary evidence from bargaining that early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict whether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money  and chimps are better competitors than humans  as judged by game theory. Thank you. This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam  where I work as a curator. It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay  and that it grows  and basically it means I collect dead animals. Back in       we got a new wing next to the museum. It was made of glass  and this building really helped me to do my job good. The building was a true bird killer. You may know that birds don't understand the concept of glass. They don't see it  so they fly into the windows and get killed. The only thing I had to do was go out  pick them up  and have them stuffed for the collection. And in those days  I developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass. And it was on June          that I heard a loud bang against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a duck. And this is what I saw when I looked out of the window. This is the dead duck. It flew against the window. It's laying dead on its belly. But next to the dead duck is a live duck  and please pay attention. Both are of the male sex. And then this happened. The live duck mounted the dead duck  and started to copulate. Well  I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist. I said   Something's wrong here.  One is dead  one is alive. That must be necrophilia. I look. Both are of the male sex. Homosexual necrophilia. So I     Laughter  I took my camera  I took my notebook  took a chair  and started to observe this behavior. After    minutes    Laughter    I had seen enough  and I got hungry  and I wanted to go home. So I went out  collected the duck  and before I put it in the freezer  I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex. And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis  so it was indeed of the male sex. It's a rare picture because there are        species of birds and only     possess a penis.  The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos  Aves Anatidae   I knew I'd seen something special  but it took me six years to decide to publish it. I mean  it's a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine  but to share this among your peers is something different. I didn't have the framework. So after six years  my friends and colleagues urged me to publish  so I published  The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard.  And here's the situation again. A is my office  B is the place where the duck hit the glass  and C is from where I watched it. And here are the ducks again. As you probably know  in science  when you write a kind of special paper  only six or seven people read it. But then something good happened. I got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams  and he told me   You've won a prize with your duck paper  the Ig Nobel Prize.  And the Ig Nobel Prize   the Ig Nobel Prize honors research that first makes people laugh  and then makes them think  with the ultimate goal to make more people interested in science. That's a good thing  so I accepted the prize. I went    let me remind you that Marc Abrahams didn't call me from Stockholm. He called me from Cambridge  Massachusetts. So I traveled to Boston  to Cambridge  and I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony held at Harvard University  and this ceremony is a very nice experience. Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize. That's the first thing. And there are nine other winners who get prizes. Here's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton who won the      biology prize for his paper   Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans under farming conditions in Britain.  And I think there are one or two more Ig Nobel Prize winners in this room. Dan  where are you  Dan Ariely  Applause for Dan. Dan won his prize in medicine for demonstrating that high priced fake medicine works better than low priced fake medicine. So here's my one minute of fame  my acceptance speech  and here's the duck. This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast. I'm going to pass it around. Yeah  You can pass it around. Please note it's a museum specimen  but there's no chance you'll get the avian flu. After winning this prize  my life changed. In the first place  people started to send me all kinds of duck related things  and I got a real nice collection. More importantly  people started to send me their observations of remarkable animal behavior  and believe me  if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet  I know about it. This is a moose. It's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison. This is in Montana      . This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish. This is the Netherlands      . These are cane toads in Australia. This is roadkill. Please note that this is necrophilia. It's remarkable  the position. The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom. These are pigeons in Rotterdam. Barn swallows in Hong Kong      . This is a turkey in Wisconsin on the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution. It took all day  and the prisoners had a great time. So what does this mean  I mean  the question I ask myself  why does this happen in nature  Well  what I concluded from reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant and in a dramatic way and in the right position for copulation. At least  I thought it was till I got these slides. And here you see a dead duck. It's been there for three days  and it's laying on its back. So there goes my theory of necrophilia. Another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds. This is Mad Max  a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam. The only thing this bird did was fly against this window from      to       day in and day out. Here he goes  and here's a short video. So what this bird does is fight his own image. He sees an intruder in his territory  and it's coming all the time and he's there  so there is no end to it. And I thought  in the beginning    I studied this bird for a couple of years    that  well  shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged  It's not. I show you here some slides  some frames from the video  and at the last moment before he hits the glass  he puts his feet in front  and then he bangs against the glass. So I'll conclude to invite you all to Dead Duck Day. That's on June   every year. At five minutes to six in the afternoon  we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam  the duck comes out of the museum  and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from colliding with windows. And as you know  or as you may not know  this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world. In the U.S. alone  a billion birds die in collision with glass buildings. And when it's over  we go to a Chinese restaurant and we have a six course duck dinner. So I hope to see you next year in Rotterdam  the Netherlands  for Dead Duck Day. Thank you. Oh  sorry. May I have my duck back  please  Thank you. Today I'm going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle  that you can carry with you anywhere  that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in    minutes  and you can run it for       kilometers on about a dollar of electricity. But when I say the word electric vehicle  people think about vehicles. They think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles  and the vehicles that you use every day. But if you come about it from a different perspective  you can create some more interesting  more novel concepts. So we built something. I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here. So this is the motor. This motor has enough power to take you up the hills of San Francisco at about    miles per hour  about    kilometers an hour  and this battery  this battery right here has about six miles of range  or    kilometers  which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the U.S. alone. But the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store. These are from remote control airplanes. And the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently  you can really change things. So today we're going to show you one example of how you can use this. Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is  but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco.    Mile Range   Top Speed Near   mph   Uphill Climbing   Regenerative Braking  So we're going to show you what this thing can do. It's really maneuverable. You have a hand held remote  so you can pretty easily control acceleration  braking  go in reverse if you like  also have braking. It's incredible just how light this thing is. I mean  this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go. So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles. This uses    times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car  which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build  but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation. So instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city  now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation. So next time you think about a vehicle  I hope  like us  you're thinking about something new. Thank you. Once upon a time  there was a place called Lesterland. Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States. Like the United States  it has about     million people  and of that     million people  it turns out         are called Lester. If Matt's in the audience  I just borrowed that  I'll return it in a second  this character from your series. So         are called Lester  which means about .   percent is named Lester. Now  Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power. There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland. One is called the general election. The other is called the Lester election. And in the general election  it's the citizens who get to vote  but in the Lester election  it's the Lesters who get to vote. And here's the trick. In order to run in the general election  you must do extremely well in the Lester election. You don't necessarily have to win  but you must do extremely well. Now  what can we say about democracy in Lesterland  What we can say  number one  as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United  that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials  because  after all  there is a general election  but only after the Lesters have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in the general election. And number two  obviously  this dependence upon the Lesters is going to produce a subtle  understated  we could say camouflaged  bending to keep the Lesters happy. Okay  so we have a democracy  no doubt  but it's dependent upon the Lesters and dependent upon the people. It has competing dependencies  we could say conflicting dependencies  depending upon who the Lesters are. Okay. That's Lesterland. Now there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland. Number one  the United States is Lesterland. The United States is Lesterland. The United States also looks like this  also has two elections  one we called the general election  the second we should call the money election. In the general election  it's the citizens who get to vote  if you're over     in some states if you have an ID. In the money election  it's the funders who get to vote  the funders who get to vote  and just like in Lesterland  the trick is  to run in the general election  you must do extremely well in the money election. You don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown. But you must do extremely well. And here's the key  There are just as few relevant funders in USA land as there are Lesters in Lesterland. Now you say  really  Really .   percent  Well  here are the numbers from       .   percent of America gave     dollars or more to any federal candidate  .   percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate  .   percent    the one percent of the one percent    gave        dollars or more to federal candidates  and in this election cycle  my favorite statistic is .       percent   for those of you doing the numbers  you know that's     Americans   gave    percent of the Super PAC money spent in the cycle we have just seen ending. So I'm just a lawyer  I look at this range of numbers  and I say it's fair for me to say it's .   percent who are our relevant funders in America. In this sense  the funders are our Lesters. Now  what can we say about this democracy in USA land  Well  as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United  we could say  of course the people have the ultimate influence over the elected officials. We have a general election  but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election. And number two  obviously  this dependence upon the funders produces a subtle  understated  camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy. Candidates for Congress and members of Congress spend between    and    percent of their time raising money to get back to Congress or to get their party back into power  and the question we need to ask is  what does it do to them  these humans  as they spend their time behind the telephone  calling people they've never met  but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent  As anyone would  as they do this  they develop a sixth sense  a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money. They become  in the words of  The X Files   shape shifters  as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money  not on issues one to     but on issues    to      . Leslie Byrne  a Democrat from Virginia  describes that when she went to Congress  she was told by a colleague   Always lean to the green.  Then to clarify  she went on   He was not an environmentalist.   Laughter  So here too we have a democracy  a democracy dependent upon the funders and dependent upon the people  competing dependencies  possibly conflicting dependencies depending upon who the funders are. Okay  the United States is Lesterland  point number one. Here's point number two. The United States is worse than Lesterland  worse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland if we Lesters got a letter from the government that said   Hey  you get to pick who gets to run in the general election   we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters. You know  there are Lesters from every part of social society. There are rich Lesters  poor Lesters  black Lesters  white Lesters  not many women Lesters  but put that to the side for one second. We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think   What could we do to make Lesterland better   It's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland. But in our land  in this land  in USA land  there are certainly some sweet Lesters out there  many of them in this room here today  but the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters  because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .   percent are not comprising it for the public interest. It's for their private interest. In this sense  the USA is worse than Lesterland. And finally  point number three  Whatever one wants to say about Lesterland  against the background of its history  its traditions  in our land  in USA land  Lesterland is a corruption  a corruption. Now  by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of Congress. I don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption. I don't mean any criminal act. The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal. It's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic. The framers gave us what they called a republic  but by a republic they meant a representative democracy  and by a representative democracy  they meant a government  as Madison put it in Federalist     that would have a branch that would be dependent upon the people alone. So here's the model of government. They have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency  but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence  no longer a dependence upon the people alone  increasingly a dependence upon the funders. Now this is a dependence too  but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people. This is a corruption. Now  there's good news and bad news about this corruption. One bit of good news is that it's bipartisan  equal opportunity corruption. It blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about. It blocks the right too  as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible. So the right wants smaller government. When Al Gore was Vice President  his team had an idea for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry. The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill  and as he reported back to me  the response was   Hell no  If we deregulate these guys  how are we going to raise money from them   This is a system that's designed to save the status quo  including the status quo of big and invasive government. It works against the left and the right  and that  you might say  is good news. But here's the bad news. It's a pathological  democracy destroying corruption  because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election  that means the tiniest number of us  the tiniest  tiniest number of us  can block reform. I know that should have been  like  a rock or something. I can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is. Block reform. Because there is an economy here  an economy of influence  an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization. It feeds on dysfunction. The worse that it is for us  the better that it is for this fundraising. Henry David Thoreau   There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.  This is the root. Okay  now  every single one of you knows this. You couldn't be here if you didn't know this  yet you ignore it. You ignore it. This is an impossible problem. You focus on the possible problems  like eradicating polio from the world  or taking an image of every single street across the globe  or building the first real universal translator  or building a fusion factory in your garage. These are the manageable problems  so you ignore   so you ignore this corruption. But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore. We need a government that works. And not works for the left or the right  but works for the left and the right  the citizens of the left and right  because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption. So I want you to take hold  to grab the issue you care the most about. Climate change is mine  but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality. Grab that issue  sit it down in front of you  look straight in its eyes  and tell it there is no Christmas this year. There will never be a Christmas. We will never get your issue solved until we fix this issue first. So it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not. Yours is the most important issue  but mine is the first issue  the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about. No sensible reform  and we cannot afford a world  a future  with no sensible reform. Okay. So how do we do it  Turns out  the analytics here are easy  simple. If the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America  the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of Americans  to spread it out  to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone. And to do this does not require a constitutional amendment  changing the First Amendment. To do this would require a single statute  a statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections  a statute of citizen funded campaigns  and there's any number of these proposals out there  Fair Elections Now Act  the American Anti Corruption Act  an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project to give vouchers to people to fund elections  an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act. Each of these would fix this corruption by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us. The analytics are easy here. It's the politics that's hard  indeed impossibly hard  because this reform would shrink K Street  and Capitol Hill  as Congressman Jim Cooper  a Democrat from Tennessee  put it  has become a farm league for K Street  a farm league for K Street. Members and staffers and bureaucrats have an increasingly common business model in their head  a business model focused on their life after government  their life as lobbyists. Fifty percent of the Senate between      and      left to become lobbyists     percent of the House. Those numbers have only gone up  and as United Republic calculated last April  the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was       percent. So it's fair to ask  how is it possible for them to change this  Now I get this skepticism. I get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility. But I don't buy it. This is a solvable issue. If you think about the issues our parents tried to solve in the   th century  issues like racism  or sexism  or the issue that we've been fighting in this century  homophobia  those are hard issues. You don't wake up one day no longer a racist. It takes generations to tear that intuition  that DNA  out of the soul of a people. But this is a problem of just incentives  just incentives. Change the incentives  and the behavior changes  and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice. When Connecticut adopted this system  in the very first year     percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took small contributions only. It's solvable  not by being a Democrat  not by being a Republican. It's solvable by being citizens  by being citizens  by being TEDizens. Because if you want to kickstart reform  look  I could kickstart reform at half the price of fixing energy policy  I could give you back a republic. Okay. But even if you're not yet with me  even if you believe this is impossible  what the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me as I've spoken about this issue again and again is  even if you think it's impossible  that is irrelevant. Irrelevant. I spoke at Dartmouth once  and a woman stood up after I spoke  I write in my book  and she said to me   Professor  you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless. There's nothing we can do.  When she said that  I scrambled. I tried to think   How do I respond to that hopelessness  What is that sense of hopelessness   And what hit me was an image of my six year old son. And I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying   Your son has terminal brain cancer  and there's nothing you can do. Nothing you can do.  So would I do nothing  Would I just sit there  Accept it  Okay  nothing I can do  I'm going off to build Google Glass. Of course not. I would do everything I could  and I would do everything I could because this is what love means  that the odds are irrelevant and that you do whatever the hell you can  the odds be damned. And then I saw the obvious link  because even we liberals love this country. And so when the pundits and the politicians say that change is impossible  what this love of country says back is   That's just irrelevant.  We lose something dear  something everyone in this room loves and cherishes  if we lose this republic  and so we act with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong. So here's my question  Do you have that love  Do you have that love  Because if you do  then what the hell are you  what are the hell are we doing  When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in September of       he was stopped in the street by a woman who said   Mr. Franklin  what have you wrought   Franklin said   A republic  madam  if you can keep it.  A republic. A representative democracy. A government dependent upon the people alone. We have lost that republic. All of us have to act to get it back. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  This is me building a prototype for six hours straight. This is slave labor to my own project. This is what the DIY and maker movements really look like. And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world with brute force assembly techniques. And this is exactly why I started studying how to program physical materials to build themselves. But there is another world. Today at the micro  and nanoscales  there's an unprecedented revolution happening. And this is the ability to program physical and biological materials to change shape  change properties and even compute outside of silicon based matter. There's even a software called cadnano that allows us to design three dimensional shapes like nano robots or drug delivery systems and use DNA to self assemble those functional structures. But if we look at the human scale  there's massive problems that aren't being addressed by those nanoscale technologies. If we look at construction and manufacturing  there's major inefficiencies  energy consumption and excessive labor techniques. In infrastructure  let's just take one example. Take piping. In water pipes  we have fixed capacity water pipes that have fixed flow rates  except for expensive pumps and valves. We bury them in the ground. If anything changes    if the environment changes  the ground moves  or demand changes    we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them. So I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds  that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials and the built environment. And I don't mean automated machines. I don't just mean smart machines that replace humans. But I mean programmable materials that build themselves. And that's called self assembly  which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure through only local interaction. So what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale  We need a few simple ingredients. The first ingredient is materials and geometry  and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source. And you can use passive energy    so heat  shaking  pneumatics  gravity  magnetics. And then you need smartly designed interactions. And those interactions allow for error correction  and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state. So now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built  from one dimensional  two dimensional  three dimensional and even four dimensional systems. So in one dimensional systems    this is a project called the self folding proteins. And the idea is that you take the three dimensional structure of a protein    in this case it's the crambin protein    you take the backbone    so no cross linking  no environmental interactions    and you break that down into a series of components. And then we embed elastic. And when I throw this up into the air and catch it  it has the full three dimensional structure of the protein  all of the intricacies. And this gives us a tangible model of the three dimensional protein and how it folds and all of the intricacies of the geometry. So we can study this as a physical  intuitive model. And we're also translating that into two dimensional systems    so flat sheets that can self fold into three dimensional structures. In three dimensions  we did a project last year at TEDGlobal with Autodesk and Arthur Olson where we looked at autonomous parts    so individual parts not pre connected that can come together on their own. And we built     of these glass beakers. They had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched. And we gave them away to all the TEDsters. And so these became intuitive models to understand how molecular self assembly works at the human scale. This is the polio virus. You shake it hard and it breaks apart. And then you shake it randomly and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own. And this is demonstrating that through random energy  we can build non random shapes. We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale. Last year at TED Long Beach  we built an installation that builds installations. The idea was  could we self assemble furniture scale objects  So we built a large rotating chamber  and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower  adding energy to the system and getting an intuitive understanding of how self assembly works and how we could use this as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products. So remember  I said  D. So today for the first time  we're unveiling a new project  which is a collaboration with Stratasys  and it's called  D printing. The idea behind  D printing is that you take multi material  D printing    so you can deposit multiple materials    and you add a new capability  which is transformation  that right off the bed  the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own. And this is like robotics without wires or motors. So you completely print this part  and it can transform into something else. We also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg. And this allows us to simulate this self assembly behavior and try to optimize which parts are folding when. But most importantly  we can use this same software for the design of nanoscale self assembly systems and human scale self assembly systems. These are parts being printed with multi material properties. Here's the first demonstration. A single strand dipped in water that completely self folds on its own into the letters M I T. I'm biased. This is another part  single strand  dipped in a bigger tank that self folds into a cube  a three dimensional structure  on its own. So no human interaction. And we think this is the first time that a program and transformation has been embedded directly into the materials themselves. And it also might just be the manufacturing technique that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future. So I know you're probably thinking  okay  that's cool  but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment  So I've started a lab at MIT  and it's called the Self Assembly Lab. And we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials for the built environment. And we think there's a few key sectors that have fairly near term applications. One of those is in extreme environments. These are scenarios where it's difficult to build  our current construction techniques don't work  it's too large  it's too dangerous  it's expensive  too many parts. And space is a great example of that. We're trying to design new scenarios for space that have fully reconfigurable and self assembly structures that can go from highly functional systems from one to another. Let's go back to infrastructure. In infrastructure  we're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec. And we're developing a new paradigm for piping. Imagine if water pipes could expand or contract to change capacity or change flow rate  or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves. So this isn't expensive pumps or valves. This is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own. So I want to remind you today of the harsh realities of assembly in our world. These are complex things built with complex parts that come together in complex ways. So I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world  how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale  so that we can go from a world like this to a world that's more like this. Thank you. In two weeks time  that's the ninth anniversary of the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed  Jeopardy  set. I mean  nine years is a long time. And given  Jeopardy's  average demographics  I think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead. But not all  a few are still alive. Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever. And when I do  it's as a bit of a know it all. I think that ship has sailed  it's too late for me. For better or for worse  that's what I'm going to be known as  as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff. And I can't complain about this. I feel like that was always sort of my destiny  although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet. If nothing else  you realize very quickly as a teenager  it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name. And as a result  I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know it all for many years. But if you go further back  if you look at it  it's all there. I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad with whatever great fact I had just read about    Haley's comet or giant squids or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was. I now have a    year old of my own who's exactly the same. And I know how deeply annoying it is  so karma does work. And I loved game shows  fascinated with game shows. I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in      because it had just hit me  as badly as I wanted to go to school  that I was also going to miss  Hollywood Squares  and  Family Feud.  I was going to miss my game shows. And later  in the mid '  s  when  Jeopardy  came back on the air  I remember running home from school every day to watch the show. It was my favorite show  even before it paid for my house. And we lived overseas  we lived in South Korea where my dad was working  where there was only one English language TV channel. There was Armed Forces TV  and if you didn't speak Korean  that's what you were watching. So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch  Jeopardy.  I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid. I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '  s and holding my own  back when that was a fad. There's a weird sense of mastery you get when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know. You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know. And you think  ah hah  knowledge really is power    the right fact deployed at exactly the right place. I never had a guidance counselor who thought this was a legitimate career path  that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex game show contestant. And so I sold out way too young. I didn't try to figure out what one does with that. I studied computers because I heard that was the thing  and I became a computer programmer    not an especially good one  not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on  Jeopardy  in     . But that's what I was doing. And it made it doubly ironic    my computer background    a few years later  I think      or so  when I got another phone call from  Jeopardy  saying   It's early days yet  but IBM tells us they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.' Are you up for this   This was the first I'd heard of it. And of course I said yes  for several reasons. One  because playing  Jeopardy  is a great time. It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on. And I would do it for nothing. I don't think they know that  luckily  but I would go back and play for Arby's coupons. I just love  Jeopardy   and I always have. And second of all  because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future. People playing computers on game shows was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future  and now I could be on the stage with it. I was not going to say no. The third reason I said yes is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win. I had taken some artificial intelligence classes. I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on  Jeopardy.  People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a  Jeopardy  clue in a natural language like English and understand all the double meanings  the puns  the red herrings  unpack the meaning of the clue. The kind of thing that a three  or four year old human  little kid could do  very hard for a computer. And I thought  well this is going to be child's play. Yes  I will come destroy the computer and defend my species. But as the years went on  as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this  I started to get occasional updates from them  and I started to get a little more worried. I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph. It was a scatter chart showing performance on  Jeopardy   tens of thousands of dots representing  Jeopardy  champions up at the top with their performance plotted on number of    I was going to say questions answered  but answers questioned  I guess  clues responded to    versus the accuracy of those answers. So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to. And at first  it was very low. There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena. But then you see the line start to go up. And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud. And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots  some black dots  that were a different color. And thought  what are these   The black dots in the upper right represent    time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings.  And I saw this line coming for me. And I realized  this is it. This is what it looks like when the future comes for you. It's not the Terminator's gun sight  it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do  the only thing that makes you special  the thing you're best at. And when the game eventually happened about a year later  it was very different than the  Jeopardy  games I'd been used to. We were not playing in L.A. on the regular  Jeopardy  set. Watson does not travel. Watson's actually huge. It's thousands of processors  a terabyte of memory  trillions of bytes of memory. We got to walk through his climate controlled server room. The only other  Jeopardy  contestant to this day I've ever been inside. And so Watson does not travel. You must come to it  you must make the pilgrimage. So me and the other human player wound up at this secret IBM research lab in the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County to play the computer. And we realized right away that the computer had a big home court advantage. There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage. Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls  and there's the thing in the middle of their court. And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers cheering on their little darling  having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up  and holding up  Go Watson  signs and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right. I think guys had  W A T S O N  written on their bellies in grease paint. If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters  W A T S O N  written on their gut  it's an unpleasant sight. But they were right. They were exactly right. I don't want to spoil it  if you still have this sitting on your DVR  but Watson won handily. And I remember standing there behind the podium as I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking. It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer. And you could hear that little tick  tick  tick  tick. And I remember thinking  this is it. I felt obsolete. I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '  s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line. I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers. And it hasn't been the last. If you watch the news  you'll see occasionally    and I see this all the time    that pharmacists now  there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist. And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions. You don't need human assistants for that anymore. I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score from a baseball or football game and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game and was commenting on it. And obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job as the humans they're replacing  but they're faster  and crucially  they're much  much cheaper. So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be. I've read economists saying that  as a result of these new technologies  we'll enter a new golden age of leisure when we'll all have time for the things we really love because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren. I've heard other people say quite the opposite  that this is yet another tier of the middle class that's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous  something that we should worry about. I'm not an economist myself. All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work. And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible. Here's the one thing that I was ever good at  and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do the same thing. They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV  and  I'm sorry  Ken. We don't need you anymore.  And it made me think  what does this mean  if we're going to be able to start outsourcing  not just lower unimportant brain functions. I'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers  when we knew our friends' phone numbers. And suddenly there was a machine that did that  and now we don't need to remember that anymore. I have read that there's now actually evidence that the hippocampus  the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships  physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like GPS  because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore. We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard. And as a result  a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff gets smaller and dumber. And it made me think  what happens when computers are now better at knowing and remembering stuff than we are  Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that  Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less  As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know  this was a terrifying idea to me. The more I thought about it  I realized  no  it's still important. The things we know are still important. I came to believe there were two advantages that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who says   Oh  yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second.  There's an advantage of volume  and there's an advantage of time. The advantage of volume  first  just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays. There's so much information out there. Being a Renaissance man or woman  that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance. Now it's really not possible to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor. There's just too much. They say that the scope of human information is now doubling every    months or so  the sum total of human information. That means between now and late       we will generate as much information  in terms of gigabytes  as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together. It's doubling every    months now. This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts. A decision like where do I go to school  What should I major in  Who do I vote for  Do I take this job or that one  These are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts. If we have those facts at our mental fingertips  we're going to be able to make informed decisions. If  on the other hand  we need to look them all up  we may be in trouble. According to a National Geographic survey I just saw  somewhere along the lines of    percent of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map. If you can't do that first step  are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy  Quite probably not. At some point you're just going to be like   You know what  There's too much to know. Screw it.  And you'll make a less informed decision. The other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips. I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith. She was a    year old girl from Surrey  England on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket  Thailand. She runs up to them on the beach one morning and says   Mom  Dad  we've got to get off the beach.  And they say   What do you mean  We just got here.  And she said   In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month  he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea and you see the waves churning way out there  that's the sign of a tsunami  and you need to clear the beach.  What would you do if your    year old daughter came up to you with this  Her parents thought about it  and they finally  to their credit  decided to believe her. They told the lifeguard  they went back to the hotel  and the lifeguard cleared over     people off the beach  luckily  because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami  the day after Christmas        that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean. But not on that beach  not on Mai Khao Beach  because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before. Now when facts come in handy like that    I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact  one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time    normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life. But in this case it happened in real life. And it happens in real life all the time. It's not always a tsunami  often it's a social situation. It's a meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge. You say where you're from  and I say   Oh  yeah.  Or your alma mater or your job  and I know just a little something about it  enough to get the ball rolling. People love that shared connection that gets created when somebody knows something about you. It's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met. That's often the advantage of time. And it's not effective if you say   Well  hold on. You're from Fargo  North Dakota. Let me see what comes up. Oh  yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo.  That doesn't work. That's just annoying. The great   th century British theologian and thinker  friend of Dr. Johnson  Samuel Parr once said   It's always better to know a thing than not to know it.  And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed  it's probably that. I have always believed that the things we know    that knowledge is an absolute good  that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are  as individuals and as a species. I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete. I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty  so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together. I don't want to be the last trivia know it all sitting on a mountain somewhere  reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of  Simpsons  episodes and the lyrics of Abba songs. I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices  to our search engines and our smartphones. In the movies  when computers like Watson start to think  things don't always end well. Those movies are never about beautiful utopias. It's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in      .  Things always go terribly wrong. And I feel like we're sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in. This is a question of leadership  because it becomes a question of who leads the future. On the one hand  we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it's ever been in human history  where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips. And on the other hand  we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore  that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud  and why would we ever bother learning anything new. Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in. And we can all make that choice. We make that choice by being curious  inquisitive people who like to learn  who don't just say   Well  as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over  I don't have to learn anymore   or  Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime. I don't have to learn new things anymore.  No  every day we should be striving to learn something new. We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us. That's where the people you see on  Jeopardy  come from. These know it alls  they're not Rainman style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book. I've met a lot of them. For the most part  they are just normal folks who are universally interested in the world around them  curious about everything  thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject. We can live in one of these two worlds. We can live in a world where our brains  the things that we know  continue to be the thing that makes us special  or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson. Ladies and gentlemen  the choice is yours. Thank you very much. So I'll be talking about the success of my campus  the University of Maryland  Baltimore County  UMBC  in educating students of all types  across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas. What makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder    students of color  students underrepresented in selected areas. And what makes the story especially unique is that we have learned how to help African American students  Latino students  students from low income backgrounds  to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering. And so I begin with a story about my childhood. We all are products of our childhood experiences. It's hard for me to believe that it's been    years since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham  Alabama  a kid who loved getting A's  a kid who loved math  who loved to read  a kid who would say to the teacher    when the teacher said   Here are    problems   to the class  this little fat kid would say   Give us    more.  And the whole class would say   Shut up  Freeman.  And there was a designated kicker every day. And so I was always asking this question   Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn   And amazingly  one week in church  when I really didn't want to be there and I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems  I heard this man say this   If we can get the children to participate in this peaceful demonstration here in Birmingham  we can show America that even children know the difference between right and wrong and that children really do want to get the best possible education.  And I looked up and said   Who is that man   And they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King. And I said to my parents   I've got to go. I want to go. I want to be a part of this.  And they said   Absolutely not.  And we had a rough go of it. And at that time  quite frankly  you really did not talk back to your parents. And somehow I said   You know  you guys are hypocrites. You make me go to this. You make me listen. The man wants me to go  and now you say no.  And they thought about it all night. And they came into my room the next morning. They had not slept. They had been literally crying and praying and thinking   Will we let our    year old participate in this march and probably have to go to jail   And they decided to do it. And when they came in to tell me  I was at first elated. And then all of a sudden I began thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses  and I got really scared  I really did. And one of the points I make to people all the time is that sometimes when people do things that are courageous  it doesn't really mean that they're that courageous. It simply means that they believe it's important to do it. I wanted a better education. I did not want to have to have hand me down books. I wanted to know that the school I attended not only had good teachers  but the resources we needed. And as a result of that experience  in the middle of the week  while I was there in jail  Dr. King came and said with our parents   What you children do this day will have an impact on children who have not been born.  I recently realized that two thirds of Americans today had not been born at the time of     . And so for them  when they hear about the Children's Crusade in Birmingham  in many ways  if they see it on TV  it's like our looking at the       Lincoln  movie  It's history. And the real question is  what lessons did we learn  Well amazingly  the most important for me was this  That children can be empowered to take ownership of their education. They can be taught to be passionate about wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking questions. And so it is especially significant that the university I now lead  the University of Maryland  Baltimore County  UMBC  was founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King  in     . And what made that institutional founding especially important is that Maryland is the South  as you know  and  quite frankly  it was the first university in our state founded at a time when students of all races could go there. And so we had black and white students and others who began to attend. And it has been for    years an experiment. The experiment is this  Is it possible to have institutions in our country  universities  where people from all backgrounds can come and learn and learn to work together and learn to become leaders and to support each other in that experience  Now what is especially important about that experience for me is this  We found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences. And so we began to work on that  for years in the '  s. And we produced a number of people in law  all the way to the humanities. We produced great artists. Beckett is our muse. A lot of our students get into theater. It's great work. The problem that we faced was the same problem America continues to face    that students in the sciences and engineering  black students were not succeeding. But when I looked at the data  what I found was that  quite frankly  students in general  large numbers were not making it. And as a result of that  we decided to do something that would help  first of all  the group at the bottom  African American students  and then Hispanic students. And Robert and Jane Meyerhoff  philanthropists  said   We'd like to help.  Robert Meyerhoff said   Why is it that everything I see on TV about black boys  if it's not about basketball  is not positive  I'd like to make a difference  to do something that's positive.  We married those ideas  and we created this Meyerhoff Scholars program. And what is significant about the program is that we learned a number of things. And the question is this  How is it that now we lead the country in producing African Americans who go on to complete Ph.D.'s in science and engineering and M.D. Ph.D.'s  That's a big deal. Give me a hand for that. That's a big deal. That's a big deal. It really is. You see  most people don't realize that it's not just minorities who don't do well in science and engineering. Quite frankly  you're talking about Americans. If you don't know it  while    percent of blacks and Hispanics who begin with a major in science and engineering will actually graduate in science and engineering  only    percent of whites who begin with majors in those areas actually succeed and graduate in those areas  and only    percent of Asian Americans. And so  the real question is  what is the challenge  Well a part of it  of course  is K   . We need to strengthen K   . But the other part has to do with the culture of science and engineering on our campuses. Whether you know it or not  large numbers of students with high SAT's and large numbers of A.P. credits who go to the most prestigious universities in our country begin in pre med or pre engineering and engineering  and they end up changing their majors. And the number one reason  we find  quite frankly  is they did not do well in first year science courses. In fact  we call first year science and engineering  typically around America  weed out courses or barrier courses. How many of you in this audience know somebody who started off in pre med or engineering and changed their major within a year or two  It's an American challenge. Half of you in the room. I know. I know. I know. And what is interesting about that is that so many students are smart and can do it. We need to find ways of making it happen. So what are the four things we did to help minority students that now are helping students in general  Number one  high expectations. It takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students    their grades  the rigor of the course work  their test taking skills  their attitude  the fire in their belly  the passion for the work  to make it. And so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position  very important. But equally important  it takes an understanding that it's hard work that makes the difference. I don't care how smart you are or how smart you think you are. Smart simply means you're ready to learn. You're excited about learning and you want to ask good questions. I. I. Rabi  a Nobel laureate  said that when he was growing up in New York  all of his friends' parents would ask them  What did you learn in school   at the end of a day. And he said  in contrast  his Jewish mother would say   Izzy  did you ask a good question today   And so high expectations have to do with curiosity and encouraging young people to be curious. And as a result of those high expectations  we began to find students we wanted to work with to see what could we do to help them  not simply to survive in science and engineering  but to become the very best  to excel. Interestingly enough  an example  One young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school  we said   We need to have you retake the course  because you need a strong foundation if you're going to move to the next level.  Every foundation makes the difference in the next level. He retook the course. That young man went on to graduate from UMBC  to become the first black to get the M.D. Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. He now works at Harvard. Nice story. Give him a hand for that too. Secondly  it's not about test scores only. Test scores are important  but they're not the most important thing. One young woman had great grades  but test scores were not as high. But she had a factor that was very important. She never missed a day of school  K   . There was fire in that belly. That young woman went on  and she is today with an M.D. Ph.D. from Hopkins. She's on the faculty  tenure track in psychiatry  Ph.D. in neuroscience. She and her adviser have a patent on a second use of Viagra for diabetes patients. Big hand for her. Big hand for her. And so high expectations  very important. Secondly  the idea of building community among the students. You all know that so often in science and engineering we tend to think cutthroat. Students are not taught to work in groups. And that's what we work to do with that group to get them to understand each other  to build trust among them  to support each other  to learn how to ask good questions  but also to learn how to explain concepts with clarity. As you know  it's one thing to earn an A yourself  it's another thing to help someone else do well. And so to feel that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world. So building community among those students  very important. Third  the idea of  it takes researchers to produce researchers. Whether you're talking about artists producing artists or you're talking about people getting into the social sciences  whatever the discipline    and especially in science and engineering  as in art  for example    you need scientists to pull the students into the work. And so our students are working in labs regularly. And one great example that you'll appreciate  During a snowstorm in Baltimore several years ago  the guy on our campus with this Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant literally came back to work in his lab after several days  and all these students had refused to leave the lab. They had food they had packed out. They were in the lab working  and they saw the work  not as schoolwork  but as their lives. They knew they were working on AIDS research. They were looking at this amazing protein design. And what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work. And he said   It doesn't get any better than that.  And then finally  if you've got the community and you've got the high expectations and you've got researchers producing researchers  you have to have people who are willing as faculty to get involved with those students  even in the classroom. I'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying   I've got this young man in class  a young black guy  and he seems like he's just not excited about the work. He's not taking notes. We need to talk to him.  What was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student to understand who was really involved and who was not and was saying   Let me see how I can work with them. Let me get the staff to help me out.  It was that connecting. That young man today is actually a faculty member M.D. Ph.D. in neuroengineering at Duke. Give him a big hand for that. And so the significance is that we have now developed this model that is helping us  not only finally with evaluation  assessing what works. And what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses. And so we redesigned chemistry  we redesigned physics. But now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences. Because so many students are bored in class. Do you know that  Many students  K    and in universities  don't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk. They need to be engaged. And so we have done    if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center  you'll see people coming from all over the country to look at how we are redesigning courses  having an emphasis on collaboration  use of technology  using problems out of our biotech companies on our campus  and not giving students the theories  but having them struggle with those theories. And it's working so well that throughout our university system in Maryland  more and more courses are being redesigned. It's called academic innovation. And what does all of that mean  It means that now  not just in science and engineering  we now have programs in the arts  in the humanities  in the social sciences  in teacher education  even particularly for women in I.T. If you don't know it  there's been a    percent decline in the number of women majoring in computer science just since     . And what I'm saying is that what will make the difference will be building community among students  telling young women  young minority students and students in general  you can do this work. And most important  giving them a chance to build that community with faculty pulling them into the work and our assessing what works and what does not work. Most important  if a student has a sense of self  it is amazing how the dreams and the values can make all the difference in the world. When I was a    year old child in the jail in Birmingham  I kept thinking   I wonder what my future could be.  I had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham to one day be president of a university that has students from     countries  where students are not there just to survive  where they love learning  where they enjoy being the best  where they will one day change the world. Aristotle said   Excellence is never an accident. It is the result of high intention  sincere effort and intelligent execution. It represents the wisest option among many alternatives.  And then he said something that gives me goosebumps. He said   Choice  not chance  determines your destiny.  Choice  not chance  determines your destiny  dreams and values. Thank you all very much. So just by a show of hands  how many of you all have a robot at home  Not very many of you. Okay. And actually of those hands  if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home  So a couple. That's okay. That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive    that I and the other    nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving. So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use  whether you're eight or   . And as it turns out  that's a really hard problem  because you have to build a small  portable robot that's not only really affordable  but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids. This robot can't be creepy or uncanny. He should be friendly and cute. So meet Romo. Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love    your iPhone    as his brain. And by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor  we can create a robot that is wi fi enabled and computer vision capable for     bucks  which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past. When Romo wakes up  he's in creature mode. So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face. If I duck down  he'll follow me. He's wary  so he'll keep his eyes on me. If I come over here  he'll turn to follow me. If I come over here     Laughs  He's smart. And if I get too close to him  he gets scared just like any other creature. So in a lot of ways  Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own. Thanks  little guy. Bless you. And if I want to explore the world    uh oh  Romo's tired    if I want to explore the world with Romo  I can actually connect him from any other iOS device. So here's the iPad. And Romo will actually stream video to this device. So I can see everything that Romo sees  and I get a robot's eye view of the world. Now this is a free app on the App Store  so if any of you guys had this app on your phones  we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together. So I'll show you really quickly  Romo actually    he's streaming video  so you can see me and the entire TED audience. If I get in front of Romo here. And if I want to control him  I can just drive. So I can drive him around  and I can take pictures of you. I've always wanted a picture of a       person TED audience. So I'll snap a picture. And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad  I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device. So there are all of you through Romo's eyes. And finally  because Romo is an extension of me  I can express myself through his emotions. So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited. But the most important thing about Romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive. You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo. In fact  who would like to drive a robot  Okay. Awesome. Here you go. Thank you  Scott. And even cooler  you actually don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him. So he actually streams two way audio and video between any two smart devices. So you can log in through the browser  and it's kind of like Skype on wheels. So we were talking before about telepresence  and this is a really cool example. You can imagine an eight year old girl  for example  who has an iPhone  and her mom buys her a robot. That girl can take her iPhone  put it on the robot  send an email to Grandma  who lives on the other side of the country. Grandma can log into that robot and play hide and go seek with her granddaughter for fifteen minutes every single night  when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year. Thanks  Scott. So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today. But I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future. This is actually something that one of our engineers  Dom  built in a weekend. It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly. This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want. You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo. And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser  which is what you see Romo doing on the left. And then if you have something you like  you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life  run the program in real life. And then if you have something you're proud of  you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world. So all of these wi fi enabled robots actually learn from each other. The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal. They change from person to person. So we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home  that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination. So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like. To be honest  I have no idea. But what we do know is that it isn't    years or    billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away. The future of personal robotics is happening today  and it's going to depend on small  agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves. So we can't wait to get you all robots  and we can't wait to see what you build. Thank you. I want to talk a little bit today about labor and work. When we think about how people work  the naive intuition we have is that people are like rats in a maze    that all people care about is money  and the moment we give them money  we can direct them to work one way  we can direct them to work another way. This is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways. And we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work  and what the labor market looks like. At the same time  if you think about it  there's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us. Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing. If you read books of people who climb mountains  difficult mountains  do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness  No  they are full of misery. In fact  it's all about frostbite and having difficulty walking  and difficulty breathing    cold  challenging circumstances. And if people were just trying to be happy  the moment they would get to the top  they would say   This was a terrible mistake. I'll never do it again.   Instead  let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos.  But instead  people go down  and after they recover  they go up again. And if you think about mountain climbing as an example  it suggests all kinds of things. It suggests that we care about reaching the end  a peak. It suggests that we care about the fight  about the challenge. It suggests that there's all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways. And for me personally  I started thinking about this after a student came to visit me. This was one of my students from a few years earlier  and he came one day back to campus. And he told me the following story  He said that for more than two weeks  he was working on a PowerPoint presentation. He was working in a big bank  and this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition. And he was working very hard on this presentation    graphs  tables  information. He stayed late at night every day. And the day before it was due  he sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss  and his boss wrote him back and said   Nice presentation  but the merger is canceled.  And the guy was deeply depressed. Now at the moment when he was working  he was actually quite happy. Every night he was enjoying his work  he was staying late  he was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation. But knowing that nobody would ever watch it made him quite depressed. So I started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor. And to start with  we created a little experiment in which we gave people Legos  and we asked them to build with Legos. And for some people  we gave them Legos and we said   Hey  would you like to build this Bionicle for three dollars  We'll pay you three dollars for it.  And people said yes  and they built with these Legos. And when they finished  we took it  we put it under the table  and we said   Would you like to build another one  this time for   .     If they said yes  we gave them another one  and when they finished  we asked them   Do you want to build another one   for   .      .    and so on  until at some point people said   No more. It's not worth it for me.  This was what we called the meaningful condition. People built one Bionicle after another. After they finished every one of them  we put them under the table. And we told them that at the end of the experiment  we will take all these Bionicles  we will disassemble them  we will put them back in the boxes  and we will use it for the next participant. There was another condition. This other condition was inspired by David  my student. And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition. And if you remember the story about Sisyphus  Sisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill  and when he almost got to the end  the rock would roll over  and he would have to start again. And you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work. You can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills  at least he would have some sense of progress. Also  if you look at prison movies  sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole  and when the prisoner is finished  they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again. There's something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating. So in the second condition of this experiment  that's exactly what we did. We asked people   Would you like to build one Bionicle for three dollars   And if they said yes  they built it. Then we asked them   Do you want to build another one for   .     And if they said yes  we gave them a new one  and as they were building it  we took apart the one that they just finished. And when they finished that  we said   Would you like to build another one  this time for    cents less   And if they said yes  we gave them the one that they built and we broke. So this was an endless cycle of them building  and us destroying in front of their eyes. Now what happens when you compare these two conditions  The first thing that happened was that people built many more Bionicles    eleven in the meaningful condition  versus seven in the Sisyphus condition. And by the way  we should point out that this was not big meaning. People were not curing cancer or building bridges. People were building Bionicles for a few cents. And not only that  everybody knew that the Bionicles would be destroyed quite soon. So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning. But even the small meaning made a difference. Now we had another version of this experiment. In this other version of the experiment  we didn't put people in this situation  we just described to them the situation  much as I am describing to you now  and we asked them to predict what the result would be. What happened  People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude. People who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition  people would probably build one more Bionicle. So people understand that meaning is important  they just don't understand the magnitude of the importance  the extent to which it's important. There was one other piece of data we looked at. If you think about it  there are some people who love Legos  and some people who don't. And you would speculate that the people who love Legos would build more Legos  even for less money  because after all  they get more internal joy from it. And the people who love Legos less would build less Legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower. And that's actually what we found in the meaningful condition. There was a very nice correlation between the love of Legos and the amount of Legos people built. What happened in the Sisyphic condition  In that condition  the correlation was zero    there was no relationship between the love of Legos  and how much people built  which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people's eyes  we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity. We basically eliminated it. Soon after I finished running this experiment  I went to talk to a big software company in Seattle. I can't tell you who they were  but they were a big company in Seattle. This was a group within the software company that was put in a different building  and they asked them to innovate  and create the next big product for this company. And the week before I showed up  the CEO of this big software company went to that group      engineers  and canceled the project. And I stood there in front of     of the most depressed people I've ever talked to. And I described to them some of these Lego experiments  and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment. And I asked them  I said   How many of you now show up to work later than you used to   And everybody raised their hand. I said   How many of you now go home earlier than you used to   Everybody raised their hand. I asked them   How many of you now add not so kosher things to your expense reports   And they didn't raise their hands  but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports. And then I asked them  I said   What could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed   And they came up with all kinds of ideas. They said the CEO could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do. He could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization. He could have asked them to build some next generation prototypes  and see how they would work. But the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation. And I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning. If the CEO  just like our participants  thought the essence of meaning is unimportant  then he  wouldn't  care. And he would say   At the moment I directed you in this way  and now that I'm directing you in this way  everything will be okay.  But if you understood how important meaning is  then you would figure out that it's actually important to spend some time  energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they're doing. The next experiment was slightly different. We took a sheet of paper with random letters  and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other. That was the task. People did the first sheet  then we asked if they wanted to do another for a little less money  the next sheet for a little bit less  and so on and so forth. And we had three conditions. In the first condition  people wrote their name on the sheet  found all the pairs of letters  gave it to the experimenter  the experimenter would look at it  scan it from top to bottom  say  Uh huh   and put it on the pile next to them. In the second condition  people did not write their name on it. The experimenter looked at it  took the sheet of paper  did not look at it  did not scan it  and simply put it on the pile of pages. So you take a piece  you just put it on the side. In the third condition  the experimenter got the sheet of paper  and put it directly into a shredder. What happened in those three conditions  In this plot I'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped. So low numbers mean that people worked harder. They worked for much longer. In the acknowledged condition  people worked all the way down to    cents. At    cents per page  they basically stopped these efforts. In the shredder condition  it was twice as much       cents per sheet. And this is basically the result we had before. You shred people's efforts  output    you get them not to be as happy with what they're doing. But I should point out  by the way  that in the shredder condition  people could have cheated. They could have done not so good work  because they realized people were just shredding it. So maybe the first sheet you'd do good work  but then you see nobody is really testing it  so you would do more and more and more. So in fact  in the shredder condition  people could have submitted more work and gotten more money  and put less effort into it. But what about the ignored condition  Would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder  or somewhere in the middle  It turns out it was almost like the shredder. Now there's good news and bad news here. The bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes. Ignoring gets you a whole way out there. The good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done  scanning it and saying  Uh huh   that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people's motivations. So the good news is that adding motivation doesn't seem to be so difficult. The bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy  and if we don't think about it carefully  we might overdo it. So this is all in terms of negative motivation  or eliminating negative motivation. The next part I want to show you is something about positive motivation. So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA. And IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble. I don't know about you  but every time I assemble one of those  it takes me much longer  it's much more effortful  it's much more confusing  I put things in the wrong way    I can't say I enjoy those pieces. I can't say I enjoy the process. But when I finish it  I seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture more than I like other ones. And there's an old story about cake mixes. So when they started cake mixes in the '  s  they would take this powder and they would put it in a box  and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in  stir some water in it  mix it  put it in the oven  and    voila    you had cake. But it turns out they were very unpopular. People did not want them  and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that. Maybe the taste was not good  No  the taste was great. What they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved. It was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say   Here is my cake.  No  it was somebody else's cake  as if you bought it in the store. It didn't really feel like your own. So what did they do  They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder. Now you had to break the eggs and add them  you had to measure the milk and add it  mixing it. Now it was your cake. Now everything was fine. Now  I think a little bit like the IKEA effect  by getting people to work harder  they actually got them to love what they're doing to a higher degree. So how do we look at this question experimentally  We asked people to build some origami. We gave them instructions on how to create origami  and we gave them a sheet of paper. And these were all novices  and they built something that was really quite ugly    nothing like a frog or a crane. But then we told them   Look  this origami really belongs to us. You worked for us  but I'll tell you what  we'll sell it to you. How much do you want to pay for it   And we measured how much they were willing to pay for it. And we had two types of people  We had the people who built it  and the people who did not build it  and just looked at it as external observers. And what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami    and they were willing to pay five times more for them than the people who just evaluated them externally. Now you could say    if you were a builder  do you think  you'd say    Oh  I love this origami  but I know that nobody else would love it   Or  I love this origami  and everybody else will love it as well   Which one of those two is correct  Turns out the builders not only loved the origami more  they thought that everybody would see the world in their view. They thought everybody else would love it more as well. In the next version  we tried to do the IKEA effect. We tried to make it more difficult. So for some people  we gave the same task. For some people  we made it harder by hiding the instructions. At the top of the sheet  we had little diagrams of how you fold origami. For some people  we just eliminated that. So now this was tougher. What happened  Well in an objective way  the origami now was uglier  it was more difficult. Now when we looked at the easy origami  we saw the same thing    builders loved it more  evaluators loved it less. When you looked at the hard instructions  the effect was larger. Why  Because now the builders loved it even more. They put all this extra effort into it. And evaluators  They loved it even less. Because in reality  it was even uglier than the first version. Of course  this tells you something about how we evaluate things. Now think about kids. Imagine I asked you   How much would you sell your kids for   Your memories and associations and so on. Most people would say for a lot  a lot of money. On good days. But imagine this was slightly different. Imagine if you did not have your kids. And one day you went to the park and you met some kids. They were just like your kids  and you played with them for a few hours  and when you were about to leave  the parents said   Hey  by the way  just before you leave  if you're interested  they're for sale.  How much would you pay for them now  Most people say not that much. And this is because our kids are so valuable  not just because of who they are  but because of us  because they are so connected to us  and because of the time and connection. By the way  if you think IKEA instructions are not good  what about the instructions that come with kids  those are really tough. By the way  these are my kids  which  of course  are wonderful and so on. Which comes to tell you one more thing  which is  much like our builders  when they look at the creature of their creation  we don't see that other people don't see things our way. Let me say one last comment. If you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx  Adam Smith had a very important notion of efficiency. He gave an example of a pin factory. He said pins have    different steps  and if one person does all    steps  production is very low. But if you get one person to do step one  and one person to do step two and step three and so on  production can increase tremendously. And indeed  this is a great example  and the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency. Karl Marx  on the other hand  said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing. And if you do all    steps  you care about the pin. But if you do one step every time  maybe you don't care as much. I think that in the Industrial Revolution  Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx. But the reality is that we've switched  and now we're in the knowledge economy. You can ask yourself  what happens in a knowledge economy  Is efficiency still more important than meaning  I think the answer is no. I think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort  attention  caring  how connected they feel to it  are they thinking about labor on the way to work  and in the shower and so on  all of a sudden Marx has more things to say to us. So when we think about labor  we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing  but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it    meaning  creation  challenges  ownership  identity  pride  etc. The good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them    how do we create our own meaning  pride  motivation  and how do we do it in our workplace  and for the employees    I think we could get people to be both more productive and happier. Thank you very much. I want to share some personal friends and stories with you that I've actually never talked about in public before to help illustrate the idea and the need and the hope for us to reinvent our health care system around the world. Twenty four years ago  I had    a sophomore in college  I had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved. And I ended up in student health  and they ran some labwork and came back right away  and said   Kidney problems.  And before I knew it  I was involved and thrown into this six months of tests and trials and tribulations with six doctors across two hospitals in this clash of medical titans to figure out which one of them was right about what was wrong with me. And I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound  and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once  and I'm like   Uh oh  this is bad news.  And their diagnosis was this  They said   You have two rare kidney diseases that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually  you have cancer like cells in your immune system that we need to start treatment right away  and you'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant  and you're not likely to live more than two or three years.  Now  with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis  it just sucked me in immediately  as if I began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me  until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room  who became a dear friend  and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases  and said   Eric  these people who get this are normally in their '  s and '  s. They don't know anything about you. Wake up. Take control of your health and get on with your life.  And I did. Now  these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people. In fact  these professionals were miracle workers  but they're working in a flawed  expensive system that's set up the wrong way. It's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need. It's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us. It's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails  and so something either works or you die. And it's dependent on passive patients who just take it and don't ask any questions. Now the problem with this model is that it's unsustainable globally. It's unaffordable globally. We need to invent what I call a personal health system. So what does this personal health system look like  and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail  Now  I'm going to start by actually sharing with you a new friend of mine  Libby  somebody I've become quite attached to over the last six months. This is Libby  or actually  this is an ultrasound image of Libby. This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have. Now  this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today  and you'll notice  on the edge of this image  there's some dark spots there  which was really concerning to me. So we're going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how Libby's doing. This is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here. Don't you in the front row worry or anything. I'm going to use a device from a company called Mobisante. This is a portable ultrasound. It can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet. Mobisante is up in Redmond  Washington  and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself. They're not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this. This is a concept demo  so I want to make that clear. All right  I gotta gel up. Now the people in the front row are very nervous.  Laughter  And I want to actually introduce you to Dr. Batiuk  who's another friend of mine. He's up in Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland  Oregon. So let me just make sure. Hey  Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay  And actually  can you see Libby  Thomas Batuik  Hi there  Eric. You look busy. How are you  Eric Dishman  I'm good. I'm just taking my clothes off in front of a few hundred people. It's wonderful. So I just wanted to see  is this the image you need to get  And I know you want to look and see if those spots are still there. TB  Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here  give me a lay of the land. ED  All right.TB  Okay. Turn it a little bit inside  a little bit toward the middle for me. Okay  that's good. How about up a little bit  Okay  freeze that image. That's a good one for me. ED  All right. Now last week  when I did this  you had me measure that spot to the right. Should I do that again  TB  Yeah  let's do that. ED  All right. This is kind of hard to do with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring  but I've got it  I think  and I'll save that image and send it to you. So tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means. It's not something I was very happy about. TB  Many people after a kidney transplant will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney. Most of the time it doesn't create any kind of mischief  but it does warrant looking at  so I'm happy we've got an opportunity to look at it today  make sure that it's not growing  it's not creating any problems. Based on the other images we have  I'm really happy how it looks today. ED  All right. Well  I guess we'll double check it when I come in. I've got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks  and I'm going to let you do that in the clinic  because I don't think I can do that one on myself. TB  Good choice.ED  All right  thanks  Dr. Batiuk. All right. So what you're sort of seeing here is an example of disruptive technologies  of mobile  social and analytic technologies. These are the foundations of what's going to make personal health possible. Now there's really three pillars of this personal health I want to talk to you about now  and it's care anywhere  care networking and care customization. And you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with Dr. Batiuk. So let's start with care anywhere. Humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics in the     s. It is time to update our thinking. We have got to untether clinicians and patients from the notion of traveling to a special bricks and mortar place for all of our care  because these places are often the wrong tool  and the most expensive tool  for the job. And these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients  especially in an era of superbugs and hospital acquired infections. And many countries are going to go brickless from the start because they're never going to be able to afford the mega medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built. Now I personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age. This was me in third grade. I broke my elbow very seriously  had to have surgery  worried that they were going to actually lose the arm. Recovering from the surgery in the hospital  I get bedsores. Those bedsores become infected  and they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to  and now my whole body breaks out  and now all of those become infected. The longer I stayed in the hospital  the sicker I became  and the more expensive it became  and this happens to millions of people around the world every year. The future of personal health that I'm talking about says care must occur at home as the default model  not in a hospital or clinic. You have to earn your way into those places by being sick enough to use that tool for the job. Now the smartphones that we're already carrying can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them  and a whole array of others  today  and as sensing is built into these  we'll be able to do vital signs monitor and behavioral monitoring like we've never had before. Many of us will have implantables that will actually look real time at what's going on with our blood chemistry and in our proteins right now. Now the software is also getting smarter  right  Think about a coach  an agent online  that's going to help me do safe self care. That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound will likely have real time image processing  and the device will say   Up  down  left  right  ah  Eric  that's the perfect spot to send that image off to your doctor.  Now  if we've got all these networked devices that are helping us to do care anywhere  it stands to reason that we also need a team to be able to interact with all of that stuff  and that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about  care networking. We have got to go beyond this paradigm of isolated specialists doing parts care to multidisciplinary teams doing person care. Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best  and it is deadly at worst. Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members. I had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school  when we're under treatment for the kidney  and suddenly  they're like   Oh  we think you have a heart problem.  And I have these palpitations that are showing up. They put me through five weeks of tests    very expensive  very scary    before the nurse finally notices the piece of the paper  my meds list that I've been carrying to every single appointment  and says   Oh my gosh.  Three different specialists had prescribed three different versions of the same drug to me. I did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem. I had a care coordination problem. And this happens to millions of people every year. I want to use technology that we're all working on and making happen to make health care a coordinated team sport. Now this is the most frightening thing to me. Out of all the care I've had in hospitals and clinics around the world  the first time I've ever had a true team based care experience was at Legacy Good Sam these last six months for me to go get this. And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy. There's a couple of the folks here. You'll recognize Dr. Batiuk. We just talked to him. Here's Jenny  one of the nurses  Allison  who helped manage the transplant list  and a dozen other people who aren't pictured  a pharmacist  a psychologist  a nutritionist  even a financial counselor  Lisa  who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles. I wept the day I graduated. I should have been happy  because I was so well that I could go back to my normal doctors  but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team. And here's the most important part. The other people in this picture are me and my wife  Ashley. Legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics. That's the only way that the model works. My team is actually working in China on one of these self care models for a project we called Age Friendly Cities. We're trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors caring for themselves as well as the care provided by their family members or volunteer community health workers  as well as have an exchange network online  where  for example  I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom  if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals  and we exchange all of that online. The most important point I want to make to you about this is the sacred and somewhat over romanticized doctor patient one on one is a relic of the past. The future of health care is smart teams  and you'd better be on that team for yourself. Now  the last thing that I want to talk to you about is care customization  because if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking  those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system  but there's still too much guesswork. Randomized clinical trials were actually invented in      to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis  and those are important things  don't get me wrong. These population studies that we've done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives  but the problem is that health care is treating us as averages  not unique individuals  because at the end of the day  the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied. That's what's leading to the guesswork. The technologies that are coming  high performance computing  analytics  big data that everyone's talking about  will allow us to build predictive models for each of us as individual patients. And the magic here is  experiment on my avatar in software  not my body in suffering. Now  I've had two examples I want to quickly share with you of this kind of care customization on my own journey. The first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity. It's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live. I was optimizing my life for quality of life  and quality of life for me means time in snow. So on my chart  I forced them to put   Patient goal  low doses of drugs over longer periods of time  side effects friendly to skiing.  And I think that's why I achieved longevity. I think that time in snow therapy was as important as the pharmaceuticals that I had. Now the second example of customization    and by the way  you can't customize care if you don't know your own goals  so health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals. But the second example I want to give you is  I happened to be an early guinea pig  and I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced. Now it took about two weeks of processing on Intel's highest end servers to make this happen  and another six months of human and computing labor to make sense of all of that data. And at the end of all of that  they said   Yes  those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans all of those years ago were wrong  and we have a better path forward.  The future that Intel's working on now is to figure out how to make that computing for personalized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours  and make this kind of tool available  not just in the mainframes of tier one research hospitals around the world  but in the mainstream    every patient  every clinic with access to whole genome sequencing. And I tell you  this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime. So these three pillars of personal health  care anywhere  care networking  care customization  are happening in pieces now  but this vision will completely fail if we don't step up as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles. It's what my friend Verna said  Wake up and take control of your health. Because at the end of the day these technologies are simply about people caring for other people and ourselves in some powerful new ways. And it's in that spirit that I want to introduce you to one last friend  very quickly. Tracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney that I was never supposed to have. So Tracey  just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you. Tracey Gamley  For me  it was really easy. I only had one night in the hospital. The surgery was done laparoscopically  so I have just five very small scars on my abdomen  and I had four weeks away from work and went back to doing everything I'd done before without any changes. ED  Well  I probably will never get a chance to say this to you in such a large audience ever again. So  thank you  feel likes a really trite word  but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life. This TED stage and all of the TED stages are often about celebrating innovation and celebrating new technologies  and I've done that here today  and I've seen amazing things coming from TED speakers  I mean  my gosh  artificial kidneys  even printable kidneys  that are coming. But until such time that these amazing technologies are available to all of us  and even when they are  it's up to us to care for  and even save  one another. I hope you will go out and make personal health happen for yourselves and for everyone. Thanks so much. I'd like you to come back with me for a moment to the   th century  specifically to June         . The British Association for the Advancement of Science is holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge. It's the first night of the meeting  and a confrontation is about to take place that will change science forever. An elderly  white haired man stands up. The members of the Association are shocked to realize that it's the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge  who hadn't even left his house in years until that day. They're even more shocked by what he says.  You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers.  Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs. They were not mucking around in the fossil pits or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles like the members of the British Association. The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly. A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up and quieted the audience. He politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association did not exist.  If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term   he said   then  by analogy with 'artist ' we may form 'scientist.'  This was the first time the word scientist was uttered in public  only     years ago. I first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school  and it kind of blew me away. I mean  how could the word scientist not have existed until       What were scientists called before  What had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment  Prior to this meeting  those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs. Think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils  like Charles Darwin  for example  or  the hired help of a nobleman  like Joseph Priestley  who was the literary companion to the Marquis of Lansdowne when he discovered oxygen. After this  they were scientists  professionals with a particular scientific method  goals  societies and funding. Much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at Cambridge University in       Charles Babbage  John Herschel  Richard Jones and William Whewell. These were brilliant  driven men who accomplished amazing things. Charles Babbage  I think known to most TEDsters  invented the first mechanical calculator and the first prototype of a modern computer. John Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere  and  in his spare time  co invented photography. I'm sure we could all be that productive without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time. Richard Jones became an important economist who later influenced Karl Marx. And Whewell not only coined the term scientist  as well as the words anode  cathode and ion  but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides. In the Cambridge winter of      and       the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts. They talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution. They felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the   th century. It was time for a new revolution  which they pledged to bring about  and what's so amazing about these guys is  not only did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams  but they actually carried them out  even beyond their wildest dreams. And I'm going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made. About     years before  Francis Bacon and then  later  Isaac Newton  had proposed an inductive scientific method. Now that's a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws  which are always subject to revision or rejection should new evidence arise. However  in       David Ricardo muddied the waters by arguing that the science of economics should use a different  deductive method. The problem was that an influential group at Oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics  this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too. The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed. They wrote books and articles promoting inductive method in all the sciences that were widely read by natural philosophers  university students and members of the public. Reading one of Herschel's books was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin that he would later say   Scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me. It made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge.  It also shaped Darwin's scientific method  as well as that used by his peers.  Science for the public good  Previously  it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen  or for one's own personal gain. For example  ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports. Harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains. The philosophical breakfast club changed that  working together. Whewell's worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge to all ship captains. Herschel helped by making tidal observations off the coast of South Africa  and  as he complained to Whewell  he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble. The four men really helped each other in every way. They also relentlessly lobbied the British government for the money to build Babbage's engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society. In the days before pocket calculators  the numbers that most professionals needed    bankers  insurance agents  ship captains  engineers   were to be found in lookup books like this  filled with tables of figures. These tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part time workers known as    and this is amazing    computers  but these calculations were really difficult. I mean  this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year. Each month required       calculations  so these tables were filled with mistakes. Babbage's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator devised to accurately compute any of these tables. Two models of his engine were built in the last    years by a team from the Science Museum of London using his own plans. This is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California  and it calculates accurately. It actually works. Later  Babbage's analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense. It had a separate memory and central processor. It was capable of iteration  conditional branching and parallel processing  and it was programmable using punched cards  an idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom. Tragically  Babbage's engines never were built in his day because most people thought that non human computers would have no usefulness for the public.  New scientific institutions  Founded in Bacon's time  the Royal Society of London was the foremost scientific society in England and even in the rest of the world. By the   th century  it had become a kind of gentleman's club populated mainly by antiquarians  literary men and the nobility. The members of the philosophical breakfast club helped form a number of new scientific societies  including the British Association. These new societies required that members be active researchers publishing their results. They reinstated the tradition of the Q A after scientific papers were read  which had been discontinued by the Royal Society as being ungentlemanly. And for the first time  they gave women a foot in the door of science. Members were encouraged to bring their wives  daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association  and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one  they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well. The British Association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members.  External funding for science  Up to the   th century  natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies. Occasionally  there were prizes  such as that given to John Harrison in the   th century  for solving the so called longitude problem  but prizes were only given after the fact  when they were given at all. On the advice of the philosophical breakfast club  the British Association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy  the tides  fossil fish  shipbuilding  and many other areas. These grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research  but they also encouraged thinking outside the box  rather than just trying to solve one pre set question. Eventually  the Royal Society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit  and this has become    fortunately it's become    a major part of the scientific landscape today. So the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist. That's the heroic part of their story. There's a flip side as well. They did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution. They would have been deeply dismayed by today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture. It's shocking to realize that only    percent of American adults have even a very basic level of science literacy  and this was tested by asking simple questions like   Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time   and  What proportion of the Earth is covered in water   Once scientists became members of a professional group  they were slowly walled off from the rest of us. This is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends. Charles Darwin said   I sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work.  In fact   Origin of Species  was written for a general and popular audience  and was widely read when it first appeared. Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten  that science is not only for scientists. Thank you. Let's talk dirty. A few years ago  oddly enough  I needed the bathroom  and I found one  a public bathroom  and I went into the stall  and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life  use the toilet  flush the toilet  forget about the toilet. And for some reason that day  instead  I asked myself a question  and it was  where does this stuff go  And with that question  I found myself plunged into the world of sanitation    there's more coming     Laughter    sanitation  toilets and poop  and I have yet to emerge. And that's because it's such an enraging  yet engaging place to be. To go back to that toilet  it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet  it wasn't as nice as this one from the World Toilet Organization. That's the other WTO.  Laughter  But it had a lockable door  it had privacy  it had water  it had soap so I could wash my hands  and I did because I'm a woman  and we do that. But that day  when I asked that question  I learned something  and that was that I'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right  when in fact it's a privilege.  .  billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet. They don't have a bucket or a box. Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet. And they have to do what this little boy is doing by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway  which is called open defecation  or poo pooing in the open. And he does that every day  and every day  probably  that guy in the picture walks on by  because he sees that little boy  but he doesn't see him. But he should  because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers. Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit. All those things  the eggs  the cysts  the bacteria  the viruses  all those can travel in one gram of human feces. How  Well  that little boy will not have washed his hands. He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house  and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet. In what I call the flushed and plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in  the most common symptoms associated with those diseases  diarrhea  is now a bit of a joke. It's the runs  the Hershey squirts  the squits. Where I come from  we call it Delhi belly  as a legacy of empire. But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency  this is the picture that you come up with. Still not sure about the bikini. And here's another image of diarrhea. This is Marie Saylee  nine months old. You can't see her  because she's buried under that green grass in a little village in Liberia  because she died in three days from diarrhea    the Hershey squirts  the runs  a joke. And that's her dad. But she wasn't alone that day  because       other children died of diarrhea  and they do every day. Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide  and you've probably been asked to care about things like HIV AIDS or T.B. or measles  but diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together. It's a very potent weapon of mass destruction. And the cost to the world is immense      billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation. These are cholera beds in Haiti. You'll have heard of cholera  but we don't hear about diarrhea. It gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases. But we know how to fix this. We know  because in the mid   th century  wonderful Victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet  and disease dropped dramatically. Child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history. The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last     years by the readers of the British Medical Journal  and they were choosing over the Pill  anesthesia  and surgery. It's a wonderful waste disposal device. But I think that it's so good   it doesn't smell  we can put it in our house  we can lock it behind a door   and I think we've locked it out of conversation too. We don't have a neutral word for it. Poop's not particularly adequate. Shit offends people. Feces is too medical. Because I can't explain otherwise  when I look at the figures  what's going on. We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation  but if you look at the budgets of countries  developing and developed  you'll think there's something wrong with the math  because you'll expect absurdities like Pakistan spending    times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation  even though         children die of diarrhea in Pakistan every year. But then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget  and    to    percent of it will go on clean water supply  which is great  we all need water. No one's going to refuse clean water. But the humble latrine  or flush toilet  reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water. Think about it. That little boy who's running back into his house  he may have a nice  clean fresh water supply  but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with. And I think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development  because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us. So a toilet can put a girl back in school. Twenty five percent of girls in India drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation. They've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in. We've all done that  but they do it every day  and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating  it just gets too much. And I understand that. Who can blame them  So if you met an educationalist and said   I can improve education attendance rates by    percent with just one simple thing   you'd make a lot of friends in education. That's not the only thing it can do for you. Poop can cook your dinner. It's got nutrients in it. We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well. We don't keep them all. In Rwanda  they are now getting    percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners' bowels. So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare. They're genocidal inmates  most of them  and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines  because if you put poop in a sealed environment  in a tank  pretty much like a stomach  then  pretty much like a stomach  it gives off gas  and you can cook with it. And you might think it's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit  but it's also good economic sense  because they're saving a million dollars a year. They're cutting down on deforestation  and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible  infinite and free at the point of production. It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives. Here's a woman who's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes  which is what you think it is  except not quite  because it's actually donated. There is now a new career path called stool donor. It's like the new sperm donor. Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff  and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases. She's been suffering for years. She gets a dose of healthy human feces  and the cure rate for this procedure is    percent. It's astonishing  but hardly anyone is still doing it. Maybe it's the ick factor. That's okay  because there's a team of research scientists in Canada who have now created a stool sample  a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate. So you'd be thinking by now  okay  the solution's simple  we give everyone a toilet. And this is where it gets really interesting  because it's not that simple  because we are not simple. So the really interesting  exciting work    this is the engaging bit    in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology. We need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware. They've found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they've got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground. So the idea is to manipulate human emotion. It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it in the early   th century. They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it. They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it. In India now there's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don't have a toilet. It's called  No Loo  No I Do.  And in case you think that poster's just propaganda  here's Priyanka     years old. I met her last October in India  and she grew up in a conservative environment. She grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India  and she was engaged at     and then at    or so  she moved into her in law's house. And she was horrified to get there and find that they didn't have a toilet. She'd grown up with a latrine. It was no big deal  but it was a latrine. And the first night she was there  she was told that at   o'clock in the morning    her mother in law got her up  told her to go outside and go and do it in the dark in the open. And she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around. She was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape. After three days  she did an unthinkable thing. She left. And if you know anything about rural India  you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do. But not just that. She got her toilet  and now she goes around all the other villages in India persuading other women to do the same thing. It's what I call social contagion  and it's really powerful and really exciting. Another version of this  another village in India near where Priyanka lives is this village  called Lakara  and about a year ago  it had no toilets whatsoever. Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera. Some visitors came  using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other. Somehow  people who'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought   Oops.  Not only that  but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit. That's what really made them change their behavior. So this woman  this boy's mother installed this latrine in a few hours. Her entire life  she'd been using the banana field behind  but she installed the latrine in a few hours. It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life. So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation  even though these are pretty exciting times because we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation reinventing the toilet  which is great  we've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike  which is great for humanity  very bad for his colon. But there are things to worry about. It's the most off track Millennium Development Goal. It's about    or so years off track. We're not going to meet targets  providing people with sanitation at this rate. So when I get sad about sanitation  I think of Japan  because Japan    years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks  and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos  washlet toilets. They have in built bidet nozzles for a lovely  hands free cleaning experience  and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid raising device which is known as the  marriage saver.  But most importantly  what they have done in Japan  which I find so inspirational  is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door. They've made it conversational. People go out and upgrade their toilet. They talk about it. They've sanitized it. I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do. All we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent  shameful issue that it is. And don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong. Our sewers are crumbling. Things are going wrong here too. The solution to all of this is pretty easy. I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing  and that's to go out  protest  speak about the unspeakable  and talk shit. Thank you. So let's start with some good news  and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases  Let's start with leukemia  acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL  the most common cancer of children. When I was a student  the mortality rate was about    percent. Today  some        years later  we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by    percent. Six thousand children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured. If you want the really big numbers  look at these numbers for heart disease. Heart disease used to be the biggest killer  particularly for men in their   s. Today  we've seen a    percent reduction in mortality from heart disease    remarkably   .  million deaths averted every year. AIDS  incredibly  has just been named  in the past month  a chronic disease  meaning that a    year old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks  months  or a couple of years  as we said only a decade ago  but is thought to live decades  probably to die in his '  s or '  s from other causes altogether. These are just remarkable  remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers. And one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about  stroke  which has been  along with heart disease  one of the biggest killers in this country  is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within three hours of the onset  some    percent of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever. Remarkable stories  good news stories  all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early. Early detection  early intervention  that's the story for these successes. Unfortunately  the news is not all good. Let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide. Now this is  of course  not a disease  per se. It's a condition  or it's a situation that leads to mortality. What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is. There are        suicides each year in the United States. That means one about every    minutes. Third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of    and   . It's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country. Now  when we talk about suicide  there is also a medical contribution here  because    percent of suicides are related to a mental illness  depression  bipolar disorder  schizophrenia  anorexia  borderline personality. There's a long list of disorders that contribute  and as I mentioned before  often early in life. But it's not just the mortality from these disorders. It's also morbidity. If you look at disability  as measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years  it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist  except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes  and as you can see  virtually    percent of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders  neuropsychiatric syndromes. You're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense. I mean  cancer seems far more serious. Heart disease seems far more serious. But you can see actually they are further down this list  and that's because we're talking here about disability. What drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression  Why are they number one here  Well  there are probably three reasons. One is that they're highly prevalent. About one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime. A second  of course  is that  for some people  these become truly disabling  and it's about four to five percent  perhaps one in   . But what really drives these numbers  this high morbidity  and to some extent the high mortality  is the fact that these start very early in life. Fifty percent will have onset by age        percent by age     a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease  diabetes  hypertension    most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality. These are  indeed  the chronic disorders of young people. Now  I started by telling you that there were some good news stories. This is obviously not one of them. This is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult  and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me. My job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders. I work for the federal government. Actually  I work for you. You pay my salary. And maybe at this point  when you know what I do  or maybe what I've failed to do  you'll think that I probably ought to be fired  and I could certainly understand that. But what I want to suggest  and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these illnesses. What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders  diseases of the mind. That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days  and people feel that  for whatever reason  it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior. Fair enough. They are disorders of behavior  and they are disorders of the mind. But what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms  which have been in play for a century or more  are actually now impediments to progress  that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders. Now  for some of you  you're going to say   Oh my goodness  here we go again. We're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules  or maybe into some sort of very flat  unidimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia. When we talk about the brain  it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic. It depends  of course  on what scale or what scope you want to think about  but this is an organ of surreal complexity  and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it  whether you're thinking about the     billion neurons that are in the cortex or the     trillion synapses that make up all the connections. We have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports our own minds. It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself. In a sense  it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition  something you can observe  that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex  mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand. Now  already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about  depression  obsessive compulsive disorder  post traumatic stress disorder  while we don't have an in depth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses  we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences  or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders. We call this the human connectome  and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain. You'll hear more about this in a few minutes. The important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders  the one in five of us who struggle in some way  you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired  but there are some predictable patterns  and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders. It's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex. Here we're talking about traffic jams  or sometimes detours  or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions. You could  if you want  compare this to  on the one hand  a myocardial infarction  a heart attack  where you have dead tissue in the heart  versus an arrhythmia  where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it. Either one would kill you  in only one of them will you find a major lesion. As we think about this  probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder  and that would be schizophrenia  because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters. These are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia  and you can see already in the top there's areas that are red or orange  yellow  are places where there's less gray matter  and as they followed them over five years  comparing them to age match controls  you can see that  particularly in areas like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus  there's a profound loss of gray matter. And it's important  if you try to model this  you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical mass  loss of cortical gray matter  and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark  and at some point  when you overshoot  you cross a threshold  and it's that threshold where we say  this is a person who has this disease  because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions. That's something we can observe. But look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold. They've crossed a brain threshold much earlier  that perhaps not at age    or     but even by age    or    you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain  not at the level of behavior. Why does this matter  Well first because  for brain disorders  behavior is the last thing to change. We know that for Alzheimer's  for Parkinson's  for Huntington's. There are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change. The tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier  long before the symptoms emerge. But most important  go back to where we started. The good news stories in medicine are early detection  early intervention. If we waited until the heart attack  we would be sacrificing  .  million lives every year in this country to heart disease. That is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders  brain circuit disorders  has a behavioral disorder. We wait until the behavior becomes manifest. That's not early detection. That's not early intervention. Now to be clear  we're not quite ready to do this. We don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know what the tools will be  nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different. But this tells us how we need to think about it  and where we need to go. Are we going to be there soon  I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years  but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in concepts and changes in technology.  We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next   .     Bill Gates. Thanks very much. One year ago  I rented a car in Jerusalem to go find a man I'd never met but who had changed my life. I didn't have a phone number to call to say I was coming. I didn't have an exact address  but I knew his name  Abed  I knew that he lived in a town of         Kfar Kara  and I knew that     years before  just outside this holy city  he broke my neck. And so  on an overcast morning in January  I headed north off in a silver Chevy to find a man and some peace. The road dropped and I exited Jerusalem. I then rounded the very bend where his blue truck  heavy with four tons of floor tiles  had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner of the minibus where I sat. I was then    years old. I'd grown five inches and done some        pushups in eight months  and the night before the crash  I delighted in my new body  playing basketball with friends into the wee hours of a May morning. I palmed the ball in my large right hand  and when that hand reached the rim  I felt invincible. I was off in the bus to get the pizza I'd won on the court. I didn't see Abed coming. From my seat  I was looking up at a stone town on a hilltop  bright in the noontime sun  when from behind there was a great bang  as loud and violent as a bomb. My head snapped back over my red seat. My eardrum blew. My shoes flew off. I flew too  my head bobbing on broken bones  and when I landed  I was a quadriplegic. Over the coming months  I learned to breathe on my own  then to sit and to stand and to walk  but my body was now divided vertically. I was a hemiplegic  and back home in New York  I used a wheelchair for four years  all through college. College ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year. There I rose from my chair for good  I leaned on my cane  and I looked back  finding all from my fellow passengers in the bus to photographs of the crash  and when I saw this photograph  I didn't see a bloody and unmoving body. I saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid  and I mourned that it was lost  mourned all I had not yet done  but was now impossible. It was then I read the testimony that Abed gave the morning after the crash  of driving down the right lane of a highway toward Jerusalem. Reading his words  I welled with anger. It was the first time I'd felt anger toward this man  and it came from magical thinking. On this xeroxed piece of paper  the crash had not yet happened. Abed could still turn his wheel left so that I would see him whoosh by out my window and I would remain whole.  Be careful  Abed  look out. Slow down.  But Abed did not slow  and on that xeroxed piece of paper  my neck again broke  and again  I was left without anger. I decided to find Abed  and when I finally did  he responded to my Hebrew hello which such nonchalance  it seemed he'd been awaiting my phone call. And maybe he had. I didn't mention to Abed his prior driving record       violations by the age of     the last  his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that May day   and I didn't mention my prior record    the quadriplegia and the catheters  the insecurity and the loss   and when Abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash  I didn't say that I knew from the police report that he'd escaped serious injury. I said I wanted to meet. Abed said that I should call back in a few weeks  and when I did  and a recording told me that his number was disconnected  I let Abed and the crash go. Many years passed. I walked with my cane and my ankle brace and a backpack on trips in six continents. I pitched overhand in a weekly softball game that I started in Central Park  and home in New York  I became a journalist and an author  typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger. A friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories mirrored my own  each centering on a life that had changed in an instant  owing  if not to a crash  then to an inheritance  a swing of the bat  a click of the shutter  an arrest. Each of us had a before and an after. I'd been working through my lot after all. Still  Abed was far from my mind  when last year  I returned to Israel to write of the crash  and the book I then wrote   Half Life   was nearly complete when I recognized that I still wanted to meet Abed  and finally I understood why  to hear this man say two words   I'm sorry.  People apologize for less. And so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived somewhere in his same town  and I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat  when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering. But what to get the man who broke your fucking neck  I pulled into the town of Abu Ghosh  and bought a brick of Turkish delight  pistachios glued in rosewater. Better. Back on Highway    I envisioned what awaited. Abed would hug me. Abed would spit at me. Abed would say   I'm sorry.  I then began to wonder  as I had many times before  how my life would have been different had this man not injured me  had my genes been fed a different helping of experience. Who was I  Was I who I had been before the crash  before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book  Was I what had been done to me  Were all of us the results of things done to us  done for us  the infidelity of a parent or spouse  money inherited  Were we instead our bodies  their inborn endowments and deficits  It seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience  but how to tease out the one from the other  As Yeats put that same universal question   O body swayed to music  o brightening glance  how can we know the dancer from the dance   I'd been driving for an hour when I looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance. The light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue. The predispositions and impulses that had propelled me as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a Chicago lake  that had propelled me as a teen to jump into wild Cape Cod Bay after a hurricane. But I also saw in my reflection that  had Abed not injured me  I would now  in all likelihood  be a doctor and a husband and a father. I would be less mindful of time and of death  and  oh  I would not be disabled  would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune. The frequent furl of five fingers  the chips in my teeth come from biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open. The dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined. It was approaching    when I exited right toward Afula  and passed a large quarry and was soon in Kfar Kara. I felt a pang of nerves. But Chopin was on the radio  seven beautiful mazurkas  and I pulled into a lot by a gas station to listen and to calm. I'd been told that in an Arab town  one need only mention the name of a local and it will be recognized. And I was mentioning Abed and myself  noting deliberately that I was here in peace  to the people in this town  when I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon. He listened to me. You know  it was most often when speaking to people that I wondered where I ended and my disability began  for many people told me what they told no one else. Many cried. And one day  after a woman I met on the street did the same and I later asked her why  she told me that  best she could tell  her tears had had something to do with my being happy and strong  but vulnerable too. I listened to her words. I suppose they were true. I was me  but I was now me despite a limp  and that  I suppose  was what now made me  me. Anyway  Mohamed told me what perhaps he would not have told another stranger. He led me to a house of cream stucco  then drove off. And as I sat contemplating what to say  a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe. I stepped from my car and said  Shalom   and identified myself  and she told me that her husband Abed would be home from work in four hours. Her Hebrew was not good  and she later confessed that she thought that I had come to install the Internet. I drove off and returned at       thankful to the minaret up the road that helped me find my way back. And as I approached the front door  Abed saw me  my jeans and flannel and cane  and I saw Abed  an average looking man of average size. He wore black and white  slippers over socks  pilling sweatpants  a piebald sweater  a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead. He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned. And so at once  we shook hands  and smiled  and I gave him my gift  and he told me I was a guest in his home  and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch. It was then that Abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone    years before. He'd just had surgery on his eyes  he said. He had problems with his side and his legs too  and  oh  he'd lost his teeth in the crash. Did I wish to see him remove them  Abed then rose and turned on the TV so that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room  and returned with polaroids of the crash and his old driver's license.  I was handsome   he said. We looked down at his laminated mug. Abed had been less handsome than substantial  with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck. It was this youth who on May           had broken two necks including mine  and bruised one brain and taken one life. Twenty one years later  he was now thinner than his wife  his skin slack on his face  and looking at Abed looking at his young self  I remembered looking at that photograph of my young self after the crash  and recognized his longing.  The crash changed both of our lives   I said. Abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck  and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver in the left lane who did not let him pass. I did not want to recap the crash with Abed. I'd hoped for something simpler  to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way. And so I didn't point out that in his own testimony the morning after the crash  Abed did not even mention the bus driver. No  I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth. I had come for remorse. And so I now went looking for remorse and threw truth under the bus.  I understand   I said   that the crash was not your fault  but does it make you sad that others suffered   Abed spoke three quick words.  Yes  I suffered.  Abed then told me why he'd suffered. He'd lived an unholy life before the crash  and so God had ordained the crash  but now  he said  he was religious  and God was pleased. It was then that God intervened  news on the TV of a car wreck that hours before had killed three people up north. We looked up at the wreckage.  Strange   I said.  Strange   he agreed. I had the thought that there  on Route      there were perpetrators and victims  dyads bound by a crash. Some  as had Abed  would forget the date. Some  as had I  would remember. The report finished and Abed spoke.  It is a pity   he said   that the police in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers.  I was baffled. Abed had said something remarkable. Did it point up the degree to which he'd absolved himself of the crash  Was it evidence of guilt  an assertion that he should have been put away longer  He'd served six months in prison  lost his truck license for a decade. I forgot my discretion.  Um  Abed   I said   I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash.   Well   he said   I once went    in a   .  And so    violations    driving through a red light  driving at excessive speed  driving on the wrong side of a barrier  and finally  riding his brakes down that hill    reduced to one. And it was then I understood that no matter how stark the reality  the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable. The goat becomes the hero. The perpetrator becomes the victim. It was then I understood that Abed would never apologize. Abed and I sat with our coffee. We'd spent    minutes together  and he was now known to me. He was not a particularly bad man or a particularly good man. He was a limited man who'd found it within himself to be kind to me. With a nod to Jewish custom  he told me that I should live to be     years old. But it was hard for me to relate to one who had so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing  to one whose life was so unexamined that he said he thought two people had died in the crash. There was much I wished to say to Abed. I wished to tell him that  were he to acknowledge my disability  it would be okay  for people are wrong to marvel at those like me who smile as we limp. People don't know that they have lived through worse  that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck  that problems of the mind are greater still  more injurious  than a hundred broken necks. I wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are most of all is not our minds and not our bodies and not what happens to us  but how we respond to what happens to us.  This   wrote the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl   is the last of the human freedoms  to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.  I wished to tell him that not only paralyzers and paralyzees must evolve  reconcile to reality  but we all must    the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding and the bankrupt and everyone. I wished to tell him that one does not have to say that a bad thing is good  that a crash is from God and so a crash is good  a broken neck is good. One can say that a bad thing sucks  but that this natural world still has many glories. I wished to tell him that  in the end  our mandate is clear  We have to rise above bad fortune. We have to be in the good and enjoy the good  study and work and adventure and friendship    oh  friendship    and community and love. But most of all  I wished to tell him what Herman Melville wrote  that  truly to enjoy bodily warmth  some small part of you must be cold  for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.  Yes  contrast. If you are mindful of what you do not have  you may be truly mindful of what you do have  and if the gods are kind  you may truly enjoy what you have. That is the one singular gift you may receive if you suffer in any existential way. You know death  and so may wake each morning pulsing with ready life. Some part of you is cold  and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm  or even to be cold. When one morning  years after the crash  I stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot felt the flash of cold  nerves at last awake  it was exhilarating  a gust of snow. But I didn't say these things to Abed. I told him only that he had killed one man  not two. I told him the name of that man. And then I said   Goodbye.  Thank you. Thanks a lot. One of the things I want to establish right from the start is that not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots. I just wanted you to know that. So I am indeed a neurosurgeon  and I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery  and what I'm going to tell you about today is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain  being able to go anywhere in the brain and turning areas of the brain up or down to help our patients. So as I said  neurosurgery comes from a long tradition. It's been around for about       years. In Mesoamerica  there used to be neurosurgery  and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients. And they were trying to    they knew that the brain was involved in neurological and psychiatric disease. They didn't know exactly what they were doing. Not much has changed  by the way.  Laughter  But they thought that  if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease  it must be because you are possessed by an evil spirit. So if you are possessed by an evil spirit causing neurologic or psychiatric problems  then the way to treat this is  of course  to make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape. So this was the thinking back then  and these individuals made these holes. Sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant to go through this because  you can tell that the holes are made partially and then  I think  there was some trepanation  and then they left very quickly and it was only a partial hole  and we know they survived these procedures. But this was common. There were some sites where one percent of all the skulls have these holes  and so you can see that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common  and it was also quite common about       years ago. Now  in the course of time  we've come to realize that different parts of the brain do different things. So there are areas of the brain that are dedicated to controlling your movement or your vision or your memory or your appetite  and so on. And when things work well  then the nervous system works well  and everything functions. But once in a while  things don't go so well  and there's trouble in these circuits  and there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring and causing trouble  or sometimes they're underactive and they're not quite working as they should. Now  the manifestation of this depends on where in the brain these neurons are. So when these neurons are in the motor circuit  you get dysfunction in the movement system  and you get things like Parkinson's disease. When the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood  you get things like depression  and when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function  then you get things like Alzheimer's disease. So what we've been able to do is to pinpoint where these disturbances are in the brain  and we've been able to intervene within these circuits in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down. So this is very much like choosing the correct station on the radio dial. Once you choose the right station  whether it be jazz or opera  in our case whether it be movement or mood  we can put the dial there  and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume  to turn it up or turn it down. So what I'm going to tell you about is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes and turning areas of the brain up and down to see if we can help our patients. And this is accomplished using this kind of device  and this is called deep brain stimulation. So what we're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain. Again  we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime  putting an electrode in  and then this electrode is completely underneath the skin down to a pacemaker in the chest  and with a remote control very much like a television remote control  we can adjust how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain. We can turn it up or down  on or off. Now  about a hundred thousand patients in the world have received deep brain stimulation  and I'm going to show you some examples of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement  disorders of mood and disorders of cognition. So this looks something like this when it's in the brain. You see the electrode going through the skull into the brain and resting there  and we can place this really anywhere in the brain. I tell my friends that no neuron is safe from a neurosurgeon  because we can really reach just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now. Now the first example I'm going to show you is a patient with Parkinson's disease  and this lady has Parkinson's disease  and she has these electrodes in her brain  and I'm going to show you what she's like when the electrodes are turned off and she has her Parkinson's symptoms  and then we're going to turn it on. So this looks something like this. The electrodes are turned off now  and you can see that she has tremor. We're now going to turn it on. It's on. Just turned it on. And this works like that  instantly. And the difference between shaking in this way and not    The difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior of        neurons in her subthalamic nucleus. So we now know how to find these troublemakers and tell them   Gentlemen  that's enough. We want you to stop doing that.  And we do that with electricity. So we use electricity to dictate how they fire  and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity. So in this case  we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons. We started using this technique in other problems  and I'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem that we encountered  a case of dystonia. So dystonia is a disorder affecting children. It's a genetic disorder  and it involves a twisting motion  and these children get progressively more and more twisting until they can't breathe  until they get sores  urinary infections  and then they die. So back in       I was asked to see this young boy  perfectly normal. He has this genetic form of dystonia. There are eight children in the family. Five of them have dystonia. So here he is. This boy is nine years old  perfectly normal until the age six  and then he started twisting his body  first the right foot  then the left foot  then the right arm  then the left arm  then the trunk  and then by the time he arrived  within the course of one or two years of the disease onset  he could no longer walk  he could no longer stand. He was crippled  and indeed the natural progression as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted  progressively disabled  and many of these children do not survive. So he is one of five kids. The only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this. He did not respond to any drugs. We did not know what to do with this boy. We did not know what operation to do  where to go in the brain  but on the basis of our results in Parkinson's disease  we reasoned  why don't we try to suppress the same area in the brain that we suppressed in Parkinson's disease  and let's see what happens  So here he was. We operated on him hoping that he would get better. We did not know. So here he is now  back in Israel where he lives  three months after the procedure  and here he is. On the basis of this result  this is now a procedure that's done throughout the world  and there have been hundreds of children that have been helped with this kind of surgery. This boy is now in university and leads quite a normal life. This has been one of the most satisfying cases that I have ever done in my entire career  to restore movement and walking to this kind of child. We realized that perhaps we could use this technology not only in circuits that control your movement but also circuits that control other things  and the next thing that we took on was circuits that control your mood. And we decided to take on depression  and the reason we took on depression is because it's so prevalent  and as you know  there are many treatments for depression  with medication and psychotherapy  even electroconvulsive therapy  but there are millions of people  and there are still    or    percent of patients with depression that do not respond  and it is these patients that we want to help. And let's see if we can use this technique to help these patients with depression. So the first thing we did was  we compared  what's different in the brain of someone with depression and someone who is normal  and what we did was PET scans to look at the blood flow of the brain  and what we noticed is that in patients with depression compared to normals  areas of the brain are shut down  and those are the areas in blue. So here you really have the blues  and the areas in blue are areas that are involved in motivation  in drive and decision making  and indeed  if you're severely depressed as these patients were  those are impaired. You lack motivation and drive. The other thing we discovered was an area that was overactive  area     seen there in red  and area    is the sadness center of the brain. If I make any of you sad  for example  I make you remember the last time you saw your parent before they died or a friend before they died  this area of the brain lights up. It is the sadness center of the brain. And so patients with depression have hyperactivity. The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot. The thermostat is set at     degrees  and the other areas of the brain  involved in drive and motivation  are shut down. So we wondered  can we place electrodes in this area of sadness and see if we can turn down the thermostat  can we turn down the activity  and what will be the consequence of that  So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression. This is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory. And we placed electrodes in area     and in the top scan you see before the operation  area     the sadness area is red hot  and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue  and then  after three months of continuous stimulation     hours a day  or six months of continuous stimulation  we have a complete reversal of this. We're able to drive down area     down to a more normal level  and we're able to turn back online the frontal lobes of the brain  and indeed we're seeing very striking results in these patients with severe depression. So now we are in clinical trials  and are in Phase III clinical trials  and this may become a new procedure  if it's safe and we find that it's effective  to treat patients with severe depression. I've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation to treat the motor system in cases of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. I've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit in cases of depression. Can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter  Anybody interested in that  Of course we can  right  So what we've decided to do is we're going to try to turbocharge the memory circuits in the brain. We're going to place electrodes within the circuits that regulate your memory and cognitive function to see if we can turn up their activity. Now we're not going to do this in normal people. We're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits  and we've chosen to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease who have cognitive and memory deficits. As you know  this is the main symptom of early onset Alzheimer's disease. So we've placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix  which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit  with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit  and whether that can  in turn  help these patients with Alzheimer's disease. Now it turns out that in Alzheimer's disease  there's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain. The brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose. It uses    percent of all your    even though it only weighs two percent    it uses    times more glucose than it should based on its weight. Twenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain  and as you go from being normal to having mild cognitive impairment  which is a precursor for Alzheimer's  all the way to Alzheimer's disease  then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose. They shut down. They turn off. And indeed  what we see is that these areas in red around the outside ribbon of the brain are progressively getting more and more blue until they shut down completely. This is analogous to having a power failure in an area of the brain  a regional power failure. So the lights are out in parts of the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease  and the question is  are the lights out forever  or can we turn the lights back on  Can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again  So this is what we did. We implanted electrodes in the fornix of patients with Alzheimer's disease  we turned it on  and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain. And indeed  at the top  you'll see before the surgery  the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal  predominantly the parietal and temporal lobes. These areas of the brain are shut down. The lights are out in these areas of the brain. We then put in the DBS electrodes and we wait for a month or a year  and the areas in red represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization. And indeed  we are able to get these areas of the brain that were not using glucose to use glucose once again. So the message here is that  in Alzheimer's disease  the lights are out  but there is someone home  and we're able to turn the power back on to these areas of the brain  and as we do so  we expect that their functions will return. So this is now in clinical trials. We are going to operate on    patients with early Alzheimer's disease to see whether this is safe and effective  whether we can improve their neurologic function. So the message I want to leave you with today is that  indeed  there are several circuits in the brain that are malfunctioning across various disease states  whether we're talking about Parkinson's disease  depression  schizophrenia  Alzheimer's. We are now learning to understand what are the circuits  what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for the clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases. We can now reach those circuits. We can introduce electrodes within those circuits. We can graduate the activity of those circuits. We can turn them down if they are overactive  if they're causing trouble  trouble that is felt throughout the brain  or we can turn them up if they are underperforming  and in so doing  we think that we may be able to help the overall function of the brain. The implications of this  of course  is that we may be able to modify the symptoms of the disease  but I haven't told you but there's also some evidence that we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity  and this is something for the future  to see if  indeed  we not only change the activity but also some of the reparative functions of the brain can be harvested. So I envision that we're going to see a great expansion of indications of this technique. We're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain. One of the most exciting things about this is that  indeed  it involves multidisciplinary work. It involves the work of engineers  of imaging scientists  of basic scientists  of neurologists  psychiatrists  neurosurgeons  and certainly at the interface of these multiple disciplines that there's the excitement. And I think that we will see that we will be able to chase more of these evil spirits out from the brain as time goes on  and the consequence of that  of course  will be that we will be able to help many more patients. Thank you very much. When I was    years old  I had low self esteem. I felt I was not talented at anything. One day  I bought a yo yo. When I tried my first trick  it looked like this. I couldn't even do the simplest trick  but it was very natural for me  because I was not dextrous  and hated all sports. But after one week of practicing  my throws became more like this. A bit better. I thought  the yo yo is something for me to be good at  for the first time in my life. I found my passion. I was spending all my time practicing. It took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level. And then  four years later  when I was    years old  I was standing onstage at the World Yo Yo Contest. And I won. I was so excited.  Yes  I did it  I became a hero. I may get many sponsors  a lot of money  tons of interviews  and be on TV   I thought.  Laughter  But after coming back to Japan  totally nothing changed in my life. I realized society didn't value my passion. So I went back to my college and became a typical Japanese worker as a systems engineer. I felt my passion  heart and soul  had left my body. I felt I was not alive anymore. So I started to consider what I should do  and I thought  I wanted to make my performance better  and to show onstage how spectacular the yo yo could be to change the public's image of the yo yo. So I quit my company and started a career as a professional performer. I started to learn classic ballet  jazz dance  acrobatics and other things to make my performance better. As a result of these efforts  and the help of many others  it happened. I won the World Yo Yo Contest again in the artistic performance division. I passed an audition for Cirque du Soleil. Today  I am standing on the TED stage with the yo yo in front of you. What I learned from the yo yo is  if I make enough effort with huge passion  there is no impossible. Could you let me share my passion with you through my performance  We always hear that texting is a scourge. The idea is that texting spells the decline and fall of any kind of serious literacy  or at least writing ability  among young people in the United States and now the whole world today. The fact of the matter is that it just isn't true  and it's easy to think that it is true  but in order to see it in another way  in order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing  not just energetic  but a miraculous thing  a kind of emergent complexity that we're seeing happening right now  we have to pull the camera back for a bit and look at what language really is  in which case  one thing that we see is that texting is not writing at all. What do I mean by that  Basically  if we think about language  language has existed for perhaps         years  at least        years  and what it arose as is speech. People talked. That's what we're probably genetically specified for. That's how we use language most. Writing is something that came along much later  and as we saw in the last talk  there's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened  but according to traditional estimates  if humanity had existed for    hours  then writing only came along at about       p.m. That's how much of a latterly thing writing is. So first there's speech  and then writing comes along as a kind of artifice. Now don't get me wrong  writing has certain advantages. When you write  because it's a conscious process  because you can look backwards  you can do things with language that are much less likely if you're just talking. For example  imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's  The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire    The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours  till the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight  of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself.  That's beautiful  but let's face it  nobody talks that way. Or at least  they shouldn't if they're interested in reproducing. That    is not the way any human being speaks casually. Casual speech is something quite different. Linguists have actually shown that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way  we tend to speak in word packets of maybe seven to    words. You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record yourself or a group of people talking. That's what speech is like. Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic. It's much less reflective    very different from writing. So we naturally tend to think  because we see language written so often  that that's what language is  but actually what language is  is speech. They are two things. Now of course  as history has gone by  it's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed between speech and writing. So  for example  in a distant era now  it was common when one gave a speech to basically talk like writing. So I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving in an old movie where they clear their throat  and they go   Ahem  ladies and gentlemen   and then they speak in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech. It's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one. It's basically talking like you write  and so  for example  we're thinking so much these days about Lincoln because of the movie. The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event. For two hours before that  Edward Everett spoke on a topic that  frankly  cannot engage us today and barely did then. The point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing. Ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours. It was perfectly natural. That's what people did then  speaking like writing. Well  if you can speak like writing  then logically it follows that you might want to also sometimes write like you speak. The problem was just that in the material  mechanical sense  that was harder back in the day for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it. It's almost impossible to do that with your hand except in shorthand  and then communication is limited. On a manual typewriter it was very difficult  and even when we had electric typewriters  or then computer keyboards  the fact is that even if you can type easily enough to keep up with the pace of speech  more or less  you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly. Once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message  then you have the conditions that allow that we can write like we speak. And that's where texting comes in. And so  texting is very loose in its structure. No one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts  but then again  do you think about those things when you talk  No  and so therefore why would you when you were texting  What texting is  despite the fact that it involves the brute mechanics of something that we call writing  is fingered speech. That's what texting is. Now we can write the way we talk. And it's a very interesting thing  but nevertheless easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline. We see this general bagginess of the structure  the lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to learning on the blackboard  and so we think that something has gone wrong. It's a very natural sense. But the fact of the matter is that what is going on is a kind of emergent complexity. That's what we're seeing in this fingered speech. And in order to understand it  what we want to see is the way  in this new kind of language  there is new structure coming up. And so  for example  there is in texting a convention  which is LOL. Now LOL  we generally think of as meaning  laughing out loud.  And of course  theoretically  it does  and if you look at older texts  then people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud. But if you text now  or if you are someone who is aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become  you'll notice that LOL does not mean laughing out loud anymore. It's evolved into something that is much subtler. This is an actual text that was done by a non male person of about    years old not too long ago.  I love the font you're using  btw.  Julie   lol thanks gmail is being slow right now  Now if you think about it  that's not funny. No one's laughing.  Laughter  And yet  there it is  so you assume there's been some kind of hiccup. Then Susan says  lol  I know   again more guffawing than we're used to when you're talking about these inconveniences. So Julie says   I just sent you an email.  Susan   lol  I see it.  Very funny people  if that's what LOL means. This Julie says   So what's up   Susan   lol  I have to write a    page paper.  She's not amused. Let's think about it. LOL is being used in a very particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles. Any spoken language that's used by real people has them. If you happen to speak Japanese  think about that little word  ne  that you use at the end of a lot of sentences. If you listen to the way black youth today speak  think about the use of the word  yo.  Whole dissertations could be written about it  and probably are being written about it. A pragmatic particle  that's what LOL has gradually become. It's a way of using the language between actual people. Another example is  slash.  Now  we can use slash in the way that we're used to  along the lines of   We're going to have a party slash networking session.  That's kind of like what we're at. Slash is used in a very different way in texting among young people today. It's used to change the scene. So for example  this Sally person says   So I need to find people to chill with  and Jake says   Haha     you could write a dissertation about  Haha  too  but we don't have time for that    Haha so you're going by yourself  Why   Sally   For this summer program at NYU.  Jake   Haha. Slash I'm watching this video with suns players trying to shoot with one eye.  The slash is interesting. I don't really even know what Jake is talking about after that  but you notice that he's changing the topic. Now that seems kind of mundane  but think about how in real life  if we're having a conversation and we want to change the topic  there are ways of doing it gracefully. You don't just zip right into it. You'll pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance  or you'll say something like   Hmm  makes you think     when it really didn't  but what you're really    what you're really trying to do is change the topic. You can't do that while you're texting  and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium. All spoken languages have what a linguist calls a new information marker    or two  or three. Texting has developed one from this slash. So we have a whole battery of new constructions that are developing  and yet it's easy to think  well  something is still wrong. There's a lack of structure of some sort. It's not as sophisticated as the language of The Wall Street Journal. Well  the fact of the matter is  look at this person in       and this is when texting doesn't exist   I Love Lucy  is still on the air.  Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table  cannot write grammatically      We've heard that sort of thing before  not just in     .       Connecticut schoolteacher.     . This is the time when we all assume that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect because the people on  Downton Abbey  are articulate  or something like that. So   From every college in the country goes up the cry  'Our freshmen can't spell  can't punctuate.'  And so on. You can go even further back than this. It's the President of Harvard. It's     . There's no electricity. People have three names.  Bad spelling  incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing.  And he's talking about people who are otherwise well prepared for college studies. You can go even further back.       some long lost superintendent of schools is upset because of what he has for a long time  noted with regret the almost entire neglect of the original  blah blah blah blah blah. Or you can go all the way back to    A.D.     Laughter     and there's this poor man who doesn't like the way people are speaking Latin. As it happens  he was writing about what had become French. And so  there are always    Laughter   Applause    there are always people worrying about these things and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning. And so  the way I'm thinking of texting these days is that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing that young people are developing  which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills  and that means that they're able to do two things. Increasing evidence is that being bilingual is cognitively beneficial. That's also true of being bidialectal. That's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing. And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act that young people are using today  not consciously  of course  but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire. It's very simple. If somebody from      looked at what was on a dormitory message board in       the slang would have changed a little bit since the era of  Love Story   but they would understand what was on that message board. Take that person from         not that long ago  this is  Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure     those people. Take those people and they read a very typical text written by a    year old today. Often they would have no idea what half of it meant because a whole new language has developed among our young people doing something as mundane as what it looks like to us when they're batting around on their little devices. So in closing  if I could go into the future  if I could go into       the first thing I would ask is whether David Simon had done a sequel to  The Wire.  I would want to know. And   I really would ask that   and then I'd want to know actually what was going on on  Downton Abbey.  That'd be the second thing. And then the third thing would be  please show me a sheaf of texts written by    year old girls  because I would want to know where this language had developed since our times  and ideally I would then send them back to you and me now so we could examine this linguistic miracle happening right under our noses. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  That's how we traveled in the year     . That's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating. It doesn't have air conditioning. That horse is pulling it along at one percent of the speed of sound  and the rutted dirt road turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains. That's a Boeing    . Only    years later  it travels at    percent of the speed of sound  and we don't travel any faster today because commercial supersonic air travel turned out to be a bust. So I started wondering and pondering  could it be that the best years of American economic growth are behind us  And that leads to the suggestion  maybe economic growth is almost over. Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial. There are four headwinds that are just hitting the American economy in the face. They're demographics  education  debt and inequality. They're powerful enough to cut growth in half. So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline. And here's my theme  Because of the headwinds  if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last     years  growth is cut in half. If innovation is less powerful  invents less great  wonderful things  then growth is going to be even lower than half of history. Now here's eight centuries of economic growth. The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth  zero percent a year  one percent a year  two percent a year. The white line is for the U.K.  and then the U.S. takes over as the leading nation in the year       when the line switches to red. You'll notice that  for the first four centuries  there's hardly any growth at all  just  .  percent. Then growth gets better and better. It maxes out in the     s  '  s and '  s  and then it starts slowing down  and here's a cautionary note. That last downward notch in the red line is not actual data. That is a forecast that I made six years ago that growth would slow down to  .  percent. But you know what the actual facts are  You know what the growth in per person income has been in the United States in the last six years  Negative. This led to a fantasy. What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record  I can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted  but I decided I would end it at  .   just like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries. Now the history that we've achieved is that we've grown at  .  percent per year over the whole period       to       and remember it's been a little bit negative since     . But if growth slows down  instead of doubling our standard of living every generation  Americans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents  or even a quarter  more well off than  their parents. Now we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income. The vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices. You'll notice that in       over on the left  we were at about       dollars. Today we're at about        dollars of total output per member of the population. Now what if we could achieve that historic two percent growth for the next    years  Well  it's a matter of arithmetic. Two percent growth quadruples your standard of living in    years. That means we'd go from        to        . Well  we're not going to do that  and the reason is the headwinds. The first headwind is demographics. It's a truism that your standard of living rises faster than productivity  rises faster than output per hour  if hours per person increased. And we got that gift back in the '  s and '  s when women entered the labor force. But now it's turned around. Now hours per person are shrinking  first because of the retirement of the baby boomers  and second because there's been a very significant dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution. The next headwind is education. We've got problems all over our educational system despite Race to the Top. In college  we've got cost inflation in higher education that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care. We have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt  and our college completion rate is    points     percentage points below Canada. We have a lot of debt. Our economy grew from      to      on the back of consumers massively overborrowing. Consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons why our economic recovery is so sluggish today. And everybody of course knows that the federal government debt is growing as a share of GDP at a very rapid rate  and the only way that's going to stop is some combination of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements  also called transfer payments. And that gets us down from the  .   where we've reached for education  down to  . . And then we have inequality. Over the    years before the financial crisis  the growth rate of the bottom    percent of the income distribution was half a point slower than the averages we've been talking about before. All the rest went to the top one percent. So that brings us down to  . . And that  .  is the big challenge. Are we going to grow at  .   If so  that's going to require that our inventions are as important as the ones that happened over the last     years. So let's see what some of those inventions were. If you wanted to read in      at night  you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp. They created pollution  they created odors  they were hard to control  the light was dim  and they were a fire hazard. By       electric light was everywhere. We had the vertical city  the invention of the elevator. Central Manhattan became possible. And then  in addition to that  at the same time  hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools and hand powered electric tools  all achieved by electricity. Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women. Women  back in the late   th century  spent two days a week doing the laundry. They did it on a scrub board. Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry. Then they had to bring them in. The whole thing took two days out of the seven day week. And then we had the electric washing machine. And by       they were everywhere. But the women still had to shop every day  but no they didn't  because electricity brought us the electric refrigerator. Back in the late   th century  the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating. The bedrooms were cold. They were unheated. But by       certainly by       we had central heating everywhere. What about the internal combustion engine  which was invented in       In America  before the motor vehicle  transportation depended entirely on the urban horse  which dropped  without restraint     to    pounds of manure on the streets every day together with a gallon of urine. That comes out at five to    tons daily per square mile in cities. Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land. That's the percentage of American agricultural land it took to feed the horses. Of course  when the motor vehicle was invented  and it became almost ubiquitous by       that agricultural land could be used for human consumption or for export. And here's an interesting ratio  Starting from zero in       only    years later  the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the United States reached    percent in just    years. Back before the turn of the century  women had another problem. All the water for cooking  cleaning and bathing had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside. It's a historical fact that in       the average North Carolina housewife walked     miles a year carrying    tons of water. But by       cities around the country had put in underground water pipes. They had put in underground sewer pipes  and as a result  one of the great scourges of the late   th century  waterborne diseases like cholera  began to disappear. And an amazing fact for techno optimists is that in the first half of the   th century  the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster than it was in the second half of the   th century. So it's a truism that things can't be more than     percent of themselves. And I'll just give you a few examples. We went from one percent to    percent of the speed of sound. Electrification  central heat  ownership of motor cars  they all went from zero to     percent. Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm. We went from    percent urban to    percent by the early postwar years. What about the electronic revolution  Here's an early computer. It's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in     . By      we had telephone bills  bank statements were being produced by computers. The earliest cell phones  the earliest personal computers were invented in the     s. The     s brought us Bill Gates  DOS  ATM machines to replace bank tellers  bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector. Fast forward through the '  s  we had the dotcom revolution and a temporary rise in productivity growth. But I'm now going to give you an experiment. You have to choose either option A or option B. Option A is you get to keep everything invented up till    years ago. So you get Google  you get Amazon  you get Wikipedia  and you get running water and indoor toilets. Or you get everything invented to yesterday  including Facebook and your iPhone  but you have to give up  go out to the outhouse  and carry in the water. Hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the   th century  maybe for a couple of days  in some cases for more than a week  electricity  running water  heating  gasoline for their cars  and a charge for their iPhones. The problem we face is that all these great inventions  we have to match them in the future  and my prediction that we're not going to match them brings us down from the original two percent growth down to  .   the fanciful curve that I drew you at the beginning. So here we are back to the horse and buggy. I'd like to award an Oscar to the inventors of the   th century  the people from Alexander Graham Bell to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers  I'd like to call them all up here  and they're going to call back to you. Your challenge is  can you match what we achieved  Thank you. Growth is not dead. Let's start the story     years ago  when American factories began to electrify their operations  igniting the Second Industrial Revolution. The amazing thing is that productivity did not increase in those factories for    years. Thirty years. That's long enough for a generation of managers to retire. You see  the first wave of managers simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors  but they didn't redesign the factories to take advantage of electricity's flexibility. It fell to the next generation to invent new work processes  and then productivity soared  often doubling or even tripling in those factories. Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology  like the steam engine before it. General purpose technologies drive most economic growth  because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations  like lightbulbs and  yes  factory redesign. Is there a general purpose technology of our era  Sure. It's the computer. But technology alone is not enough. Technology is not destiny. We shape our destiny  and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories  we're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system. We're not doing as well at that job as we should be. As we'll see in a moment  productivity is actually doing all right  but it has become decoupled from jobs  and the income of the typical worker is stagnating. These troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed as the end of innovation  but they are actually the growing pains of what Andrew McAfee and I call the new machine age. Let's look at some data. So here's GDP per person in America. There's some bumps along the way  but the big story is you could practically fit a ruler to it. This is a log scale  so what looks like steady growth is actually an acceleration in real terms. And here's productivity. You can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid '  s  but it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution  when factories were learning how to electrify their operations. After a lag  productivity accelerated again. So maybe  history doesn't repeat itself  but sometimes it rhymes.  Today  productivity is at an all time high  and despite the Great Recession  it grew faster in the     s than it did in the     s  the roaring     s  and that was faster than the '  s or '  s. It's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution. And that's just the United States. The global news is even better. Worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate in the past decade than ever in history. If anything  all these numbers actually understate our progress  because the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production. It's mind not matter  brain not brawn  ideas not things. That creates a problem for standard metrics  because we're getting more and more stuff for free  like Wikipedia  Google  Skype  and if they post it on the web  even this TED Talk. Now getting stuff for free is a good thing  right  Sure  of course it is. But that's not how economists measure GDP. Zero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics. According to the numbers  the music industry is half the size that it was    years ago  but I'm listening to more and better music than ever. You know  I bet you are too. In total  my research estimates that the GDP numbers miss over     billion dollars per year in free goods and services on the Internet. Now let's look to the future. There are some super smart people who are arguing that we've reached the end of growth  but to understand the future of growth  we need to make predictions about the underlying drivers of growth. I'm optimistic  because the new machine age is digital  exponential and combinatorial. When goods are digital  they can be replicated with perfect quality at nearly zero cost  and they can be delivered almost instantaneously. Welcome to the economics of abundance. But there's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world. Measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress. In the age of big data  we can measure the world in ways we never could before. Secondly  the new machine age is exponential. Computers get better faster than anything else ever. A child's Playstation today is more powerful than a military supercomputer from     . But our brains are wired for a linear world. As a result  exponential trends take us by surprise. I used to teach my students that there are some things  you know  computers just aren't good at  like driving a car through traffic. That's right  here's Andy and me grinning like madmen because we just rode down Route     in  yes  a driverless car. Thirdly  the new machine age is combinatorial. The stagnationist view is that ideas get used up  like low hanging fruit  but the reality is that each innovation creates building blocks for even more innovations. Here's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks  an undergraduate student of mine built an app that ultimately reached  .  million users. He was able to do that so easily because he built it on top of Facebook  and Facebook was built on top of the web  and that was built on top of the Internet  and so on and so forth. Now individually  digital  exponential and combinatorial would each be game changers. Put them together  and we're seeing a wave of astonishing breakthroughs  like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound. You know  robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation. But perhaps the most important invention  the most important invention is machine learning. Consider one project  IBM's Watson. These little dots here  those are all the champions on the quiz show  Jeopardy.  At first  Watson wasn't very good  but it improved at a rate faster than any human could  and shortly after Dave Ferrucci showed this chart to my class at MIT  Watson beat the world  Jeopardy  champion. At age seven  Watson is still kind of in its childhood. Recently  its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised. The next day  it started answering questions with profanities. Damn.  Laughter  But you know  Watson is growing up fast. It's being tested for jobs in call centers  and it's getting them. It's applying for legal  banking and medical jobs  and getting some of them. Isn't it ironic that at the very moment we are building intelligent machines  perhaps the most important invention in human history  some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating  Like the first two industrial revolutions  the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out  but they are staggering. So does that mean we have nothing to worry about  No. Technology is not destiny. Productivity is at an all time high  but fewer people now have jobs. We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever  but for a majority of Americans  their income has fallen. This is the great decoupling of productivity from employment  of wealth from work. You know  it's not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling  but like too many others  they misunderstand its basic causes. Technology is racing ahead  but it's leaving more and more people behind. Today  we can take a routine job  codify it in a set of machine readable instructions  and then replicate it a million times. You know  I recently overheard a conversation that epitomizes these new economics. This guy says   Nah  I don't use H R Block anymore. TurboTax does everything that my tax preparer did  but it's faster  cheaper and more accurate.  How can a skilled worker compete with a     piece of software  She can't. Today  millions of Americans do have faster  cheaper  more accurate tax preparation  and the founders of Intuit have done very well for themselves. But    percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs. That is a microcosm of what's happening  not just in software and services  but in media and music  in finance and manufacturing  in retailing and trade    in short  in every industry. People are racing against the machine  and many of them are losing that race. What can we do to create shared prosperity  The answer is not to try to slow down technology. Instead of racing against the machine  we need to learn to race with the machine. That is our grand challenge. The new machine age can be dated to a day    years ago when Garry Kasparov  the world chess champion  played Deep Blue  a supercomputer. The machine won that day  and today  a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grandmaster. It got so bad that  when he was asked what strategy he would use against a computer  Jan Donner  the Dutch grandmaster  replied   I'd bring a hammer.  But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion. Neither is a human  because Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament where teams of humans and computers could work together  and the winning team had no grandmaster  and it had no supercomputer. What they had was better teamwork  and they showed that a team of humans and computers  working together  could beat any computer or any human working alone. Racing with the machine beats racing against the machine. Technology is not destiny. We shape our destiny. Thank you. Let's face it  Driving is dangerous. It's one of the things that we don't like to think about  but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages    to    in the United States    leading cause of death    and    percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol. So what happens  No one can say for sure  but I remember my first accident. I was a young driver out on the highway  and the car in front of me  I saw the brake lights go on. I'm like   Okay  all right  this guy is slowing down  I'll slow down too.  I step on the brake. But no  this guy isn't slowing down. This guy is stopping  dead stop  dead stop on the highway. It was just going       to zero  I slammed on the brakes. I felt the ABS kick in  and the car is still going  and it's not going to stop  and I know it's not going to stop  and the air bag deploys  the car is totaled  and fortunately  no one was hurt. But I had no idea that car was stopping  and I think we can do a lot better than that. I think we can transform the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other. I just want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now. Get into your car. Close the door. You're in a glass bubble. You can't really directly sense the world around you. You're in this extended body. You're tasked with navigating it down partially seen roadways  in and amongst other metal giants  at super human speeds. Okay  And all you have to guide you are your two eyes. Okay  so that's all you have  eyes that weren't really designed for this task  but then people ask you to do things like  you want to make a lane change  what's the first thing they ask you do  Take your eyes off the road. That's right. Stop looking where you're going  turn  check your blind spot  and drive down the road without looking where you're going. You and everyone else. This is the safe way to drive. Why do we do this  Because we have to  we have to make a choice  do I look here or do I look here  What's more important  And usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road. But occasionally we miss something. Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late. In countless accidents  the driver says   I didn't see it coming.  And I believe that. I believe that. We can only watch so much. But the technology exists now that can help us improve that. In the future  with cars exchanging data with each other  we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind  to the right and left  all at the same time  bird's eye view  we will actually be able to see into those cars. We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us  to see how fast that guy's going or stopping. If that guy's going down to zero  I'll know. And with computation and algorithms and predictive models  we will be able to see the future. You may think that's impossible. How can you predict the future  That's really hard. Actually  no. With cars  it's not impossible. Cars are three dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity. They travel down roads. Often they travel on pre published routes. It's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions about where a car's going to be in the near future. Even if  when you're in your car and some motorcyclist comes    bshoom        miles an hour down  lane splitting    I know you've had this experience    that guy didn't  just come out of nowhere.  That guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour. Right  I mean  somebody's seen him. Ten         miles back  someone's seen that guy  and as soon as one car sees that guy and puts him on the map  he's on the map    position  velocity  good estimate he'll continue going    miles an hour. You'll know  because your car will know  because that other car will have whispered something in his ear  like   By the way  five minutes  motorcyclist  watch out.  You can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave. I mean  they're Newtonian objects. That's very nice about them. So how do we get there  We can start with something as simple as sharing our position data between cars  just sharing GPS. If I have a GPS and a camera in my car  I have a pretty precise idea of where I am and how fast I'm going. With computer vision  I can estimate where the cars around me are  sort of  and where they're going. And same with the other cars. They can have a precise idea of where they are  and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are. What happens if two cars share that data  if they talk to each other  I can tell you exactly what happens. Both models improve. Everybody wins. Professor Bob Wang and his team have done computer simulations of what happens when fuzzy estimates combine  even in light traffic  when cars just share GPS data  and we've moved this research out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now on these robots  stereo cameras  GPS  and the two dimensional laser range finders that are common in backup systems. We also attach a discrete short range communication radio  and the robots talk to each other. When these robots come at each other  they track each other's position precisely  and they can avoid each other. We're now adding more and more robots into the mix  and we encountered some problems. One of the problems  when you get too much chatter  it's hard to process all the packets  so you have to prioritize  and that's where the predictive model helps you. If your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories  you don't pay as much attention to those packets. You prioritize the one guy who seems to be going a little off course. That guy could be a problem. And you can predict the new trajectory. So you don't only know that he's going off course  you know how. And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way. And we wanted to do    how can we best alert everyone  How can these cars whisper   You need to get out of the way   Well  it depends on two things  one  the ability of the car  and second the ability of the driver. If one guy has a really great car  but they're on their phone or  you know  doing something  they're not probably in the best position to react in an emergency. So we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling. And now  using a series of three cameras  we can detect if a driver is looking forward  looking away  looking down  on the phone  or having a cup of coffee. We can predict the accident and we can predict who  which cars  are in the best position to move out of the way to calculate the safest route for everyone. Fundamentally  these technologies exist today. I think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data. I think it's a very disconcerting notion  this idea that our cars will be watching us  talking about us to other cars  that we'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip. But I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy  just like right now  when I look at your car from the outside  I don't really know about you. If I look at your license plate number  I don't really know who you are. I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs. And I think it's going to be a great thing. I want you to consider for a moment if you really don't want the distracted teenager behind you to know that you're braking  that you're coming to a dead stop. By sharing our data willingly  we can do what's best for everyone. So let your car gossip about you. It's going to make the roads a lot safer. Thank you. I've noticed something interesting about society and culture. Everything risky requires a license. So  learning to drive  owning a gun  getting married. There's a certain    That's true in everything risky  except technology. For some reason  there's no standard syllabus  there's no basic course. They just sort of give you your computer and then kick you out of the nest. You're supposed to learn this stuff    how  Just by osmosis. Nobody ever sits down and tells you   This is how it works.  So today I'm going to tell you ten things that you thought everybody knew  but it turns out they don't. First of all  on the web  if you want to scroll down  don't pick up the mouse and use the scroll bar. That's a terrible waste of time. Do that only if you're paid by the hour. Instead  hit the space bar. The space bar scrolls down one page. Hold down the Shift key to scroll back up again. So  space bar to scroll down one page  works in every browser  in every kind of computer. Also on the web  when you're filling in one of these forms like your addresses  I assume you know that you can hit the Tab key to jump from box to box to box. But what about the pop up menu where you put in your state  Don't open the pop up menu. That's a terrible waste of calories. Type the first letter of your state over and over and over. So if you want Connecticut  go  C  C  C. If you want Texas  go T  T  and you jump right to that thing without even opening the pop up menu. Also on the web  when the text is too small  what you do is hold down the Control key and hit plus  plus  plus. You make the text larger with each tap. Works on every computer  every web browser  or minus  minus  to get smaller again. If you're on the Mac  it might be Command instead. When you're typing on your Blackberry  Android  iPhone  don't bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout to hit the period and then a space  then try to capitalize the next letter. Just hit the space bar twice. The phone puts the period  the space  and the capital for you. Go space  space. It is totally amazing. Also when it comes to cell phones  on all phones  if you want to redial somebody that you've dialed before  all you have to do is hit the call button  and it puts the last phone number into the box for you  and at that point you can hit call again to actually dial it. No need to go to the recent calls list if you're trying to call somebody just hit the call button again. Something that drives me crazy  When I call you and leave a message on your voice mail  I hear you saying   Leave a message   and then I get these    seconds of freaking instructions  like we haven't had answering machines for    years  I'm not bitter. So it turns out there's a keyboard shortcut that lets you jump directly to the beep like this. Phone  At the tone  please... David Pogue  Unfortunately  the carriers didn't adopt the same keystroke  so it's different by carrier  so it devolves upon you to learn the keystroke for the person you're calling. I didn't say these were going to be perfect. So most of you think of Google as something that lets you look up a web page  but it is also a dictionary. Type the word  define  and the word you want to know. You don't even have to click anything. There's the definition as you type. It's also a complete FAA database. Type the name of the airline and the flight. It shows you where the flight is  the gate  the terminal  how long until it lands. You don't need an app. It's also unit and currency conversion. Again  you don't have to click one of the results. Just type it into the box  and there's your answer. While we're talking about text    When you want to highlight    this is just an example    When you want to highlight a word  please don't waste your life dragging across it with the mouse like a newbie. Double click the word. Watch          I go double click  it neatly selects just that word. Also  don't delete what you've highlighted. You can just type over it. This is in every program. Also  you can go double click  drag  to highlight in one word increments as you drag. Much more precise. Again  don't bother deleting. Just type over it. Shutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button and the moment the camera actually snaps. It's extremely frustrating on any camera under       . So  that's because the camera needs time to calculate the focus and exposure  but if you pre focus with a half press  leave your finger down    no shutter lag  You get it every time. I've just turned your     camera into a        camera with that trick. And finally  it often happens that you're giving a talk  and for some reason  the audience is looking at the slide instead of at you  So when that happens    this works in Keynote  PowerPoint  it works in every program    all you do is hit the letter B key  B for blackout  to black out the slide  make everybody look at you  and then when you're ready to go on  you hit B again  and if you're really on a roll  you can hit the W key for  whiteout   and you white out the slide  and then you can hit W again to un blank it. So I know I went super fast. If you missed anything  I'll be happy to send you the list of these tips. In the meantime  congratulations. You all get your California Technology License. Have a great day. What you're doing  right now  at this very moment  is killing you. More than cars or the Internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about  the technology you're using the most almost every day is this  your tush. Nowadays people are sitting  .  hours a day  which is more than we're sleeping  at  .  hours. Sitting is so incredibly prevalent  we don't even question how much we're doing it  and because everyone else is doing it  it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay. In that way  sitting has become the smoking of our generation. Of course there's health consequences to this  scary ones  besides the waist. Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical  activity   Ten percent in fact  on both of those. Six percent for heart disease  seven percent for type   diabetes  which is what my father died of. Now  any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more  but if you're anything like me  it won't. What did get me moving was a social interaction. Someone invited me to a meeting  but couldn't manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting  and said   I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then   It seemed kind of odd to do  and actually  that first meeting  I remember thinking   I have to be the one to ask the next question   because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation. And yet  I've taken that idea and made it my own. So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent lit conference room meetings  I ask people to go on a walking meeting  to the tune of    to    miles a week. It's changed my life. But before that  what actually happened was  I used to think about it as  you could take care of your health  or you could take care of obligations  and one always came at the cost of the other. So now  several hundred of these walking meetings later  I've learned a few things. First  there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out of the box thinking. Whether it's nature or the exercise itself  it certainly works. And second  and probably the more reflective one  is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they're really not that way. And if we're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently  whether it's in governance or business or environmental issues  job creation  maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true. Because it was when that happened with this walk and talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable. So I started this talk talking about the tush  so I'll end with the bottom line  which is  walk and talk. Walk the talk. You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking  and in the way that you do  you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas. Thank you. Well  I have a big announcement to make today  and I'm really excited about this. And this may be a little bit of a surprise to many of you who know my research and what I've done well. I've really tried to solve some big problems  counterterrorism  nuclear terrorism  and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer  but I started thinking about all these problems  and I realized that the really biggest problem we face  what all these other problems come down to  is energy  is electricity  the flow of electrons. And I decided that I was going to set out to try to solve this problem. And this probably is not what you're expecting. You're probably expecting me to come up here and talk about fusion  because that's what I've done most of my life. But this is actually a talk about  okay    but this is actually a talk about fission. It's about perfecting something old  and bringing something old into the   st century. Let's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works. In a nuclear power plant  you have a big pot of water that's under high pressure  and you have some fuel rods  and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium  and they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel  and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level  and that reaction heats up water  the water turns to steam  steam turns the turbine  and you produce electricity from it. This is the same way we've been producing electricity  the steam turbine idea  for     years  and nuclear was a really big advancement in a way to heat the water  but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine. And I thought  you know  is this the best way to do it  Is fission kind of played out  or is there something left to innovate here  And I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world. And this is what it is. This is a small modular reactor. So it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here. This is between    and     megawatts. But that's a ton of power. That's between  say at an average use  that's maybe        to         homes could run off that. Now the really interesting thing about these reactors is they're built in a factory. So they're modular reactors that are built essentially on an assembly line  and they're trucked anywhere in the world  you plop them down  and they produce electricity. This region right here is the reactor. And this is buried below ground  which is really important. For someone who's done a lot of counterterrorism work  I can't extol to you how great having something buried below the ground is for proliferation and security concerns. And inside this reactor is a molten salt  so anybody who's a fan of thorium  they're going to be really excited about this  because these reactors happen to be really good at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle  uranium    . But I'm not really concerned about the fuel. You can run these off    they're really hungry  they really like down blended weapons pits  so that's highly enriched uranium and weapons grade plutonium that's been down blended. It's made into a grade where it's not usable for a nuclear weapon  but they love this stuff. And we have a lot of it sitting around  because this is a big problem. You know  in the Cold War  we built up this huge arsenal of nuclear weapons  and that was great  and we don't need them anymore  and what are we doing with all the waste  essentially  What are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons  Well  we're securing them  and it would be great if we could burn them  eat them up  and this reactor loves this stuff. So it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core  and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt  the radioactive salt  to a cold salt which isn't radioactive. It's still thermally hot but it's not radioactive. And then that's a heat exchanger to what makes this design really  really interesting  and that's a heat exchanger to a gas. So going back to what I was saying before about all power being produced    well  other than photovoltaic    being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine  that's actually not that efficient  and in fact  in a nuclear power plant like this  it's only roughly    to    percent efficient. That's how much thermal energy the reactor's putting out to how much electricity it's producing. And the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors operate at pretty low temperature. They operate anywhere from  you know  maybe     to     degrees Celsius. And these reactors run at     to     degrees Celsius  which means the higher the temperature you go to  thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies. And this reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas  so supercritical CO  or helium  and that goes into a turbine  and this is called the Brayton cycle. This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity  and this makes this almost    percent efficient  between    and    percent efficiency. And I'm really excited about this  because it's a very compact core. Molten salt reactors are very compact by nature  but what's also great is you get a lot more electricity out for how much uranium you're fissioning  not to mention the fact that these burn up. Their burn up is much higher. So for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor  a lot more of it's being used. And the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this is  you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium  and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets. Well  uranium dioxide's a ceramic  and ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it. So you have what's called the xenon pit  and so some of these fission products love neutrons. They love the neutrons that are going on and helping this reaction take place. And they eat them up  which means that  combined with the fact that the cladding doesn't last very long  you can only run one of these reactors for roughly  say     months without refueling it. So these reactors run for    years without refueling  which is  in my opinion  very  very amazing  because it means it's a sealed system. No refueling means you can seal them up and they're not going to be a proliferation risk  and they're not going to have either nuclear material or radiological material proliferated from their cores. But let's go back to safety  because everybody after Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear  and one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe  and I'm really excited about this reactor for essentially two reasons. One  it doesn't operate at high pressure. So traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor  they're very  very hot water at very high pressures  and this means  essentially  in the event of an accident  if you had any kind of breach of this stainless steel pressure vessel  the coolant would leave the core. These reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure  so there's no inclination for the fission products to leave the reactor in the event of an accident. Also  they operate at high temperatures  and the fuel is molten  so they can't melt down  but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances  or you lost off site power in the case of something like Fukushima  there's a dump tank. Because your fuel is liquid  and it's combined with your coolant  you could actually just drain the core into what's called a sub critical setting  basically a tank underneath the reactor that has some neutrons absorbers. And this is really important  because the reaction stops. In this kind of reactor  you can't do that. The fuel  like I said  is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods  and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors  Fukushima and Three Mile Island    looking back at Three Mile Island  we didn't really see this for a while   but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods  what happens is  when they see high pressure water  steam  in an oxidizing environment  they'll actually produce hydrogen  and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products. So the core of this reactor  since it's not under pressure and it doesn't have this chemical reactivity  means that there's no inclination for the fission products to leave this reactor. So even in the event of an accident  yeah  the reactor may be toast  which is  you know  sorry for the power company  but we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land. So I really think that in the  say     years it's going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality  this could be the source of energy that provides carbon free electricity. Carbon free electricity. And it's an amazing technology because not only does it combat climate change  but it's an innovation. It's a way to bring power to the developing world  because it's produced in a factory and it's cheap. You can put them anywhere in the world you want to. And maybe something else. As a kid  I was obsessed with space. Well  I was obsessed with nuclear science too  to a point  but before that I was obsessed with space  and I was really excited about  you know  being an astronaut and designing rockets  which was something that was always exciting to me. But I think I get to come back to this  because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket that produces    to     megawatts. That is the rocket designer's dream. That's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet's dream. Not only do you have    to     megawatts to power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there  but you have power once you get there. You know  rocket designers who use solar panels or fuel cells  I mean a few watts or kilowatts    wow  that's a lot of power. I mean  now we're talking about     megawatts. That's a ton of power. That could power a Martian community. That could power a rocket there. And so I hope that maybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore my rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion. And people say   Oh  well  you've launched this thing  and it's radioactive  into space  and what about accidents   But we launch plutonium batteries all the time. Everybody was really excited about Curiosity  and that had this big plutonium battery on board that has plutonium      which actually has a higher specific activity than the low enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors  which means that the effects would be negligible  because you launch it cold  and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor. So I'm really excited. I think that I've designed this reactor here that can be an innovative source of energy  provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications  and I'm really prepared to do this. I graduated high school in May  and    I graduated high school in May  and I decided that I was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that I've developed  these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes  but I want to do this  and I've slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people I've ever had the chance to work with  and I'm really prepared to make this a reality. And I think  I think  that looking at the technology  this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas  and you don't have to refuel it for    years  which is an advantage for the developing world. And I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing to end with  which is weird for a scientist. But I think there's something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars  because the stars are giant fusion reactors. They're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky. The energy that I'm able to talk to you today  while it was converted to chemical energy in my food  originally came from a nuclear reaction  and so there's something poetic about  in my opinion  perfecting nuclear fission and using it as a future source of innovative energy. So thank you guys. I'm not sure that every person here is familiar with my pictures. I want to start to show just a few pictures to you  and after I'll speak. I must speak to you a little bit of my history  because we'll be speaking on this during my speech here. I was born in      in Brazil  in the times that Brazil was not yet a market economy. I was born on a farm  a farm that was more than    percent rainforest  still . A marvelous place. I lived with incredible birds  incredible animals  I swam in our small rivers with our caimans. It was about    families that lived on this farm  and everything that we produced on this farm  we consumed. Very few things went to the market. Once a year  the only thing that went to the market was the cattle that we produced  and we made trips of about    days to reach the slaughterhouse  bringing thousands of head of cattle  and about    days traveling back to reach our farm again. When I was    years old  it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger    much bigger    where I did the second part of secondary school. There I learned different things. Brazil was starting to urbanize  industrialize  and I knew the politics. I became a little bit radical  I was a member of leftist parties  and I became an activist. I  went to  university to become an economist. I  did  a master's degree in economics. And the most important thing in my life also happened in this time. I met an incredible girl who became my lifelong best friend  and my associate in everything that I have done till now  my wife  L lia Wanick Salgado. Brazil radicalized very strongly. We fought very hard against the dictatorship  in a moment it was necessary to us  Either go into clandestinity with weapons in hand  or leave Brazil. We were too young  and our organization thought it was better for us to go out  and we went to France  where I did a PhD in economics  L ila became an architect. I worked after for an investment bank. We made a lot of trips  financed development  economic projects in Africa with the World Bank. And one day photography made a total invasion in my life. I became a photographer  abandoned everything and became a photographer  and I started to do the photography that was important for me. Many people tell me that you are a photojournalist  that you are an anthropologist photographer  that you are an activist photographer. But I did much more than that. I put photography as my life. I lived totally inside photography doing long term projects  and I want to show you just a few pictures of    again  you'll see inside the social projects  that I went to  I published many books on these photographs  but I'll just show you a few ones now. In the '  s  from      to       I photographed a story called Migrations. It became a book. It became a show. But during the time that I was photographing this  I lived through a very hard moment in my life  mostly in Rwanda. I saw in Rwanda total brutality. I saw deaths by thousands per day. I lost my faith in our species. I didn't believe that it was possible for us to live any longer  and I started to be attacked by my own Staphylococcus. I started to have infection everywhere. When I made love with my wife  I had no sperm that came out of me  I had blood. I went to see a friend's doctor in Paris  told him that I was completely sick. He made a long examination  and told me   Sebastian  you are not sick  your prostate is perfect. What happened is  you saw so many deaths that you are dying. You must stop. Stop. You must stop because on the contrary  you will be dead.  And I made the decision to stop. I was really upset with photography  with everything in the world  and I made the decision to go back to where I was born. It was a big coincidence. It was the moment that my parents became very old. I have seven sisters. I'm one of the only men in my family  and they made together the decision to transfer this land to L ila and myself. When we received this land  this land was as dead as I was. When I was a kid  it was more than    percent rainforest. When we received the land  it was less than half a percent rainforest  as in all my region. To build development  Brazilian development  we destroyed a lot of our forest. As you did here in the United States  or you did in India  everywhere in this planet. To build our development  we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything. This farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds  and we didn't know how to deal with these. And L ila came up with an incredible idea  a crazy idea. She said  why don't you put back the rainforest that was here before  You say that you were born in paradise. Let's build the paradise again. And I went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to prepare a project for us  and we started. We started to plant  and this first year we lost a lot of trees  second year less  and slowly  slowly this dead land started to be born again. We started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees  only local species  only native species  where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed  and the life started to come back in an incredible way. It was necessary for us to transform our land into a national park. We transformed. We gave this land back to nature. It became a national park. We created an institution called Instituto Terra  and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere. Here in Los Angeles  in the Bay Area in San Francisco  it became tax deductible in the United States. We raised money in Spain  in Italy  a lot in Brazil. We worked with a lot of companies in Brazil that put money into this project  the government. And the life started to come  and I had a big wish to come back to photography  to photograph again. And this time  my wish was not to photograph anymore just one animal that I had photographed all my life  us. I wished to photograph the other animals  to photograph the landscapes  to photograph us  but us from the beginning  the time we lived in equilibrium with nature. And I went. I started in the beginning of       and I finished at the end of     . We created an incredible amount of pictures  and the result    L lia did the design of all my books  the design of all my shows. She is the creator of the shows. And what we want with these pictures is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet and what we must hold on this planet if we want to live  to have some equilibrium in our life. And I wanted to see us when we used  yes  our instruments in stone. We exist yet. I was last week at the Brazilian National Indian Foundation  and only in the Amazon we have about     groups of Indians that are not contacted yet. We must protect the forest in this sense. And with these pictures  I hope that we can create information  a system of information. We tried to do a new presentation of the planet  and I want to show you now just a few pictures of this project  please. Well  this    Applause    Thank you. Thank you very much. This is what we must fight hard to hold like it is now. But there is another part that we must together rebuild  to build our societies  our modern family of societies  we are at a point where we cannot go back. But we create an incredible contradiction. To build all this  we destroy a lot. Our forest in Brazil  that antique forest that was the size of California  is destroyed today    percent. Here  on the West Coast  you've destroyed your forest. Around here  no  The redwood forests are gone. Gone very fast  disappeared. Coming the other day from Atlanta  here  two days ago  I was flying over deserts that we made  we provoked with our own hands. India has no more trees. Spain has no more trees. And we must rebuild these forests. That is the essence of our life  these forests. We need to breathe. The only factory capable to transform CO  into oxygen  are the forests. The only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing  always  even if we reduce them  everything that we do  we produce CO   are the trees. I put the question    three or four weeks ago  we saw in the newspapers millions of fish that die in Norway. A lack of oxygen in the water. I put to myself the question  if for a moment  we will not lack oxygen for all animal species  ours included    that would be very complicated for us. For the water system  the trees are essential. I'll give you a small example that you'll understand very easily. You happy people that have a lot of hair on your head  if you take a shower  it takes you two or three hours to dry your hair if you don't use a dryer machine. Me  one minute  it's dry. The same with the trees. The trees are the hair of our planet. When you have rain in a place that has no trees  in just a few minutes  the water arrives in the stream  brings soil  destroying our water source  destroying the rivers  and no humidity to retain. When you have trees  the root system holds the water. All the branches of the trees  the leaves that come down create a humid area  and they take months and months under the water  go to the rivers  and maintain our source  maintain our rivers. This is the most important thing  when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life. I want to show you now  to finish  just a few pictures that for me are very important in that direction. You remember that I told you  when I received the farm from my parents that was my paradise  that was the farm. Land completely destroyed  the erosion there  the land had dried. But you can see in this picture  we were starting to construct an educational center that became quite a large environmental center in Brazil. But you see a lot of small spots in this picture. In each point of those spots  we had planted a tree. There are thousands of trees. Now I'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point two months ago. I told you in the beginning that it was necessary for us to plant about  .  million trees of about     different species in order to rebuild the ecosystem. And I'll show you the last picture. We are with two million trees in the ground now. We are doing the sequestration of about         tons of carbon with these trees. My friends  it's very easy to do. We did it  no  By an accident that happened to me  we went back  we built an ecosystem. We here inside the room  I believe that we have the same concern  and the model that we created in Brazil  we can transplant it here. We can apply it everywhere around the world  no  And I believe that we can do it together. Thank you very much. All right  so let's take four subjects that obviously go together  big data  tattoos  immortality and the Greeks. Right  Now  the issue about tattoos is that  without a word  tattoos really do shout.  Beautiful   Intriguing  So you don't have to say a lot.  Allegiance   Very intimate   Serious mistakes  And tattoos tell you a lot of stories. If I can ask an indiscreet question  how many of you have tattoos  A few  but not most. What happens if Facebook  Google  Twitter  LinkedIn  cell phones  GPS  Foursquare  Yelp  Travel Advisor  all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos  And what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would  What's ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are Tweeting  blogging  following you  watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself. And electronic tattoos also shout. And as you're thinking of the consequences of that  it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff  among other things  because it's not just the electronic tattoos  it's facial recognition that's getting really good. So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names  although  again  sometimes it does make mistakes.  Laughter  But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this  take a picture  say  of this guy right here  get the name  and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody  because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos. And so there's companies like face.com that now have about    billion faces online. Here's what happened to this company.  Company sold to Facebook  June         ...  There are other companies that will place a camera like this   this has nothing to do with Facebook   they take your picture  they tie it to the social media  they figure out you really like to wear black dresses  so maybe the person in the store comes up and says   Hey  we've got five black dresses that would just look great on you.  So what if Andy was wrong  Here's Andy's theory.  In the future  everybody will be world famous for    minutes.  What if we flip this  What if you're only going to be anonymous for    minutes   Laughter  Well  then  because of electronic tattoos  maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality  because these tattoos will live far longer than our bodies will. And if that's true  then what we want to do is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks and one lesson from a Latin American. Why the Greeks  Well  the Greeks thought about what happens when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time. So lesson number one  Sisyphus. Remember  He did a horrible thing  condemned for all time to roll this rock up  it would roll back down  roll back up  roll back down. It's a little like your reputation. Once you get that electronic tattoo  you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time  so as you go through this stuff  just be careful what you post. Myth number two  Orpheus  wonderful guy  charming to be around  great partier  great singer  loses his beloved  charms his way into the underworld  only person to charm his way into the underworld  charms the gods of the underworld  they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they're out. So he's walking out and walking out and walking out and he just can't resist. He looks at her  loses her forever. With all this data out here  it might be a good idea not to look too far into the past of those you love. Lesson number three  Atalanta. Greatest runner. She would challenge anybody. If you won  she would marry you. If you lost  you died. How did Hippomenes beat her  Well  he had all these wonderful little golden apples  and she'd run ahead  and he'd roll a little golden apple. She'd run ahead  and he'd roll a little golden apple. She kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race. Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them or tweet about them or send a late night message. And then  of course  there's Narcissus. Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus. But as you're thinking about Narcissus  just don't fall in love with your own reflection. Last lesson  from a Latin American  This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges. When he was threatened by the thugs of the Argentine military junta  he came back and said   Oh  come on  how else can you threaten  other than with death   The interesting thing  the original thing  would be to threaten somebody with immortality. And that  of course  is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos. Thank you. I have spent my entire life either at the schoolhouse  on the way to the schoolhouse  or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse. Both my parents were educators  my maternal grandparents were educators  and for the past    years  I've done the same thing. And so  needless to say  over those years I've had a chance to look at education reform from a lot of perspectives. Some of those reforms have been good. Some of them have been not so good. And we know why kids drop out. We know why kids don't learn. It's either poverty  low attendance  negative peer influences... We know why. But one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection. Relationships. James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship. George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships. Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult. For years  I have watched people teach. I have looked at the best and I've looked at some of the worst. A colleague said to me one time   They don't pay me to like the kids. They pay me to teach a lesson. The kids should learn it. I should teach it  they should learn it  Case closed.  Well  I said to her   You know  kids don't learn from people they don't like.  She said   That's just a bunch of hooey.  And I said to her   Well  your year is going to be long and arduous  dear.  Needless to say  it was. Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship  or you don't. I think Stephen Covey had the right idea. He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things  like seeking first to understand  as opposed to being understood. Simple things  like apologizing. You ever thought about that  Tell a kid you're sorry  they're in shock. I taught a lesson once on ratios. I'm not real good with math  but I was working on it. And I got back and looked at that teacher edition. I'd taught the whole lesson wrong. So I came back to class the next day and I said   Look  guys  I need to apologize. I taught the whole lesson wrong. I'm so sorry.  They said   That's okay  Ms. Pierson. You were so excited  we just let you go.  I have had classes that were so low  so academically deficient  that I cried. I wondered   How am I going to take this group  in nine months  from where they are to where they need to be  And it was difficult  it was awfully hard. How do I raise the self esteem of a child and his academic achievement at the same time  One year I came up with a bright idea. I told all my students   You were chosen to be in my class because I am the best teacher and you are the best students  they put us all together so we could show everybody else how to do it.  One of the students said   Really   I said   Really. We have to show the other classes how to do it  so when we walk down the hall  people will notice us  so you can't make noise. You just have to strut.  And I gave them a saying to say   I am somebody. I was somebody when I came. I'll be a better somebody when I leave. I am powerful  and I am strong. I deserve the education that I get here. I have things to do  people to impress  and places to go.  And they said   Yeah   You say it long enough  it starts to be a part of you. I gave a quiz     questions. A student missed   . I put a      on his paper and a big smiley face. He said   Ms. Pierson  is this an F   I said   Yes.  He said   Then why'd you put a smiley face   I said   Because you're on a roll. You got two right. You didn't miss them all.  I said   And when we review this  won't you do better   He said   Yes  ma'am  I can do better.  You see        sucks all the life out of you.      said   I ain't all bad.  For years  I watched my mother take the time at recess to review  go on home visits in the afternoon  buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat  and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good. See  it's hard to teach kids who stink. And kids can be cruel. And so she kept those things in her desk  and years later  after she retired  I watched some of those same kids come through and say to her   You know  Ms. Walker  you made a difference in my life. You made it work for me. You made me feel like I was somebody  when I knew  at the bottom  I wasn't. And I want you to just see what I've become.  And when my mama died two years ago at     there were so many former students at her funeral  it brought tears to my eyes  not because she was gone  but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear. Can we stand to have more relationships  Absolutely. Will you like all your children  Of course not. And you know your toughest kids are never absent. Never. You won't like them all  and the tough ones show up for a reason. It's the connection. It's the relationships. So teachers become great actors and great actresses  and we come to work when we don't feel like it  and we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense  and we teach anyway. We teach anyway  because that's what we do. Teaching and learning should bring joy. How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks  who were not afraid to think  and who had a champion  Every child deserves a champion  an adult who will never give up on them  who understands the power of connection  and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be. Is this job tough  You betcha. Oh God  you betcha. But it is not impossible. We can do this. We're educators. We're born to make a difference. Thank you so much. In this talk today  I want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment. It's a different idea  because usually  when people talk about early childhood programs  they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of former participants  in preschool  they have better K    test scores  better adult earnings. Now that's all very important  but what I want to talk about is what preschool does for state economies and for promoting state economic development. And that's actually crucial because if we're going to get increased investment in early childhood programs  we need to interest state governments in this. The federal government has a lot on its plate  and state governments are going to have to step up. So we have to appeal to them  the legislators in the state government  and turn to something they understand  that they have to promote the economic development of their state economy. Now  by promoting economic development  I don't mean anything magical. All I mean is  is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state's residents. Now  I think it's fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development  they don't generally think first about what they're doing about childcare and early childhood programs. I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs. I've talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues  a lot of legislators about these issues. When legislators and others think about economic development  what they first of all think about are business tax incentives  property tax abatements  job creation tax credits  you know  there are a million of these programs all over the place. So for example  states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants. They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks. Now  those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions  and the way they can make sense is  by creating more and better jobs  they raise employment rates  raise per capita earnings of state residents. So there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that they're paying by paying for these business tax breaks. My argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do exactly the same thing  create more and better jobs  but in a different way. It's a somewhat more indirect way. These programs can promote more and better jobs by  you build it  you invest in high quality preschool  it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around  and  in turn  that higher quality local workforce will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating higher earnings per capita in the local community. Now  let me turn to some numbers on this. Okay. If you look at the research evidence    that's extensive    on how much early childhood programs affect the educational attainment  wages and skills of former participants in preschool as adults  you take those known effects  you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out  and you take research on how much skills drive job creation  you will conclude  from these three separate lines of research  that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs  the per capita earnings of state residents go up by two dollars and    cents  so that's a three to one return. Now you can get much higher returns  of up to    to one  if you include anti crime benefits  if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state  but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers  and it's the states that are going to have to act. So there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development. Now  one objection you often hear  or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it  is  why should I pay more taxes to invest in other people's children  What's in it for me  And the trouble with that objection  it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent. Specifically  the interdependency here is  is that there are huge spillovers of skills    that when other people's children get more skills  that actually increases the prosperity of everyone  including people whose skills don't change. So for example  numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives the growth rate of metropolitan areas  it's not so much low taxes  low cost  low wages  it's the skills of the area. Particularly  the proxy for skills that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area. So when you look  for example  at metropolitan areas such as the Boston area  Minneapolis St. Paul  Silicon Valley  these areas are not doing well economically because they're low cost. I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley. It's not exactly a low cost proposition. They are growing because they have high levels of skills. So when we invest in other people's children  and build up those skills  we increase the overall job growth of a metro area. As another example  if we look at what determines an individual's wages  and we do statistical exploration of that  what determines wages  we know that the individual's wages will depend  in part  on that individual's education  for example whether or not they have a college degree. One of the very interesting facts is that  in addition  we find that even once we hold constant  statistically  the effect of your own education  the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages. So specifically  if you hold constant your education  you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area  you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all. In fact  this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree  the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects. So if someone gets a college degree  their lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount  over         dollars. There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area  and if you add that up    it's a small effect for each person  but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area  you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars. That's actually greater than the direct benefits of the person choosing to get education. Now  what's going on here  What can explain these huge spillover effects of education  Well  let's think about it this way. I can be the most skilled person in the world  but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills  my employer is going to find it more difficult to introduce new technology  new production techniques. So as a result  my employer is going to be less productive. They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages. Even if everyone at my firm has good skills  if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills  my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets. And again  the firm that's less competitive will not be able to pay as good wages  and then  particularly in high tech businesses  they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses. So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm  but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area. So as a result  if we can invest in other people's children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high quality  we not only help those children  we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth. Another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern about people moving out. So  you know  maybe Ohio's thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in Columbus  Ohio  but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will  for some strange reason  decide to move to Ann Arbor  Michigan  and become Wolverines. And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in Ann Arbor  Michigan  and be worried these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes. And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out. Well  the reality is  if you look at the data  Americans aren't as hyper mobile as people sometimes assume. The data is that over    percent of Americans spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in  over    percent. That percentage does not vary much from state to state. It doesn't vary much with the state's economy  whether it's depressed or booming  it doesn't vary much over time. So the reality is  if you invest in kids  they will stay. Or at least  enough of them will stay that it will pay off for your state economy. Okay  so to sum up  there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs  if run in a high quality way  pay off in higher adult skills. There's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy  and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy  and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar  we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy. So in my opinion  the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling. So what are the barriers to getting it done  Well  one obvious barrier is cost. So if you look at what it would cost if every state government invested in universal preschool at age four  full day preschool at age four  the total annual national cost would be roughly    billion dollars. So     billion dollars is a lot of money. On the other hand  if you reflect on that the U.S.'s population is over     million  we're talking about an amount of money that amounts to     dollars per capita. Okay  A hundred dollars per capita  per person  is something that any state government can afford to do. It's just a simple matter of political will to do it. And  of course  as I mentioned  this cost has corresponding benefits. I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three   .    for the state economy  in terms of over    billion in extra earnings. And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something  what we're talking about is that  for the average low income kid  that would increase earnings by about    percent over their whole career  just doing the preschool  not improving K    or anything else after that  not doing anything with college tuition or access  just directly improving preschool  and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle class kids. So this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state's population and produces large and tangible benefits. Now  that's one barrier. I actually think the more profound barrier is the long term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs. So the argument I'm making is  is that we're increasing the quality of our local workforce  and thereby increasing economic development. Obviously if we have a preschool with four year olds  we're not sending these kids out at age five to work in the sweatshops  right  At least I hope not. So we're talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for    or    years  and of course America is notorious for being a short term oriented society. Now one response you can make to this  and I sometimes have done this in talks  is people can talk about  there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedial education costs  there are benefits  parents care about preschool  maybe we'll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool  and I think those are true  but in some sense they're missing the point. Ultimately  this is something we're investing in now for the future. And so what I want to leave you with is what I think is the ultimate question. I mean  I'm an economist  but this is ultimately not an economic question  it's a moral question  Are we willing  as Americans  are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long term future of not only our kids  but our community  Are we still capable of that as a country  And that's something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves. Is that something that you are still invested in  that you still believe in the notion of investment  That is the notion of investment. You sacrifice now for a return later. So I think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is extremely strong. However  the moral and political choice is still up to us  as citizens and as voters. Thank you very much.  Applause  Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher  one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty  the shape and the form of Chinese characters. Ever since then  I was fascinated by this incredible language. But to an outsider  it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China. Over the past few years  I've been wondering if I can break down this wall  so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so. I started thinking about how a new  fast method of learning Chinese might be useful. Since the age of five  I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence. I learned new characters every day during the course of the next    years. Since we only have five minutes  it's better that we have a fast and simpler way. A Chinese scholar would understand        characters. You only need       to understand the basic literacy. The top     will allow you to comprehend    percent of basic literature    enough to read road signs  restaurant menus  to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers. Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works. You are ready  Open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square. You get a mouth. This is a person going for a walk. Person. If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides  as if she was yelling frantically   Help  I'm on fire      This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame  but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you. This is a tree. Tree. This is a mountain. The sun. The moon. The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. I call these eight characters radicals. They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters. A person. If someone walks behind  that is  to follow.  As the old saying goes  two is company  three is a crowd. If a person stretched their arms wide  this person is saying   It was this big.  The person inside the mouth  the person is trapped. He's a prisoner  just like Jonah inside the whale. One tree is a tree. Two trees together  we have the woods. Three trees together  we create the forest. Put a plank underneath the tree  we have the foundation. Put a mouth on the top of the tree  that's  idiot.   Laughter  Easy to remember  since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. Remember fire  Two fires together  I get really hot. Three fires together  that's a lot of flames. Set the fire underneath the two trees  it's burning. For us  the sun is the source of prosperity. Two suns together  prosperous. Three together  that's sparkles. Put the sun and the moon shining together  it's brightness. It also means tomorrow  after a day and a night. The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise. A door. Put a plank inside the door  it's a door bolt. Put a mouth inside the door  asking questions. Knock knock. Is anyone home  This person is sneaking out of a door  escaping  evading. On the left  we have a woman. Two women together  they have an argument. Three women together  be careful  it's adultery. So we have gone through almost    characters. By using this method  the first eight radicals will allow you to build   . The next group of eight characters will build an extra   . So with very little effort  you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters  which is the same as a Chinese eight year old. So after we know the characters  we start building phrases. For example  the mountain and the fire together  we have fire mountain. It's a volcano. We know Japan is the land of the rising sun. This is a sun placed with the origin  because Japan lies to the east of China. So a sun  origin together  we build Japan. A person behind Japan  what do we get  A Japanese person. The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other. In ancient China  that means in exile  because Chinese emperors  they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains. Nowadays  exile has turned into getting out. A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit. This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage. Thank you. Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player  a tennis player  a gymnast or a bridge player. My bridge coach  Sharon Osberg  says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world.  Laughter  Sorry  Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately  there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better  and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get  we were blown away. Until recently  over    percent of teachers just got one word of feedback  Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was  satisfactory   I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best  How would I know what I was doing differently  Today  districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers  but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students  and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well  unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically  and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top   . We're tied for   th with Iceland and Poland. Now  out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading  how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve  Eleven out of   . The U.S. is tied for   th in reading  but we're   rd in science and   st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top  and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer  the province of Shanghai  China. Now  they rank number one across the board  in reading  math and science  and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups  where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask  why is a system like this so important  It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact  there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers  our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like  Well  to find out  our foundation has been working with       teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example  did they ask their students challenging questions  Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea  We also had students fill out surveys with questions like   Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson    Do you learn to correct your mistakes   And what we found is very exciting. First  the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second  teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools  because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started  we're doing a peer review day  okay  A peer review day  and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston  Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about    I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay  so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video  and there is a lot to be learned from that  and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide angle lens. At the beginning of class  I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right  let's take a look at the long one first  okay  Once I'm finished taping  then I put it in my computer  and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down  I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process  and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management  and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works  what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand  and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan  things you cannot convey in a standard  things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty  everybody  have a great weekend. I'll see you later.  Every classroom could look like that  Bill Gates  One day  we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions  you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example  I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable  but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process  if they collect video in their own classrooms  and they pick the lessons they want to submit  a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number  but to put it in perspective  it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback  as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education  find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding  and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one  too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. I teach chemistry. All right  all right. So more than just explosions  chemistry is everywhere. Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over  Some people nodding yes. Recently  I showed this to my students  and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened. The questions and conversations that followed were fascinating. Check out this video that Maddie from my period three class sent me that evening. Now obviously  as Maddie's chemistry teacher  I love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class. But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity took her to a new level. If you look inside that beaker  you might see a candle. Maddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon to a new scenario. You know  questions and curiosity like Maddie's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers  and they transcend all technology or buzzwords in education. But if we place these technologies before student inquiry  we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers  our students' questions. For example  flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time  but if it is the focus of our students' experience  it's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing. But if instead we have the guts to confuse our students  perplex them  and evoke real questions  through those questions  we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction. So    st century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside  the truth is  I've been teaching for    years now  and it took a life threatening situation to snap me out of    years of pseudo teaching and help me realize that student questions are the seeds of real learning  not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information. In May of       at    years old  with a two year old at home and my second child on the way  I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta. This led to open heart surgery. This is the actual real email from my doctor right there. Now  when I got this  I was    press Caps Lock    absolutely freaked out  okay  But I found surprising moments of comfort in the confidence that my surgeon embodied. Where did this guy get this confidence  the audacity of it  So when I asked him  he told me three things. He said first  his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure  about what worked and what didn't work. Second  he embraced  and didn't fear  the messy process of trial and error  the inevitable process of trial and error. And third  through intense reflection  he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure  and then  with a steady hand  he saved my life. Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom  and before I went back into the classroom that fall  I wrote down three rules of my own that I bring to my lesson planning still today. Rule number one  Curiosity comes first. Questions can be windows to great instruction  but not the other way around. Rule number two  Embrace the mess. We're all teachers. We know learning is ugly. And just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section  .  of chapter one of the one that we all skip  okay  trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room    . And rule number three  Practice reflection. What we do is important. It deserves our care  but it also deserves our revision. Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms  As if what we are doing one day will save lives. Our students our worth it. And each case is different. All right. Sorry. The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that out of my system before we move on. So these are my daughters. On the right we have little Emmalou    Southern family. And  on the left  Riley. Now Riley's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here. She's going to be four years old  and anyone who knows a four year old knows that they love to ask   Why   Yeah. Why. I could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything. We all were at that age. But the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers  the ones she has yet to meet. How will they grow this curiosity  You see  I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids  and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms    to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom. But if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry  we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day  and spark their imagination. Thank you very much. So I grew up in East Los Angeles  not even realizing I was poor. My dad was a high ranking gang member who ran the streets. Everyone knew who I was  so I thought I was a pretty big deal  and I was protected  and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail  I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent. She worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean's office  so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class  for whatever reason  who were waiting to be disciplined. Man  her office was packed. So  see  kids like us  we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school  and sometimes we're just not ready to focus. But that doesn't mean that we can't. It just takes a little bit more. Like  I remember one day I found my dad convulsing  foaming at the mouth  OD ing on the bathroom floor. Really  do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list  Not so much. But I really needed a support network  a group of people who were going to help me make sure that I wasn't going to be a victim of my own circumstance  that they were going to push me beyond what I even thought I could do. I needed teachers  in the classroom  every day  who were going to say   You can move beyond that.  And unfortunately  the local junior high was not going to offer that. It was gang infested  huge teacher turnover rate. So my mom said   You're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day.  So for the next two years  that's what I did. I took a school bus to the fancy side of town. And eventually  I ended up at a school where there was a mixture. There were some people who were really gang affiliated  and then there were those of us really trying to make it to high school. Well  trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable. You had to survive. You just had to do things sometimes. So there were a lot of teachers who were like   She's never going to make it. She has an issue with authority. She's not going to go anywhere.  Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause. But then  they were very surprised when I graduated from high school. I was accepted to Pepperdine University  and I came back to the same school that I attended to be a special ed assistant. And then I told them   I want to be a teacher.  And boy  they were like   What  Why  Why would you want to do that   So I began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that I attended  and I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me. And so every year  I share my background with my kids  because they need to know that everyone has a story  everyone has a struggle  and everyone needs help along the way. And I am going to be their help along the way. So as a rookie teacher  I created opportunity. I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before. I was like   You need to go to a hospital  the school nurse  something.  He's like   No  Miss  I'm not going. I need to be in class because I need to graduate.  So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance  but we were going to push forward and keep moving on. And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they're going through  getting to know their families    I wanted that  but I couldn't do it in a school with       kids  and teachers turning over year after year after year. How do you get to build those relationships  So we created a new school. And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media. And we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding  for support. But with that  we were going to gain freedom  freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective  freedom to control the curriculum so that we're not doing lesson  .  on page five  no  and freedom to control a budget  to spend money where it matters  not how a district or a state says you have to do it. We wanted those freedoms. But now  shifting an entire paradigm  it hasn't been an easy journey  nor is it even complete. But we had to do it. Our community deserved a new way of doing things. And as the very first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District  you better believe there was some opposition. And it was out of fear    fear of  well  what if they get it wrong  Yeah  what if we get it wrong  But what if we get it right  And we did. So even though teachers were against it because we employ one year contracts    you can't teach  or you don't want to teach  you don't get to be at my school with my kids. So in our third year  how did we do it  Well  we're making school worth coming to every day. We make our kids feel like they matter to us. We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them  and they use all the technology that they're used to. Laptops  computers  tablets    you name it  they have it. Animation  software  moviemaking software  they have it all. And because we connect it to what they're doing   For example  they made public service announcements for the Cancer Society. These were played in the local trolley system. Teaching elements of persuasion  it doesn't get any more real than that. Our state test scores have gone up more than    points since we've become our own school. But it's taken all stakeholders  working together    teachers and principals on one year contracts  working over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation. And it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say   Know  the district is trying to impose this  but you have the freedom to do otherwise.  And it takes an active parent center who is not only there  showing a presence every day  but who is part of our governance  making decisions for their kids  our kids. Because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live  They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood  a school that they can be proud to say they attend  and a school that the community can be proud of as well  and they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances. Because it's time that kids like me stop being the exception  and we become the norm. Thank you. I'm a little nervous  because my wife Yvonne said to me  she said   Geoff  you watch the TED Talks.  I said   Yes  honey  I love TED Talks.  She said   You know  they're like  really smart  talented      I said   I know  I know.   Laughter  She said   They don't want  like  the angry black man.  So I said   No  I'm gonna be good  Honey  I'm gonna be good. I am.  But I am angry.  Laughter  And the last time I looked  I'm    So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry. This year  there are going to be millions of our children that we're going to needlessly lose  that we could    right now  we could save them all. You saw the quality of the educators who were here. Do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them. I know they could. It is absolutely possible. Why haven't we fixed this  Those of us in education have held on to a business plan that we don't care how many millions of young people fail  we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work  and nobody is getting crazy about it    right     enough to say   Enough is enough.  So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense. You know  I grew up in the inner city  and there were kids who were failing in schools    years ago when I first went to school  and those schools are still lousy today     years later. And you know something about a lousy school  It's not like a bottle of wine. Right   Laughter  Where you say  like  '   was like a good year  right  That's now how this thing    I mean  every single year  it's still the same approach  right  One size fits all  if you get it  fine  and if you don't  tough luck. Just tough luck. Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen  Do not tell me we can't do better than this. Look  you go into a place that's failed kids for    years  and you say   So what's the plan   And they say   We'll  we're going to do what we did last year this year.  What kind of business model is that  Banks used to open and operate between    and  . They operated    to  . They were closed for lunch hour. Now  who can bank between    and    The unemployed. They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks. Who created that business model  Right  And it went on for decades. You know why  Because they didn't care. It wasn't about the customers. It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them. How could you go to the bank when you were at work  It didn't matter. And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset he can't go to the bank. Go find another bank. They all operate the same way. Right  Now  one day  some crazy banker had an idea. Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work. They might like that. What about a Saturday  What about introducing technology  Now look  I'm a technology fan  but I have to admit to you all I'm a little old. So I was a little slow  and I did not trust technology  and when they first came out with those new contraptions  these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money  I was like   There's no way that machine is going to count that money right. I am never using that  right   So technology has changed. Things have changed. Yet not in education. Why  Why is it that when we had rotary phones  when we were having folks being crippled by polio  that we were teaching the same way then that we're doing right now  And if you come up with a plan to change things  people consider you radical. They will say the worst things about you. I said one day  well  look  if the science says    this is science  not me    that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime    You see where they are in June and say  okay  they're there. You look at them in September  they've gone down. You say  whoo  So I heard about that in '   when I was at the Ed School at Harvard. I said   Oh  wow  this is an important study.  Because it suggests we should do something. Every    years they reproduce the same study. It says exactly the same thing  Poor kids lose ground in the summertime. The system decides you can't run schools in the summer. You know  I always wonder  who makes up those rules  For years I went to    Look  I went the Harvard Ed School. I thought I knew something. They said it was the agrarian calendar  and people had   but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense. I never got that. I never got that  because anyone knows if you farm  you don't plant crops in July and August. You plant them in the spring. So who came up with this idea  Who owns it  Why did we ever do it  Well it just turns out in the     s we did have  schools were open all year. They were open all year  because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day. They didn't have any place for their kids to go. It was a perfect place to have schools. So this is not something that is ordained from the education gods. So why don't we  Why don't we  Because our business has refused to use science. Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying   Look  this works  right  We can do this.  How many places in America are going to change  None. None. Okay  yeah  there are two. All right  Yes  there'll be some place  because some folks will do the right thing. As a profession  we have to stop this. The science is clear. Here's what we know. We know that the problem begins immediately. Right  This idea  zero to three. My wife  Yvonne  and I  we have four kids  three grown ones and a    year old. That's a longer story. With our first kids  we did not know the science about brain development. We didn't know how critical those first three years were. We didn't know what was happening in those young brains. We didn't know the role that language  a stimulus and response  call and response  how important that was in developing those children. We know that now. What are we doing about it  Nothing. Wealthy people know. Educated people know. And their kids have an advantage. Poor people don't know  and we're not doing anything to help them at all. But we know this is critical. Now  you take pre kindergarten. We know it's important for kids. Poor kids need that experience. Nope. Lots of places  it doesn't exist. We know health services matter. You know  we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about  you know  because I'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff  but we do health services  and I have to raise a lot of money. People used to say when they'd come fund us   Geoff  why do you provide these health services   I used to make stuff up. Right  I'd say   Well  you know a child who has cavities is not going to  uh  be able to study as well.  And I had to because I had to raise the money. But now I'm older  and you know what I tell them  You know why I provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts  Because I actually like kids. I actually like kids.  Laughter   Applause  But when they really get pushy  people really get pushy  I say   I do it because you do it for your kid.  And you've never read a study from MIT that says giving your kid dance instruction is going to help them do algebra better  but you will give that kid dance instruction  and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction  and it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids have the same opportunity  It's the floor for these children. So here's the other thing. I'm a tester guy. I believe you need data  you need information  because you work at something  you think it's working  and you find out it's not working. I mean  you're educators. You work  you say  you think you've got it  great  no  And you find out they didn't get it. But here's the problem with testing. The testing that we do    we're going to have our test in New York next week   is in April. You know when we're going to get the results back  Maybe July  maybe June. And the results have great data. They'll tell you Raheem really struggled  couldn't do two digit multiplication    so great data  but you're getting it back after school is over. And so  what do you do  You go on vacation.  Laughter  You come back from vacation. Now you've got all of this test data from last year. You don't look at it. Why would you look at it  You're going to go and teach this year. So how much money did we just spend on all of that  Billions and billions of dollars for data that it's too late to use. I need that data in September. I need that data in November. I need to know you're struggling  and I need to know whether or not what I did corrected that. I need to know that this week. I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late. Because in my older years  I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant. I can predict school scores. You take me to any school. I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling. And you tell me last year    percent of those kids were on grade level. And I say   Okay  what's the plan  what did we do from last year to this year   You say   We're doing the same thing.  I'm going to make a prediction.  Laughter  This year  somewhere between    and    percent of those kids will be on grade level. And I will be right every single time. So we're spending all of this money  but we're getting what  Teachers need real information right now about what's happening to their kids. The high stakes is today  because you can do something about it. So here's the other issue that I just think we've got to be concerned about. We can't stifle innovation in our business. We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation. They get angry if you do something different. If you try something new  people are always like   Ooh  charter schools.  Hey  let's try some stuff. Let's see. This stuff hasn't worked for    years. Let's try something different. And here's the rub. Some of it's not going to work. You know  people tell me   Yeah  those charter schools  a lot of them don't work.  A lot of them don't. They should be closed. I mean  I really believe they should be closed. But we can't confuse figuring out the science and things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything. Right  Because that's not the way the world works. If you think about technology  imagine if that's how we thought about technology. Every time something didn't work  we just threw in the towel and said   Let's forget it.  Right  You know  they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me    the latest and greatest thing  the PalmPilot. They told me   Geoff  if you get this PalmPilot you'll never need another thing.  That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over. I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing. Did anybody stop inventing  Not a person. Not a soul. The folks went out there. They kept inventing. The fact that you have failure  that shouldn't stop you from pushing the science forward. Our job as educators  there's some stuff we know that we can do. And we've got to do better. The evaluation  we have to start with kids earlier  we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people. We've got to give them all of these opportunities. So that we have to do. But this innovation issue  this idea that we've got to keep innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical. And this is something  by the way  that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field. America cannot wait another    years to get this right. We have run out of time. I don't know about a fiscal cliff  but I know there's an educational cliff that we are walking over right this very second  and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness about saying we can't afford this   So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars. What is five billion dollars to the United States  What did we spend in Afghanistan this year  How many trillions   Applause  When the country cares about something  we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye. When the safety of America is threatened  we will spend any amount of money. The real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about. I dare say it's a pittance  what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems. So once we do that  I'll no longer be angry.  Laughter  So  you guys  help me get there. Thank you all very much. Thank you. John Legend  So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone  Geoffrey Canada  Well  you know  John      percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school. A hundred percent of them went to college. This year's seniors will have     percent graduating high school. Last I heard we had    percent accepted to college. We'd better get that other seven percent. So that's just how this goes.  Applause  JL  So how do you stick with them after they leave high school  GC  Well  you know  one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids  the same kids  these same vulnerable kids  when you get them in school  they drop out in record numbers. And so we've figured out that you've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does. They harass you  right  They call you  they say   I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test  What are you talking about that you want to leave school  And you're not coming back here.  So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem because Geoff is looking for you. They're like   I really can't come back.  No. You'd better stay in school. But I'm not kidding about some of this  and it gets a little bit to the grit issue. When kids know that you refuse to let them fail  it puts a different pressure on them  and they don't give up as easy. So sometimes they don't have it inside  and they're  like   You know  I don't want to do this  but I know my mother's going to be mad.  Well  that matters to kids  and it helps get them through. We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support  but also a set of encouragements that say to them   You can do it. It is going to be hard  but we refuse to let you fail.  JL  Well  thank you Dr. Canada. Please give it up for him one more time. When I was    years old  I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding  teaching. I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher  I made quizzes and tests. I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back  I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking. The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math  sure  they're hard  ratios  decimals  the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible  and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching  I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective  from a psychological perspective. In education  the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily  So I left the classroom  and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings  and in every study my question was  who is successful here and why  My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods  asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year  and of those  who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students  We partnered with private companies  asking  which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs  And who's going to earn the most money  In all those very different contexts  one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks  physical health  and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future  day in  day out  not just for the week  not just for the month  but for years  and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon  not a sprint. A few years ago  I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires  and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate  even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure  things like family income  standardized achievement test scores  even how safe kids felt when they were at school. So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school  especially for kids at risk for dropping out. To me  the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know  how little science knows  about building it. Every day  parents and teachers ask me   How do I build grit in kids  What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic  How do I keep them motivated for the long run   The honest answer is  I don't know. What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. In fact  in our data  grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. So far  the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called  growth mindset.  This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck  and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed  that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge  they're much more likely to persevere when they fail  because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit. But we need more. And that's where I'm going to end my remarks  because that's where we are. That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas  our strongest intuitions  and we need to test them. We need to measure whether we've been successful  and we have to be willing to fail  to be wrong  to start over again with lessons learned. In other words  we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you. Thank you very much. I moved to America    years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids. Actually  truthfully  we moved to Los Angeles    thinking we were moving to America  but anyway    It's a short plane ride from Los Angeles to America. I got here    years ago  and when I got here  I was told various things  like   Americans don't get irony.  Have you come across this idea  It's not true. I've traveled the whole length and breadth of this country. I have found no evidence that Americans don't get irony. It's one of those cultural myths  like   The British are reserved.  I don't know why people think this. We've invaded every country we've encountered. But it's not true Americans don't get irony  but I just want you to know that that's what people are saying about you behind your back. You know  so when you leave living rooms in Europe  people say  thankfully  nobody was ironic in your presence. But I knew that Americans get irony when I came across that legislation   No Child Left Behind.  Because whoever thought of that title gets irony. Don't they  Because it's leaving millions of children behind. Now I can see that's not a very attractive name for legislation   Millions of Children Left Behind.  I can see that. What's the plan  We propose to leave millions of children behind  and here's how it's going to work. And it's working beautifully. In some parts of the country     percent of kids drop out of high school. In the Native American communities  it's    percent of kids. If we halved that number  one estimate is it would create a net gain to the U.S. economy over    years  of nearly a trillion dollars. From an economic point of view  this is good math  isn't it  that we should do this  It actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis. But the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg. What it doesn't count are all the kids who are in school but being disengaged from it  who don't enjoy it  who don't get any real benefit from it. And the reason is not that we're not spending enough money. America spends more money on education than most other countries. Class sizes are smaller than in many countries. And there are hundreds of initiatives every year to try and improve education. The trouble is  it's all going in the wrong direction. There are three principles on which human life flourishes  and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure. The first is this  that human beings are naturally different and diverse. Can I ask you  how many of you have got children of your own  Okay. Or grandchildren. How about two children or more  Right. And the rest of you have seen such children. Small people wandering about. I will make you a bet  and I am confident that I will win the bet. If you've got two children or more  I bet you they are completely different from each other. Aren't they  You would never confuse them  would you  Like   Which one are you  Remind me.   Your mother and I need some color coding system so we don't get confused.  Education under  No Child Left Behind  is based on not diversity but conformity. What schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement. One of the effects of  No Child Left Behind  has been to narrow the focus onto the so called STEM disciplines. They're very important. I'm not here to argue against science and math. On the contrary  they're necessary but they're not sufficient. A real education has to give equal weight to the arts  the humanities  to physical education. An awful lot of kids  sorry  thank you    One estimate in America currently is that something like    percent of kids  getting on that way  are being diagnosed with various conditions under the broad title of attention deficit disorder. ADHD. I'm not saying there's no such thing. I just don't believe it's an epidemic like this. If you sit kids down  hour after hour  doing low grade clerical work  don't be surprised if they start to fidget  you know  Children are not  for the most part  suffering from a psychological condition. They're suffering from childhood. And I know this because I spent my early life as a child. I went through the whole thing. Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents  not just a small range of them. And by the way  the arts aren't just important because they improve math scores. They're important because they speak to parts of children's being which are otherwise untouched. The second  thank you    The second principle that drives human life flourishing is curiosity. If you can light the spark of curiosity in a child  they will learn without any further assistance  very often. Children are natural learners. It's a real achievement to put that particular ability out  or to stifle it. Curiosity is the engine of achievement. Now the reason I say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here  if I can say so  has been to de professionalize teachers. There is no system in the world or any school in the country that is better than its teachers. Teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools. But teaching is a creative profession. Teaching  properly conceived  is not a delivery system. You know  you're not there just to pass on received information. Great teachers do that  but what great teachers also do is mentor  stimulate  provoke  engage. You see  in the end  education is about learning. If there's no learning going on  there's no education going on. And people can spend an awful lot of time discussing education without ever discussing learning. The whole point of education is to get people to learn. An old friend of mine    actually very old  he's dead. That's as old as it gets  I'm afraid. But a wonderful guy he was  wonderful philosopher. He used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of verbs. You can be engaged in the activity of something  but not really be achieving it  like dieting. It's a very good example. There he is. He's dieting. Is he losing any weight  Not really. Teaching is a word like that. You can say   There's Deborah  she's in room     she's teaching.  But if nobody's learning anything  she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it. The role of a teacher is to facilitate learning. That's it. And part of the problem is  I think  that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning  but testing. Now  testing is important. Standardized tests have a place. But they should not be the dominant culture of education. They should be diagnostic. They should help. If I go for a medical examination  I want some standardized tests. I do. I want to know what my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else's on a standard scale. I don't want to be told on some scale my doctor invented in the car.  Your cholesterol is what I call Level Orange.   Really    Is that good    We don't know.  But all that should support learning. It shouldn't obstruct it  which of course it often does. So in place of curiosity  what we have is a culture of compliance. Our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity. And the third principle is this  that human life is inherently creative. It's why we all have different r sum s. We create our lives  and we can recreate them as we go through them. It's the common currency of being a human being. It's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic. I mean  other animals may well have imaginations and creativity  but it's not so much in evidence  is it  as ours  I mean  you may have a dog. And your dog may get depressed. You know  but it doesn't listen to Radiohead  does it  And sit staring out the window with a bottle of Jack Daniels.  Would you like to come for a walk    No  I'm fine.   You go. I'll wait. But take pictures.  We all create our own lives through this restless process of imagining alternatives and possibilities  and one of the roles of education is to awaken and develop these powers of creativity. Instead  what we have is a culture of standardization. Now  it doesn't have to be that way. It really doesn't. Finland regularly comes out on top in math  science and reading. Now  we only know that's what they do well at  because that's all that's being tested. That's one of the problems of the test. They don't look for other things that matter just as much. The thing about work in Finland is this  they don't obsess about those disciplines. They have a very broad approach to education  which includes humanities  physical education  the arts. Second  there is no standardized testing in Finland. I mean  there's a bit  but it's not what gets people up in the morning  what keeps them at their desks. The third thing    and I was at a meeting recently with some people from Finland  actual Finnish people  and somebody from the American system was saying to the people in Finland   What do you do about the drop out rate in Finland   And they all looked a bit bemused  and said   Well  we don't have one. Why would you drop out  If people are in trouble  we get to them quite quickly and we help and support them.  Now people always say   Well  you know  you can't compare Finland to America.  No. I think there's a population of around five million in Finland. But you can compare it to a state in America. Many states in America have fewer people in them than that. I mean  I've been to some states in America and I was the only person there. Really. Really. I was asked to lock up when I left. But what all the high performing systems in the world do is currently what is not evident  sadly  across the systems in America    I mean  as a whole. One is this  they individualize teaching and learning. They recognize that it's students who are learning and the system has to engage them  their curiosity  their individuality  and their creativity. That's how you get them to learn. The second is that they attribute a very high status to the teaching profession. They recognize that you can't improve education if you don't pick great people to teach and keep giving them constant support and professional development. Investing in professional development is not a cost. It's an investment  and every other country that's succeeding well knows that  whether it's Australia  Canada  South Korea  Singapore  Hong Kong or Shanghai. They know that to be the case. And the third is  they devolve responsibility to the school level for getting the job done. You see  there's a big difference here between going into a mode of command and control in education    That's what happens in some systems. Central or state governments decide  they know best and they're going to tell you what to do. The trouble is that education doesn't go on in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings. It happens in classrooms and schools  and the people who do it are the teachers and the students  and if you remove their discretion  it stops working. You have to put it back to the people. There is wonderful work happening in this country. But I have to say it's happening in spite of the dominant culture of education  not because of it. It's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time. And the reason I think is this  that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions of education. It's like education is an industrial process that can be improved just by having better data  and somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we fine tune it well enough  if we just get it right  it will all hum along perfectly into the future. It won't  and it never did. The point is that education is not a mechanical system. It's a human system. It's about people  people who either do want to learn or don't want to learn. Every student who drops out of school has a reason for it which is rooted in their own biography. They may find it boring. They may find it irrelevant. They may find that it's at odds with the life they're living outside of school. There are trends  but the stories are always unique. I was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of    they're called alternative education programs. These are programs designed to get kids back into education. They have certain common features. They're very personalized. They have strong support for the teachers  close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum  and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school. And they work. What's interesting to me is  these are called  alternative education.  You know  And all the evidence from around the world is  if we all did that  there'd be no need for the alternative. So I think we have to embrace a different metaphor. We have to recognize that it's a human system  and there are conditions under which people thrive  and conditions under which they don't. We are after all organic creatures  and the culture of the school is absolutely essential. Culture is an organic term  isn't it  Not far from where I live is a place called Death Valley. Death Valley is the hottest  driest place in America  and nothing grows there. Nothing grows there because it doesn't rain. Hence  Death Valley. In the winter of       it rained in Death Valley. Seven inches of rain fell over a very short period. And in the spring of       there was a phenomenon. The whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while. What it proved is this  that Death Valley isn't dead. It's dormant. Right beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility waiting for the right conditions to come about  and with organic systems  if the conditions are right  life is inevitable. It happens all the time. You take an area  a school  a district  you change the conditions  give people a different sense of possibility  a different set of expectations  a broader range of opportunities  you cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners  you offer people the discretion to be creative and to innovate in what they do  and schools that were once bereft spring to life. Great leaders know that. The real role of leadership in education    and I think it's true at the national level  the state level  at the school level    is not and should not be command and control. The real role of leadership is climate control  creating a climate of possibility. And if you do that  people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and couldn't have expected. There's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin.  There are three sorts of people in the world  Those who are immovable  people who don't get it  or don't want to do anything about it  there are people who are movable  people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it  and there are people who move  people who make things happen.  And if we can encourage more people  that will be a movement. And if the movement is strong enough  that's  in the best sense of the word  a revolution. And that's what we need. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. When I was in my   s  I saw my very first psychotherapy client. I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley. She was a    year old woman named Alex. Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top  and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems. Now when I heard this  I was so relieved. My classmate got an arsonist for her first client. And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys. This I thought I could handle. But I didn't handle it. With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session  it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road.  Thirty's the new      Alex would say  and as far as I could tell  she was right. Work happened later  marriage happened later  kids happened later  even death happened later. Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time. But before long  my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life. I pushed back. I said   Sure  she's dating down  she's sleeping with a knucklehead  but it's not like she's going to marry the guy.  And then my supervisor said   Not yet  but she might marry the next one. Besides  the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before she has one.  That's what psychologists call an  Aha   moment. That was the moment I realized     is not the new   . Yes  people settle down later than they used to  but that didn't make Alex's   s a developmental downtime. That made Alex's   s a developmental sweet spot  and we were sitting there  blowing it. That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem  and it had real consequences  not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere. There are    million twentysomethings in the United States right now. We're talking about    percent of the population  or     percent if you consider that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their   s first. Raise your hand if you're in your   s. I really want to see some twentysomethings here. Oh  yay  You are all awesome. If you work with twentysomethings  you love a twentysomething  you're losing sleep over twentysomethings  I want to see   Okay. Awesome  twentysomethings really matter. So  I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe that every single one of those    million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists  sociologists  neurologists and fertility specialists already know  that claiming your   s is one of the simplest  yet most transformative  things you can do for work  for love  for your happiness  maybe even for the world. This is not my opinion. These are the facts. We know that    percent of life's most defining moments take place by age   . That means that eight out of    of the decisions and experiences and  Aha   moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid   s. People who are over     don't panic. This crowd is going to be fine  I think. We know that the first    years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn. We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by   . We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your   s as it rewires itself for adulthood  which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself  now is the time to change it. We know that personality changes more during your   s than at any other time in life  and we know that female fertility peaks at age     and things get tricky after age   . So your   s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options. So when we think about child development  we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain. It's a time when your ordinary  day to day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become. But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing as adult development  and our   s are that critical period of adult development. But this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing. Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood. Researchers call the   s an extended adolescence. Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like  twixters  and  kidults.  As a culture  we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood. Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things  you need a plan and not quite enough time. So what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say   You have    extra years to start your life   Nothing happens. You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition  and absolutely nothing happens. And then every day  smart  interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this   I know my boyfriend's no good for me  but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time.  Or they say   Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I'm     I'll be fine.  But then it starts to sound like this   My   s are almost over  and I have nothing to show for myself. I had a better r sum  the day after I graduated from college.  And then it starts to sound like this   Dating in my   s was like musical chairs. Everybody was running around and having fun  but then sometime around    it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down. I didn't want to be the only one left standing up  so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at   .  Where are the twentysomethings here  Do not do that. Okay  now that sounds a little flip  but make no mistake  the stakes are very high. When a lot has been pushed to your   s  there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump start a career  pick a city  partner up  and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time. Many of these things are incompatible  and as research is just starting to show  simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our   s. The post millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car. It's realizing you can't have that career you now want. It's realizing you can't have that child you now want  or you can't give your child a sibling. Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves  and at me  sitting across the room  and say about their   s   What was I doing  What was I thinking   I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking. Here's a story about how that can go. It's a story about a woman named Emma. At     Emma came to my office because she was  in her words  having an identity crisis. She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment  but she hadn't decided yet  so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead. Because it was cheaper  she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition. And as hard as her   s were  her early life had been even harder. She often cried in our sessions  but then would collect herself by saying   You can't pick your family  but you can pick your friends.  Well one day  Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap  and she sobbed for most of the hour. She'd just bought a new address book  and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts  but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words  In case of emergency  please call ...  She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said   Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck  Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer   Now in that moment  it took everything I had not to say   I will.  But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really  really cared. Emma needed a better life  and I knew this was her chance. I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emma's defining decade went parading by. So over the next weeks and months  I told Emma three things that every twentysomething  male or female  deserves to hear. First  I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital. By  get identity capital   I mean do something that adds value to who you are. Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next. I didn't know the future of Emma's career  and no one knows the future of work  but I do know this  Identity capital begets identity capital. So now is the time for that cross country job  that internship  that startup you want to try. I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here  but I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count  which  by the way  is not exploration. That's procrastination. I told Emma to explore work and make it count. Second  I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated. Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport  but twentysomethings who huddle together with like minded peers limit who they know  what they know  how they think  how they speak  and where they work. That new piece of capital  that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle. New things come from what are called our weak ties  our friends of friends of friends. So yes  half of twentysomethings are un  or under employed. But half aren't  and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group. Half of new jobs are never posted  so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job. It's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads. Last but not least  Emma believed that you can't pick your family  but you can pick your friends. Now this was true for her growing up  but as a twentysomething  soon Emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own. I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now. Now you may be thinking that    is actually a better time to settle down than     or even     and I agree with you. But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress. The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one  and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work. Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you. So what happened to Emma  Well  we went through that address book  and she found an old roommate's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state. That weak tie helped her get a job there. That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live in boyfriend. Now  five years later  she's a special events planner for museums. She's married to a man she mindfully chose. She loves her new career  she loves her new family  and she sent me a card that said   Now the emergency contact blanks don't seem big enough.  Now Emma's story made that sound easy  but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings. They are so easy to help. Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX  bound for somewhere west. Right after takeoff  a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji. Likewise  at    or    or even     one good conversation  one good break  one good TED Talk  can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come. So here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know. It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex. It's what I now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day  Thirty is not the new     so claim your adulthood  get some identity capital  use your weak ties  pick your family. Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do. You're deciding your life right now. Thank you.  Don't talk to strangers.  You have heard that phrase uttered by your friends  family  schools and the media for decades. It's a norm. It's a social norm. But it's a special kind of social norm  because it's a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to.  Don't talk to strangers  says   Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you. Stick with the people you know. Stick with people like you.  How appealing is that  It's not really what we do  is it  when we're at our best  When we're at our best  we reach out to people who are not like us  because when we do that  we learn from people who are not like us. My phrase for this value of being with  not like us  is  strangeness   and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world  strangers are quite frankly not the point. The point that we should be worried about is  how much strangeness are we getting  Why strangeness  Because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data  and data turns our social relations into digital relations  and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness  a sense of discovery  a sense of surprise and unpredictability. Why not strangers  Because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries. They belong to a world of people I know versus people I don't know  and in the context of my digital relations  I'm already doing things with people I don't know. The question isn't whether or not I know you. The question is  what can I do with you  What can I learn with you  What can we do together that benefits us both  I spend a lot of time thinking about how the social landscape is changing  how new technologies create new constraints and new opportunities for people. The most important changes facing us today have to do with data and what data is doing to shape the kinds of digital relations that will be possible for us in the future. The economies of the future depend on that. Our social lives in the future depend on that. The threat to worry about isn't strangers. The threat to worry about is whether or not we're getting our fair share of strangeness. Now    th century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers  but they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations  and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices. Stanley Milgram from the '  s and '  s  the creator of the small world experiments  which became later popularized as six degrees of separation  made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps. His point was that strangers are out there. We can reach them. There are paths that enable us to reach them. Mark Granovetter  Stanford sociologist  in      in his seminal essay  The Strength of Weak Ties   made the point that these weak ties that are a part of our networks  these strangers  are actually more effective at diffusing information to us than are our strong ties  the people closest to us. He makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us  these strong ties in our lives  actually have a homogenizing effect on us. They produce sameness. My colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives  what kinds of new routines are possible. We've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms that have enabled us to take our possessions  those things that used to be very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses  and to make them available to people we don't know. Whether it's our clothes  whether it's our cars  whether it's our bikes  whether it's our books or music  we are able to take our possessions now and make them available to people we've never met. And we concluded a very important insight  which was that as people's relationships to the things in their lives change  so do their relations with other people. And yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat. It continues to try to predict what I need based on some past characterization of who I am  of what I've already done. Security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks  keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations. Categories like  friends  and  family  and  contacts  and  colleagues  don't tell me anything about my actual relations. A more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance  where at any given point in time  with any single person  I am both close and distant from that individual  all as a function of what I need to do right now. People aren't close or distant. People are always a combination of the two  and that combination is constantly changing. What if technologies could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships  What if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that I need right now  Strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that I need right now  that enables me to find the sources of intimacy  of discovery  and of inspiration that I need right now. Strangeness is not about meeting strangers. It simply makes the point that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity. So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness  and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today  but also by organizations  organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities. Whether you're a political party insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not  whether you're the government protecting social institutions like marriage and restricting access of those institutions to the few  whether you're a teenager in her bedroom who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents  strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way to new kinds of relations. We have to change the norms. We have to change the norms in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses. What interesting questions lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers  How might we think differently about our relations with people  How might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people  How might we think differently about our relations with technologies  things that effectively become social participants in their own right  The range of digital relations is extraordinary. In the context of this broad range of digital relations  safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation. Thank you. Liu Bolin  By making myself invisible  I try to question the inter canceling relationship between our civilization and its development. Interpreter  By making myself invisible  I try to explore and question the contradictory and often inter canceling relationship between our civilization and its development. LB  This is my first work  created in November     . And this is Beijing International Art Camp where I worked before the government forcibly demolished it.I used this work to express my objection. I also want to use this work to let more people pay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom. In the meantime  from the beginning  this series has a protesting  reflective and uncompromising spirit. When applying makeup  I borrow a sniper's method to better protect myself and to detect the enemy  as he did.  Laughter  After finishing this series of protests  I started questioning why my fate was like this  and I realized that it's not just me    all Chinese are as confused as I am. As you can see  these works are about family planning  election in accordance with the law and propaganda of the institution of the People's Congress. This work is called Xia Gang   leaving post  .  Xia Gang  is a Chinese euphemism for  laid off . It refers to those people who lost their jobs during China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy. From      to         .   million people lost their jobs in China. The six people in the photo are Xia Gang workers. I made them invisible in the deserted shop wherethey had lived and worked all their lives. On the wall behind them is the slogan of the Cultural Revolution   The core force leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party.  For half a month I looked for these   people to participate in my work. We can only see six men in this picture but in fact  those who are hidden here are all people who were laid off. They have just been made invisible. This piece is called The Studio. This spring  I happened to have an opportunity during my solo exhibition in Paris to shoot a work in the news studio of France      I picked the news photos of the day. One is about the war in the Middle East  and another one is about a public demonstration in France. I found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions. This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR. Interpreter  This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR. LB  I tried to disappear into JR's eye  but the problem is JR only uses models with big eyes. So I tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers. But still they are not big enough for JR  unfortunately. Interpreter  So I tried to disappear into JR's eye  but the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes. So I tried to make my eyes bigger with this gesture. But it doesn't work  my eyes are still small. LB  This one is about      memories. This is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the Hudson River. Kenny Scharf's graffiti. This is Venice  Italy. Because global temperatures rise  the sea level rises  and it is said thatVenice will disappear in the coming decades. This is the ancient city of Pompeii. Interpreter  This is the ancient city of Pompeii. LB  This is the Borghese Gallery in Rome. When I work on a new piece  I pay more attention to the expression of ideas. For instance  why would I make myself invisible  What will making myself invisible here cause people to think  This one is called Instant Noodles. Interpreter  This one is called Instant Noodles.  Laughter  LB  Since August       harmful phosphors have been found in the instant noodle package cups from every famous brand sold in China's supermarkets. These phosphors can even cause cancer. To create this artwork  I bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups and put them in my studio  making it look like a supermarket. And my task is to stand there  trying to be still  setting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant and drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body on the front of my body. If the background is simple  I usually have to stand for three to four hours. The background of this piece is more complex  so I need three to four days in advance for preparation. This is the suit I wore when I did the supermarket shoot. There is no Photoshop involved. Interpreter  This is the suit I  was  wearing when I did the supermarket shoot. There is no Photoshop involved.  Laughter  LB  These works are on China's cultural memories. And this one  this is about food safety in China. Unsafe food can harm people's health  and a deluge of magazines can confuse people's minds.  Laughter  The next pieces of work show how I made myself invisible in magazines of different languages  in different countries and at different times. I think that in art  an artist's attitude is the most important element. If an artwork is to touch someone  it must be the result of not only technique  but also the artist's thinking and struggle in life. And the repeated struggles in life create artwork  no matter in what form. That's all I want to say. Thank you.  Applause  Hey guys. It's funny  someone just mentioned MacGyver  because that was  like  I loved it  and when I was seven  I taped a fork to a drill and I was like   Hey  Mom  I'm going to Olive Garden.  And     Drilling noise   Laughter  And it worked really well there. And you know  it had a profound effect on me. It sounds silly  but I thought  okay  the way the world works can be changed  and it can be changed by me in these small ways. And my relationship to especially human made objects which someone else said they work like this  well  I can say they work a different way  a little bit. And so  about    years later  I didn't realize the full effect of this  but I went to Costa Rica and I stayed with these Guaym  natives there  and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them  and they could make beds out of trees  and they could    I watched this woman for three days. I was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart  these little threads off of it  and she'd roll the threads together and make little thicker threads  like strings  and she would weave the strings together  and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days  the materiality of the way the world works  of reality  kind of started to unravel in my mind  because I realized that this bag and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener  everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to  maybe a more complicated one  but still  everything was made that way. And so I had to start studying  who is it that's making these decisions  Who's making these things  How did they make them  What stops us from making them  Because this is how reality is created. So I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab  and I was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity. And I started in nature  because I saw these Guaym s doing it in nature  and there just seems to be less barriers. So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp  where there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out and willing to try anything. So I said   Let's go into the woods near this stream and just put stuff together  you know  make something  I don't care  geometrical shapes  just grab some junk from around you. We won't bring anything with us. And  like  within minutes  this is very easy for adults and teens to do. Here's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream  and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together. A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass. The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it. And after about    minutes  you get really intricate projects like leaves sorted by hue  so you get a color fade and put in a circle like a wreath. And the creator of this  he said   This is fire. I call this fire.  And someone asked him   How do you get those sticks to stay on that tree   And he's like   I don't know  but I can show you.  And I'm like   Wow  that's really amazing. He doesn't know  but he can show you.  So his hands know and his intuition knows  but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be  especially when it comes to the human made  human built world. We think we already know how something works  so we can't imagine how it could work. We know how it's supposed to work  so we can't suppose all the things that could be possible. So kids don't have as hard of a time with this  and I saw in my own son  I gave him this book. I'm a good hippie dad  so I'm like   Okay  you're going to learn to love the moon. I'm going to give you some building blocks and they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks  so it's totally legit.  But he doesn't really know what to do with these. I didn't show him. And so he's like   Okay  I'll just mess around with this.  This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest. Just going to try to put them in shapes and push on them and stuff. And before long  he's kind of got this mechanism where you can almost launch and catapult objects around  and he enlists us in helping him. And at this point  I'm starting to wonder  what kind of tools can we give people  especially adults  who know too much  so that they can see the world as malleable  so they see themselves as agents of change in their everyday lives. Because the most advanced scientists are really just kind of pushing the way the world itself works  pushing what matter can do  the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium  and any sufficiently complicated task  whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child    anything that's complicated    comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it  and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say   Okay  well we're just going to have to refigure this. I don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing. I'm going to use them a different way.  So let me show you a little demo. This is a little piano circuit right in here  and this is an ordinary paintbrush that I smashed it together with.  Beeping  And so  with some ketchup     musical notes    and then I can kind of    musical notes    And that's awesome  right  But this is not what's awesome. What's awesome is what happens when you give the piano circuit to people. A pencil is not just a pencil. Look what it has in the middle of it. That's a wire running down the middle  and not only is it a wire  if you take that piano circuit  you can thumbtack into the middle of a pencil  and you can lay out wire on the page  too  and get electrical current to run through it. And so you can kind of hack a pencil  just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit. And the electricity runs through your body too. And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil. You can make one of these brushes just on the fly. All you do is connect to the bristles  and the bristles are wet  so they conduct  and the person's body conducts  and leather is great to paint on  and then you can start hooking to everything  even the kitchen sink. The metal in the sink is conductive. Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin. And you can even hook to the trees. Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive  and you can use those together. So    Laughter    I took this to those same teens  because those teens are really awesome  and they'll try things that I won't try. I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to. And this young woman  she made what she called a hula looper  and as the hula hoop traveled around her body  she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there. You can see her pointing to it in the picture. And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body  it would connect two little pieces of copper tape  and it would make a sound  and the next sound  and it would loop the same sounds over and over again. I ran these workshops everywhere. In Taiwan  at an art museum  this    year old girl made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan and some electrical tape and hot glue. And professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it. And big companies like Intel or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump  were inviting me to give workshops  just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together. And then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics  but let's just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over. And so I just want to do a quick demo. So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit  and I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you. So I'll just plug it in  and now it's on by USB. And I'll just hook up the forward arrow. You guys are facing that way  so I'll hook it to this one. And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it. And now  if I touch this piece of pizza  the slides that I showed you before should go forward. And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow  I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up  now I have a left arrow and a right arrow  so I should be able to go forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards. Awesome. And so we're like   We gotta put a video out about this.  Because no one really believed that this was important or meaningful except me and  like  one other guy. So we made a video to prove that there's lots of stuff you can do. You can kind of sketch with Play Doh and just Google for game controllers. Just ordinary Play Doh  nothing special. And you can literally draw joysticks and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up.  Video game noises  And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target  Well  if you take those out  they hold water great  but you can totally cut your toes  so yeah  just be careful. You know the Happiness Project  where the experts are setting up the piano stairs  and how cool that is  Well  I think it's cool  but we should be doing that stuff ourselves. It shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works. We should all be participating in changing the way the world works together. Aluminum foil. Everybody has a cat. Get a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS. Hover the mouse over the  take a photo  button  and you've got a little cat photo booth. And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this. If hundreds of people didn't buy this  we couldn't put it on the market. And so we put it up on Kickstarter  and hundreds of people bought it in the first day. And then    days later         people had backed the project. And then what the best part is  we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it. So this is  The Star Spangled Banner  by eating lunch  including drinking Listerine. And we actually sent this guy materials. We're like   We're sponsoring you  man. You're  like  a pro maker.  Okay  just wait for this one. This is good. And these guys at the exploratorium are playing house plants as if they were drums. And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways. And then this brother    look at this diagram. See where it says  sister   I love when people put humans on the diagram. I always add humans to any technical    if you're drawing a technical diagram  put a human in it. And this kid is so sweet. He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister so that on her birthday  she could be the star of the show  jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides. And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano. And this is fun  and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun  But it's also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up  where people can't use computers  necessarily. Like this dad who wrote us  his son has cerebral palsy and he can't use a normal keyboard. And so his dad couldn't necessarily afford to buy all these custom controllers. And so  with the MaKey MaKey  he planned to make these gloves to allow him to navigate the web. And a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came  and we're really excited about that. We didn't plan for that at all. And then all these professional musicians started using it  like at Coachella  just this weekend Jurassic   was using this onstage  and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn  right around here  and he put this up last month. And I love the carrot on the turntable. Most people cannot play them that way.  Laughter  And when this started to get serious  I thought  I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in  because otherwise people are going to be getting this and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change  and governments will be crumbling  and I wouldn't have told people  so I thought I'd better warn them. And I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid of the box  it says   The world is a construction kit.  And as you start to mess around this way  I think that  in some small ways  you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with  and a little bit more like you could participate in designing the future of the way the world works. And so next time you're on an escalator and you drop an M M by accident  you know  maybe that's an M M surfboard  not an escalator  so don't pick it up right away. Maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets and throw it down  and maybe some chapstick  whatever. I used to want to design a utopian society or a perfect world or something like that. But as I'm kind of getting older and kind of messing with all this stuff  I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world really can't be designed by one person or even by a million experts. It's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands  each following their own passions  and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens. And that's the world I really want to live in. Thank you. Okay  it's great to be back at TED. Why don't I just start by firing away with the video  Woman  This is it. We're on in two minutes. Man    Okay Glass  hang out with The Flying Club. Man    Google  photos of tiger heads.  Hmm. Man    You ready  You ready   Barking  Woman    Right there. Okay  Glass  take a picture. Man    Go  Man    Holy  beep   That is awesome. Child  Whoa  Look at that snake  Woman    Okay  Glass  record a video  Man    After this bridge  first exit. Man    Okay  A    right there  Man    Google  say  delicious  in Thai. Google Glass       Man    Mmm       . Woman    Google  jellyfish.  Man     It's beautiful. Sergey Brin  Oh  sorry  I just got this message from a Nigerian prince. He needs help getting    million dollars. I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company  and it's gone pretty well. Though in all seriousness  this position that you just saw me in  looking down at my phone  that's one of the reasons behind this project  Project Glass. Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life  how you want to connect to information. Should it be by just walking around looking down  But that was the vision behind Glass  and that's why we've created this form factor. Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot  but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it. In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you're out and about looking at your phone  it's kind of  is this what you're meant to do with your body  You're standing around there and you're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass. You're just kind of moving around. So when we developed Glass  we thought really about  can we make something that frees your hands  You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there. They were all wearing Glass  and that's how we got that footage. And also you want something that frees your eyes. That's why we put the display up high  out of your line of sight  so it wouldn't be where you're looking and it wouldn't be where you're making eye contact with people. And also we wanted to free up the ears  so the sound actually goes through  conducts straight to the bones in your cranium  which is a little bit freaky at first  but you get used to it. And ironically  if you want to hear it better  you actually just cover your ear  which is kind of surprising  but that's how it works. My vision when we started Google    years ago was that eventually you wouldn't have to have a search query at all. You'd just have information come to you as you needed it. And this is now     years later  sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth. This project has lasted now  been just over two years. We've learned an amazing amount. It's been really important to make it comfortable. So our first prototypes we built were huge. It was like cell phones strapped to your head. It was very heavy  pretty uncomfortable. We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job  and then she almost ran away screaming. But we've come a long way. And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera. Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all  but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family  my kids. I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment. And lastly I've realized  in experimenting with this device  that I also kind of have a nervous tic. The cell phone is    yeah  you have to look down on it and all that  but it's also kind of a nervous habit. Like if I smoked  I'd probably just smoke instead. I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler. You know  I'd be like    But in this case  you know  I whip this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to. But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away  be it email or social posts or whatnot  even though it wasn't really    there's nothing really that important or that pressing. And with this  I know I will get certain messages if I really need them  but I don't have to be checking them all the time. Yeah  I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more  doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video. Thank you all very much. There's something that I'd like you to see. millions in China  footage of a two year old girl hit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby  footage too graphic to be shown. The entire accident is caught on camera. The driver pauses after hitting the child  his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second. Within two minutes  three people pass two year old Wang Yue by. The first walks around the badly injured toddler completely. Others look at her before moving off. Peter Singer  There were other people who walked past Wang Yue  and a second van ran over her legs before a street cleaner raised the alarm. She was rushed to hospital  but it was too late. She died. I wonder how many of you  looking at that  said to yourselves just now   I would not have done that. I would have stopped to help.  Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you. As I thought  that's most of you. And I believe you. I'm sure you're right. But before you give yourself too much credit  look at this. UNICEF reports that in        .  million children under five died from preventable  poverty related diseases. UNICEF thinks that that's good news because the figure has been steadily coming down from    million in     . That is good. But still   .  million is        children dying every day. Does it really matter that we're not walking past them in the street  Does it really matter that they're far away  I don't think it does make a morally relevant difference. The fact that they're not right in front of us  the fact  of course  that they're of a different nationality or race  none of that seems morally relevant to me. What is really important is  can we reduce that death toll  Can we save some of those        children dying every day  And the answer is  yes we can. Each of us spends money on things that we do not really need. You can think what your own habit is  whether it's a new car  a vacation or just something like buying bottled water when the water that comes out of the tap is perfectly safe to drink. You could take the money you're spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization  the Against Malaria Foundation  which would take the money you had given and use it to buy nets like this one to protect children like this one  and we know reliably that if we provide nets  they're used  and they reduce the number of children dying from malaria  just one of the many preventable diseases that are responsible for some of those        children dying every day. Fortunately  more and more people are understanding this idea  and the result is a growing movement  effective altruism. It's important because it combines both the heart and the head. The heart  of course  you felt. You felt the empathy for that child. But it's really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effective and well directed  and not only that  but also I think reason helps us to understand that other people  wherever they are  are like us  that they can suffer as we can  that parents grieve for the deaths of their children  as we do  and that just as our lives and our well being matter to us  it matters just as much to all of these people. So I think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want. It does help us to put perspective on our situation. And I think that's why many of the most significant people in effective altruism have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math. And that might seem surprising  because a lot of people think   Philosophy is remote from the real world  economics  we're told  just makes us more selfish  and we know that math is for nerds.  But in fact it does make a difference  and in fact there's one particular nerd who has been a particularly effective altruist because he got this. This is the website of the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation  and if you look at the words on the top right hand side  it says   All lives have equal value.  That's the understanding  the rational understanding of our situation in the world that has led to these people being the most effective altruists in history  Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. No one  not Andrew Carnegie  not John D. Rockefeller  has ever given as much to charity as each one of these three  and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is highly effective. According to one estimate  the Gates Foundation has already saved  .  million lives and many millions more  people  getting diseases that would have made them very sick  even if eventually they survived. Over the coming years  undoubtably the Gates Foundation is going to give a lot more  is going to save a lot more lives. Well  you might say  that's fine if you're a billionaire  you can have that kind of impact. But if I'm not  what can I do  So I'm going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe stand in the way of them giving. They worry how much of a difference they can make. But you don't have to be a billionaire. This is Toby Ord. He's a research fellow in philosophy at the University of Oxford. He became an effective altruist when he calculated that with the money that he was likely to earn throughout his career  an academic career  he could give enough to cure        people of blindness in developing countries and still have enough left for a perfectly adequate standard of living. So Toby founded an organization called Giving What We Can to spread this information  to unite people who want to share some of their income  and to ask people to pledge to give    percent of what they earn over their lifetime to fighting global poverty. Toby himself does better than that. He's pledged to live on        pounds a year    that's less than        dollars    and to give the rest to those organizations. And yes  Toby is married and he does have a mortgage. This is a couple at a later stage of life  Charlie Bresler and Diana Schott  who  when they were young  when they met  were activists against the Vietnam War  fought for social justice  and then moved into careers  as most people do  didn't really do anything very active about those values  although they didn't abandon them. And then  as they got to the age at which many people start to think of retirement  they returned to them  and they've decided to cut back on their spending  to live modestly  and to give both money and time to helping to fight global poverty. Now  mentioning time might lead you to think   Well  should I abandon my career and put all of my time into saving some of these        lives that are lost every day   One person who's thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch. He's a graduate student in philosophy  and he's set up a website called        Hours  the number of hours he estimates most people spend on their career  to advise people on how to have the best  most effective career. But you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider  if they have the right abilities and character  is to go into banking or finance. Why  Because if you earn a lot of money  you can give away a lot of money  and if you're successful in that career  you could give enough to an aid organization so that it could employ  let's say  five aid workers in developing countries  and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done. So you can quintuple the impact by leading that kind of career. Here's one young man who's taken this advice. His name is Matt Weiger. He was a student at Princeton in philosophy and math  actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis last year when he graduated. But he's gone into finance in New York. He's already earning enough so that he's giving a six figure sum to effective charities and still leaving himself with enough to live on. Matt has also helped me to set up an organization that I'm working with that has the name taken from the title of a book I wrote   The Life You Can Save   which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we're going to live an ethical life  it's not enough just to follow the thou shalt nots and not cheat  steal  maim  kill  but that if we have enough  we have to share some of that with people who have so little. And the organization draws together people of different generations  like Holly Morgan  who's an undergraduate  who's pledged to give    percent of the little amount that she has  and on the right  Ada Wan  who has worked directly for the poor  but has now gone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give. Many people will think  though  that charities aren't really all that effective. So let's talk about effectiveness. Toby Ord is very concerned about this  and he's calculated that some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others  so it's very important to find the effective ones. Take  for example  providing a guide dog for a blind person. That's a good thing to do  right  Well  right  it is a good thing to do  but you have to think what else you could do with the resources. It costs about        dollars to train a guide dog and train the recipient so that the guide dog can be an effective help to a blind person. It costs somewhere between    and    dollars to cure a blind person in a developing country if they have trachoma. So you do the sums  and you get something like that. You could provide one guide dog for one blind American  or you could cure between     and       people of blindness. I think it's clear what's the better thing to do. But if you want to look for effective charities  this is a good website to go to. GiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities  not just whether they're well run  and it's screened hundreds of charities and currently is recommending only three  of which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one. So it's very tough. If you want to look for other recommendations  thelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can both have a somewhat broader list  but you can find effective organizations  and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor. I'm pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations. That's another cause that I've been concerned about all my life  the immense amount of suffering that humans inflict on literally tens of billions of animals every year. So if you want to look for effective organizations to reduce that suffering  you can go to Effective Animal Activism. And some effective altruists think it's very important to make sure that our species survives at all. So they're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction. Here's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of recently  when an asteroid passed close to our planet. Possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of asteroids that might collide with us  but actually to deflect them. So some people think that would be a good thing to give to. There's many possibilities. My final question is  some people will think it's a burden to give. I don't really believe it is. I've enjoyed giving all of my life since I was a graduate student. It's been something fulfilling to me. Charlie Bresler said to me that he's not an altruist. He thinks that the life he's saving is his own. And Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression until she got involved with effective altruism  and now is one of the happiest people she knows. I think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what I call the Sisyphus problem. Here's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian  condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder up to the top of the hill. Just as he gets there  the effort becomes too much  the boulder escapes  rolls all the way down the hill  he has to trudge back down to push it up again  and the same thing happens again and again for all eternity. Does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle  where you work hard to get money  you spend that money on consumer goods which you hope you'll enjoy using  But then the money's gone  you have to work hard to get more  spend more  and to maintain the same level of happiness  it's kind of a hedonic treadmill. You never get off  and you never really feel satisfied. Becoming an effective altruist gives you that meaning and fulfillment. It enables you to have a solid basis for self esteem on which you can feel your life was really worth living. I'm going to conclude by telling you about an email that I received while I was writing this talk just a month or so ago. It's from a man named Chris Croy  who I'd never heard of. This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery. Why was he recovering from surgery  The email began   Last Tuesday  I anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger. That started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys.  There's about     people each year in the U.S. and more in other countries who do that. I was pleased to read it. Chris went on to say that he'd been influenced by my writings in what he did. Well  I have to admit  I'm also somewhat embarrassed by that  because I still have two kidneys. But Chris went on to say that he didn't think that what he'd done was all that amazing  because he calculated that the number of life years that he had added to people  the extension of life  was about the same that you could achieve if you gave       dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation. And that did make me feel a little bit better  because I have given more than       dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation and to various other effective charities. So if you're feeling bad because you still have two kidneys as well  there's a way for you to get off the hook. Thank you. So  when I was in art school  I developed a shake in my hand  and this was the straightest line I could draw. Now in hindsight  it was actually good for some things  like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid  but at the time this was really doomsday. This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist. The shake developed out of  really  a single minded pursuit of pointillism  just years of making tiny  tiny dots. And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles  because of the shake. So to compensate  I'd hold the pen tighter  and this progressively made the shake worse  so I'd hold the pen tighter still. And this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues  I had trouble holding anything. And after spending all my life wanting to do art  I left art school  and then I left art completely. But after a few years  I just couldn't stay away from art  and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and discovered I had permanent nerve damage. And he actually took one look at my squiggly line  and said   Well  why don't you just embrace the shake   So I did. I went home  I grabbed a pencil  and I just started letting my hand shake and shake. I was making all these scribble pictures. And even though it wasn't the kind of art that I was ultimately passionate about  it felt great. And more importantly  once I embraced the shake  I realized I could still make art. I just had to find a different approach to making the art that I wanted. Now  I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism  seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole. So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn't affect the work  like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas  or  in a  D structure consisting of two by fours  creating a  D image by burning it with a blowtorch. I discovered that  if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials  my hand really wouldn't hurt  and after having gone from a single approach to art  I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons. This was the first time I'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity. At the time  I was finishing up school  and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies. I had this horrible little set of tools  and I felt like I could do so much more with the supplies I thought an artist was supposed to have. I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors. I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair from the office that I worked at. So I got out of school  I got a job  I got a paycheck  I got myself to the art store  and I just went nuts buying supplies. And then when I got home  I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box. But I sat there for hours  and nothing came to mind. The same thing the next day  and then the next  quickly slipping into a creative slump. And I was in a dark place for a long time  unable to create. And it didn't make any sense  because I was finally able to support my art  and yet I was creatively blank. But as I searched around in the darkness  I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that I never had before. And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands. Embrace the shake. And I realized  if I ever wanted my creativity back  I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it. I wondered  could you become more creative  then  by looking for limitations  What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies  At this point  I was spending a lot of my evenings in    well  I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks   but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one  so I decided to ask for   . Surprisingly  they just handed them right over  and then with some pencils I already had  I made this project for only    cents. It really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be limited in order to become limitless. I took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas  and wondered what if  instead of painting on a canvas  I could only paint on my chest  So I painted    images  one layer at a time  one on top of another  with each picture representing an influence in my life. Or what if  instead of painting with a brush  I could only paint with karate chops   Laughter  So I'd dip my hands in paint  and I just attacked the canvas  and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks. Or  what if instead of relying on myself  I had to rely on other people to create the content for the art  So for six days  I lived in front of a webcam. I slept on the floor and I ate takeout  and I asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life changing moment. Their stories became the art as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas. Or what if instead of making art to display  I had to destroy it  This seemed like the ultimate limitation  being an artist without art. This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that I called Goodbye Art  where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation. In the beginning of Goodbye Art  I focused on forced destruction  like this image of Jimi Hendrix  made with over       matches. Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally. I looked for temporary materials  like spitting out food    sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine. The last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place. So I organized candles on a table  I lit them  and then blew them out  then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles  then assembled the videos into the larger image. So the end image was never visible as a physical whole. It was destroyed before it ever existed. In the course of this Goodbye Art series  I created    different pieces with nothing left to physically display. What I thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation  as each time I created  the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project. It did not happen overnight. There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground  or  even worse  after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing. But having committed to the process  I continued on  and something really surprising came out of this. As I destroyed each project  I was learning to let go  let go of outcomes  let go of failures  and let go of imperfections. And in return  I found a process of creating art that's perpetual and unencumbered by results. I found myself in a state of constant creation  thinking only of what's next and coming up with more ideas than ever. When I think back to my three years away from art  away from my dream  just going through the motions  instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream  I just quit  I gave up. And what if I didn't embrace the shake  Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills. It turned out to be about life  and having life skills. Because ultimately  most of what we do takes place here  inside the box  with limited resources. Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and  collectively  transform our world. Looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life. Now  when I run into a barrier or I find myself creatively stumped  I sometimes still struggle  but I continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities  like using hundreds of real  live worms to make an image  using a pushpin to tattoo a banana  or painting a picture with hamburger grease. One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate. Limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity  but perhaps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts  rethink categories and challenge accepted norms. And instead of telling each other to seize the day  maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation. Thank you. What would be a good end of life  And I'm talking about the very end. I'm talking about dying. We all think a lot about how to live well. I'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well. I'm not a geriatrician. I design reading programs for preschoolers. What I know about this topic comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two. In the last few years  I helped two friends have the end of life they wanted. Jim and Shirley Modini spent their    years of marriage living off the grid on their       acre ranch in the mountains of Sonoma County. They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge for the bears and lions and so many other things that lived there. This was their dream. I met Jim and Shirley in their   s. They were both only children who chose not to have kids. As we became friends  I became their trustee and their medical advocate  but more importantly  I became the person who managed their end of life experiences. And we learned a few things about how to have a good end. In their final years  Jim and Shirley faced cancers  fractures  infections  neurological illness. It's true. At the end  our bodily functions and independence are declining to zero. What we found is that  with a plan and the right people  quality of life can remain high. The beginning of the end is triggered by a mortality awareness event  and during this time  Jim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves to take their ranch over when they were gone. This gave them the peace of mind to move forward. It might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition. But one day  you're going to say   This thing is going to get me.  Jim and Shirley spent this time letting friends know that their end was near and that they were okay with that. Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness are different. In both cases  last days are about quiet reassurance. Jim died first. He was conscious until the very end  but on his last day he couldn't talk. Through his eyes  we knew when he needed to hear again   It is all set  Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley right here at the ranch  and ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever.  From this experience I'm going to share five practices. I've put worksheets online  so if you'd like  you can plan your own end. It starts with a plan. Most people say   I'd like to die at home.  Eighty percent of Americans die in a hospital or a nursing home. Saying we'd like to die at home is not a plan. A lot of people say   If I get like that  just shoot me.  This is not a plan either  this is illegal. A plan involves answering straightforward questions about the end you want. Where do you want to be when you're no longer independent  What do you want in terms of medical intervention  And who's going to make sure your plan is followed  You will need advocates. Having more than one increases your chance of getting the end you want. Don't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child. You want someone who has the time and proximity to do this job well  and you want someone who can work with people under the pressure of an ever changing situation. Hospital readiness is critical. You are likely to be headed to the emergency room  and you want to get this right. Prepare a one page summary of your medical history  medications and physician information. Put this in a really bright envelope with copies of your insurance cards  your power of attorney  and your do not resuscitate order. Have advocates keep a set in their car. Tape a set to your refrigerator. When you show up in the E.R. with this packet  your admission is streamlined in a material way. You're going to need caregivers. You'll need to assess your personality and financial situation to determine whether an elder care community or staying at home is your best choice. In either case  do not settle. We went through a number of not quite right caregivers before we found the perfect team led by Marsha  who won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you when you can't get out there  and Caitlin  who won't let you skip your morning exercises but knows when you need to hear that your wife is in good hands. Finally  last words. What do you want to hear at the very end  and from whom would you like to hear it  In my experience  you'll want to hear that whatever you're worried about is going to be fine. When you believe it's okay to let go  you will. So  this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial. What I've learned is if we put some time into planning our end of life  we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life. Here are Jim and Shirley just after deciding who would take care of their ranch. Here's Jim just a few weeks before he died  celebrating a birthday he didn't expect to see. And here's Shirley just a few days before she died being read an article in that day's paper about the significance of the wildlife refuge at the Modini ranch. Jim and Shirley had a good end of life  and by sharing their story with you  I hope to increase our chances of doing the same. Thank you. When we use the word  architect  or  designer   what we usually mean is a professional  someone who gets paid  and we tend to assume that it's those professionals who are going to be the ones to help us solve the really big  systemic design challenges that we face like climate change  urbanization and social inequality. That's our kind of working presumption. And I think it's wrong  actually. In       I was just about to graduate from architecture school after several years  and go out and get a job  and this happened. The economy ran out of jobs. And a couple of things struck me about this. One  don't listen to career advisers. And two  actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture  which is that  as a society  we've never needed design thinking more  and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed. It strikes me that we talk very deeply about design  but actually there's an economics behind architecture that we don't talk about  and I think we need to. And a good place to start is your own paycheck. So  as a bottom of the rung architecture graduate  I might expect to earn about        pounds. That's about                dollars. Now in terms of the whole world's population  that already puts me in the top  .   richest people  which raises the question of  who is it I'm working for  The uncomfortable fact is that actually almost everything that we call architecture today is actually the business of designing for about the richest one percent of the world's population  and it always has been. The reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when  actually  the one percent would build on behalf of the    percent  for various different reasons  whether that was through philanthropy in the   th century  communism in the early   th  the welfare state  and most recently  of course  through this inflated real estate bubble. And all of those booms  in their own various ways  have now kicked the bucket  and we're back in this situation where the smartest designers and architects in the world are only really able to work for one percent of the population. Now it's not just that that's bad for democracy  though I think it probably is  it's actually not a very clever business strategy  actually. I think the challenge facing the next generation of architects is  how are we going to turn our client from the one percent to the     percent  And I want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas for how it might be done. The first is  I think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings. Actually  a building is about the most expensive solution you can think of to almost any given problem. And fundamentally  design should be much  much more interested in solving problems and creating new conditions. So here's a story. The office was working with a school  and they had an old Victorian school building. And they said to the architects   Look  our corridors are an absolute nightmare. They're far too small. They get congested between classes. There's bullying. We can't control them. So what we want you to do is re plan our entire building  and we know it's going to cost several million pounds  but we're reconciled to the fact.  And the team thought about this  and they went away  and they said   Actually  don't do that. Instead  get rid of the school bell. And instead of having one school bell that goes off once  have several smaller school bells that go off in different places and different times  distribute the traffic through the corridors.  It solves the same problem  but instead of spending several million pounds  you spend several hundred pounds. Now  it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job  but you're not. You're actually making yourself more useful. Architects are actually really  really good at this kind of resourceful  strategic thinking. And the problem is that  like a lot of design professions  we got fixated on the idea of providing a particular kind of consumer product  and I don't think that needs to be the case anymore. The second idea worth questioning is this   th century thing that mass architecture is about big    big buildings and big finance. Actually  we've got ourselves locked into this Industrial Era mindset which says that the only people who can make cities are large organizations or corporations who build on our behalf  procuring whole neighborhoods in single  monolithic projects  and of course  form follows finance. So what you end up with are single  monolithic neighborhoods based on this kind of one size fits all model. And a lot of people can't even afford them. But what if  actually  it's possible now for cities to be made not just by the few with a lot but also by the many with a bit  And when they do  they bring with them a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live. And it raises really interesting questions about  how will we plan cities  How will finance development  How will we sell design services  What would it mean for democratic societies to offer their citizens a right to build  And in a way it should be kind of obvious  right  that in the   st century  maybe cities can be developed by citizens. And thirdly  we need to remember that  from a strictly economic point of view  design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly    mostly it's done by amateurs. And that's a good thing. Most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy in what's called the social economy or the core economy  which is people doing it for themselves. And the problem is that  up until now  it was the monetary economy which had all the infrastructure and all the tools. So the challenge we face is  how are we going to build the tools  the infrastructure and the institutions for architecture's social economy  And that began with open source software. And over the last few years  it's been moving into the physical world with open source hardware  which are freely shared blueprints that anyone can download and make for themselves. And that's where  D printing gets really  really interesting. Right  When suddenly you had a  D printer that was open source  the parts for which could be made on another  D printer. Or the same idea here  which is for a CNC machine  which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood. What these technologies are doing is radically lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill. They're challenging the idea that if you want something to be affordable it's got to be one size fits all. And they're distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities. We're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere  and increasingly that means that the design team is everyone. That really is an industrial revolution. And when we think that the major ideological conflicts that we inherited were all based around this question of who should control the means of production  and these technologies are coming back with a solution  actually  maybe no one. All of us. And we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture. So about a year and a half ago  we started working on a project called WikiHouse  and WikiHouse is an open source construction system. And the idea is to make it possible for anyone to go online  access a freely shared library of  D models which they can download and adapt in  at the moment  SketchUp  because it's free  and it's easy to use  and almost at the click of a switch they can generate a set of cutting files which allow them  in effect  to print out the parts from a house using a CNC machine and a standard sheet material like plywood. And the parts are all numbered  and basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit. And it goes together without any bolts. It uses wedge and peg connections. And even the mallets to make it can be provided on the cutting sheets as well. And a team of about two or three people  working together  can build this. They don't need any traditional construction skills. They don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that  and they can build a small house of about this size in about a day. And what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house onto which you can then apply systems like windows and cladding and insulation and services based on what's cheap and what's available. Of course  the house is never finished. We're shifting our heads here  so the house is not a finished product. With the CNC machine  you can make new parts for it over its life or even use it to make the house next door. So we can begin to see the seed of a completely open source  citizen led urban development model  potentially. And we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now  and some really interesting lessons here. One of them is that it's always incredibly sociable. People get confused between construction work and having fun. But the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane  physical details. Like  never designing a piece that can't be lifted up. Or  when you're designing a piece  make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round  or  if you do  it doesn't matter  because it's symmetrical. Probably the principal which runs deepest with us is the principal set out by Linus Torvalds  the open source pioneer  which was that idea of   Be lazy like a fox.  Don't reinvent the wheel every time. Take what already works  and adapt it for your own needs. Contrary to almost everything that you might get taught at an architecture school  copying is good. Which is appropriate  because actually  this approach is not innovative. It's actually how we built buildings for hundreds of years before the Industrial Revolution in these sorts of community barn raisings. The only difference between traditional vernacular architecture and open source architecture might be a web connection  but it's a really  really big difference. We shared the whole of WikiHouse under a Creative Commons license  and now what's just beginning to happen is that groups around the world are beginning to take it and use it and hack it and tinker with it  and it's amazing. There's a cool group over in Christchurch in New Zealand looking at post earthquake development housing  and thanks to the TED city Prize  we're working with an awesome group in one of Rio's favelas to set up a kind of community factory and micro university. These are very  very small beginnings  and actually there's more people in the last week who have got in touch and they're not even on this map. I hope next time you see it  you won't even be able to see the map. We're aware that WikiHouse is a very  very small answer  but it's a small answer to a really  really big question  which is that globally  right now  the fastest growing cities are not skyscraper cities. They're self made cities in one form or another. If we're talking about the   st century city  these are the guys who are going to be making it. You know  like it or not  welcome to the world's biggest design team. So if we're serious about problems like climate change  urbanization and health  actually  our existing development models aren't going to do it. As I think Robert Neuwirth said  there isn't a bank or a corporation or a government or an NGO who's going to be able to do it if we treat citizens only as consumers. How extraordinary would it be  though  if collectively we were to develop solutions not just to the problem of structure that we've been working on  but to infrastructure problems like solar powered air conditioning  off grid energy  off grid sanitation    low cost  open source  high performance solutions that anyone can very  very easily make  and to put them all into a commons where they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone  A kind of Wikipedia for stuff  And once something's in the commons  it will always be there. How much would that change the rules  And I think the technology's on our side. If design's great project in the   th century was the democratization of consumption    that was Henry Ford  Levittown  Coca Cola  IKEA   I think design's great project in the   st century is the democratization of production. And when it comes to architecture in cities  that really matters. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hi  everybody. Ban gap seum ni da. I'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life. I might look successful and happy being in front of you today  but I once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair. The violin  which meant everything to me  became a grave burden on me. Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me  their words sounded like meaningless noise. When I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering  I started to rediscover the true power of music. In the midst of hardship  it was the music that gave me    that restored my soul. The comfort the music gave me was just indescribable  and it was a real eye opening experience for me too  and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist. Do you feel like you are all alone  I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart  as it did for me. Thank you. Now  I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries. My audience is anyone who is here to listen  even those who are not familiar with classical music. I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center  but also hospitals  churches  prisons  and restricted facilities for leprosy patients  just to mention a few. Now  with my last piece  I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun  exciting  and that it can rock you. Let me introduce you to my brand new project   Baroque in Rock   which became a golden disc most recently. It's such an honor for me. I think  while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician  I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined. But it's now your turn. Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world. Just play your life with all you have  and share it with the world. I really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you  TEDsters. Play your life  and stay tuned. I'm almost like a crazy evangelical. I've always known that the age of design is upon us  almost like a rapture. If the day is sunny  I think   Oh  the gods have had a good design day.  Or  I go to a show and I see a beautiful piece by an artist  particularly beautiful  I say he's so good because he clearly looked to design to understand what he needed to do. So I really do believe that design is the highest form of creative expression. That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design  and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture  is still posters  is still fast cars  what you see at MoMA today. But in truth  what I really would like to explain to the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that the most interesting chairs are the ones that are actually made by a robot  like this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij  where a robot deposits a toothpaste like slur of recycled refrigerator parts  as if he were a big candy  and makes a chair out of it. Or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time and that become part of our identity. I want people to understand that design is so much more than cute chairs  that it is first and foremost everything that is around us in our life. And it's interesting how so much of what we're talking about tonight is not simply design but interaction design. And in fact  interaction design is what I've been trying to insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art for a few years  starting not very timidly but just pointedly with works  for instance  by Martin Wattenberg    the way a machine plays chess with itself  that you see here  or Lisa Strausfeld and her partners  the Sugar interface for One Laptop Per Child  Toshio Iwai's Tenori On musical instruments  and Philip Worthington's Shadow Monsters  and John Maeda's Reactive Books  and also Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's I Want You To Want Me. These were some of the first acquisitions that really introduced the idea of interaction design to the public. But more recently  I've been trying really to go even deeper into interaction design with examples that are emotionally really suggestive and that really explain interaction design at a level that is almost undeniable. The Wind Map  by Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi gas  I don't know if you've ever seen it    it's really fantastic. It looks at the territory of the United States as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds and that is really giving you a pictorial image of what's going on with the winds in the United States. But also  more recently  we started acquiring video games  and that's where all hell broke loose in a really interesting way.  Laughter  There are still people that believe that there's a high and there's a low. And that's really what I find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the anointment of video games in the MoMA collection. We've    No  first of all  New York Magazine always gets it. I love them. So we are in the right quadrant. We are in the Highbrow    that's daring  that's courageous    and Brilliant  which is great. Timidly  we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations  but it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good.  Laughter  But here comes the art critic. Oh  that was fantastic. So the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian.  Sorry  MoMA  video games are not art.  Did I ever say they were art  I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.  Exhibiting Pac Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh     They're two floors away.  Laughter     will mean game over for any real understanding of art.  I'm bringing in the end of the world. You know  We were talking about the rapture  It's coming. And Jonathan Jones is making it happen. So the same Guardian rebuts   Are video games art  the debate that shouldn't be. Last week  Guardian art critic blah blah suggested that games cannot qualify as art. But is he right  And does it matter   Thank you. Does it matter  You know  it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art  or the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to aspire to  would like to be called  artists. No. Designers aspire to be really great designers. Thank you very much. And that's more than enough. So my knight in shining armor  John Maeda  without any prompt  came out with this big declaration on why video games belong in the MoMA. And that was fantastic. And I thought that was it. But then there was another wonderfully pretentious article that came out in The New Republic  so pretentious  by Liel Leibovitz  and it said   MoMA has mistaken video games for art.  Again.  The museum is putting Pac Man alongside Picasso.  Again.  That misses the point.  Excuse me. You're missing the point. And here  look  the above question is put bluntly   Are video games art  No. Video games aren't art because they are quite thoroughly something else  code.  Oh  so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right  So it's so fantastic to see how these feathers that were ruffled  and these reactions  were so vehement. And you know what  The International Cat Video Film Festival didn't have that much of a reaction.  Laughter  I think this was truly fantastic. We were talking about dancing ponies  but I was really jealous of the Walker Arts Center for putting up this festival  because it's very  very wonderful. And there's this Flaubert quote that I love   I have always tried to live in an ivory tower  but a tide of shit is beating at its walls  threatening to undermine it.  I consider myself the tide of shit. You know  we have to go through that. Even in the     s  my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the customs officers that decided they were not art. So it's happened before  and it will happen in the future  but right now I can tell you that I am so  so proud to be able to call Pac Man part of the MoMA collection. And the same with  for instance  Tetris  original version  the Soviet one. And you know  the amount of work    yeah  Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government and that's how he developed Tetris  and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube that makes it look slightly bombed. And it's fantastic. So behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work  because we're still the Museum of Modern Art  so even when we tackle popular culture  we tackle it as a form of interaction design and as something that has to go into the collection at MoMA  therefore  has to be researched. So to get to choosing Eric Chahi's wonderful Another World  amongst others  we put together a panel of experts  and we worked on this acquisition  and it's mostly myself and Kate Carmody and Paul Galloway. We worked on it for a year and a half. So many people helped us   designers of games  you might know Jamin Warren and his collaborators at Kill Screen magazine  and you know  Kevin Slavin. You name it. We bugged everybody  because we knew that we were ignorant. We were not real gamers enough  so we had to really talk to them. And so we decided  of course  to have Sim City       not the other Sim City  that one in particular  so the criteria that we developed along the way were really strong  and were not only criteria of selection. They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation. That's what makes this acquisition more than a little game or a little joke. It's truly a way to think of how to preserve and show artifacts that will more and more become part of our lives in the future. We live today  as you know very well  not in the digital  not in the physical  but in the kind of minestrone that our mind makes of the two. And that's really where interaction lies  and that's the importance of interaction. And in order to explain interaction  we need to really bring people in and make them realize how interaction is part of their lives. So when I talk about it  I don't talk only about video games  which are in a way the purest form of interaction  unadulterated by any kind of function or finality. I also talk about the MetroCard vending machine  which I consider a masterpiece of interaction. I mean  that interface is beautiful. It looks like a burly MTA guy coming out of the tunnel. You know  with your mitt you can actually paw the MetroCard  and I talk about how bad ATM machines usually are. So I let people understand that it's up to them to know how to judge interaction so as to know when it's good or when it's bad. So when I show The Sims  I try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with The Sims  not only the fun but also the responsibility that came with the Tamagotchi. You know  video games can be truly deep even when they're completely mindless. I'm sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy. It's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can in a finite amount of time and hopefully you'll be able to make it into a planet. I've never made it into a planet  but that's it. Or  you know  Vib Ribbon was not distributed here in the United States. It was a PlayStation game  but mostly for Japan. And it was one of the first video games in which you could choose your own music. So you would put into the PlayStation  you would put your own CD  and then the game would change alongside your music. So really fantastic. Not to mention Eve Online. Eve Online is an artificial universe  if you wish  but one of the diplomats that was killed in Benghazi  not Ambassador Stevens  but one of his collaborators  was a really big shot in Eve Online  so here you have a diplomat in the real world that spends his time in Eve Online to kind of test  maybe  all of his ideas about diplomacy and about universe building  and to the point that the first announcement of the bombing was actually given on Eve Online  and after his death  several parts of the universe were named after him. And I was just recently at the Eve Online fan festival in Reykjav k that was quite amazing. I mean  we're talking about an experience that of course can seem weird to many  but that is very educational. Of course  there are games that are even more educational. Dwarf Fortress is like the holy grail of this kind of massive multiplayer online game  and in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjav k  and they were greeted by a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans. It was amazing to see. And it's a beautiful game. So you start seeing here that the aesthetics that are so important to a museum collection like MoMA's are kept alive also by the selection of these games. And you know  Valve    you know  Portal    is an example of a video game in which you have a certain type of violence which also leads me to talk about one of the biggest issues that we had to discuss when we acquired the video games  what to do with violence. Right  We had to make decisions. At MoMA  interestingly  there's a lot of violence depicted in the art part of the collection  but when I came to MoMA    years ago  and as an Italian  I said   You know what  we need a Beretta.  And I was told   No. No guns in the design collection.  And I was like   Why   Interestingly  I learned that it's considered that in design and in the design collection  what you see is what you get. So when you see a gun  it's an instrument for killing in the design collection. If it's in the art collection  it might be a critique of the killing instrument. So it's very interesting. But we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design  so maybe one day we'll be able to acquire also the guns. But here  in this particular case  we decided  you know  with Kate and Paul  that we would have no gratuitous violence. So we have Portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces. We have Street Fighter II  because martial arts are good. But we don't have GTA because  maybe it's my own reflection  I've never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps. So it was not very constructive.  Laughter  So  I'm making fun of it  but we discussed this for so many days. You have no idea. And to this day  I am ambivalent  but when you have instead games like Flow  there's no doubt. It's like  it's about serenity and it's about sublime. It's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature. Then we have a few also side scrollers    classical ones. So it's quite a hefty collection. And right now  we started with the first     but we have several that are coming up  and the reason why we haven't acquired them yet is because you don't acquire just the game. You acquire the relationship with the company. What we want  what we aspire to  is the code. It's very hard to get  of course. But that's what would enable us to preserve the video games for a really long time  and that's what museums do. They also preserve artifacts for posterity. In absence of the code  because  you know  video game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases  in absence of that  we acquire the relationship with the company. We're going to stay with them forever. They're not going to get rid of us. And one day  we'll get that code.  Laughter  But I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose for interaction design. Aesthetics are really important. And I'm showing you Core War here  which is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically of the limitations of the processor. So the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness  which is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important. And so is space  the spatial aspect of games. You know  I feel that the best video games are the ones that have really savvy architects that are behind them  and if they're not architects  bona fide trained in architecture  they have that feeling. But the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important. Time. The way we experience time in video games  as in other forms of interaction design  is really quite amazing. It can be real time or it can be the time within the game  as is in Animal Crossing  where seasons follow each other at their own pace. So time  space  aesthetics  and then  most important  behavior. The real core issue of interaction design is behavior. Designers that deal with interaction design behaviors that go to influence the rest of our lives. They're not just limited to our interaction with the screen. In this case  I'm showing you Marble Madness  which is a beautiful game in which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you  so you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape  and the sphere  the controller itself  gives you a sense of the movement. In a way  you can see how video games are the purest aspect of interaction design and are very useful to explain what interaction is. We don't want to show the video games with the paraphernalia. No arcade nostalgia. If anything  we want to show the code  and here you see Ben Fry's distellamap of Pac Man  of the Pac Man code. So the way we acquired the games is very interesting and very unorthodox. You see them here displayed alongside other examples of design  furniture and other parts  but there's no paraphernalia  no nostalagia  only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers. The controllers are  of course  part of the experience  so you cannot do away with it. But interestingly  this choice was not condemned too vehemently by gamers. I was afraid that they would kill us  and instead they understood  especially when I told them that I was trying to apply the same stratagem that Philip Johnson applied in      when he wanted to make people understand the importance of design  and he took propeller blades and pieces of machinery and in the MoMA galleries he put them on white pedestals against white walls  as if they were Brancusi sculptures. He created this strange distance  this shock  that made people realize how gorgeous formally  and also important functionally  design pieces were. I would like to do the same with video games. By getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts and everything else that we might remember from our childhood  I want people to understand that those are important forms of design. And in a way  the video games  the fonts and everything else lead us to make people understand a wider meaning for design. One of my dream acquisitions  which has been on hold for a few years but now will come back on the front burner  is a    . I would like to acquire it  but without owning it. I don't want it to be at MoMA and possessed by MoMA. I want it to keep flying. So it's an acquisition where MoMA makes an arrangement with an airline and keeps the Boeing     flying. And the same with the     sign that we acquired a few years ago. It was the first example of an acquisition of something that is in the public domain. And what I say to people  it's almost as if a butterfly were flying by and we captured the shadow on the wall  and just we're showing the shadow. So in a way  we're showing a manifestation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have. And it's too long to explain the acquisition  but if you want to go on the MoMA blog  there's a long post where I explain why it's such a great example of design. Along the way  I've had to burn a few chairs. You know  I've had to do away with a few concepts of design past. But I see that people are coming along  that the audiences  paradoxically  are much more responsive and much more understanding of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are. Design is truly everywhere  and design is as important as anything  and I'm so glad that  because of its diversity and because of its centrality to our lives  many more people are coming to it as a profession  as a passion  and as  very simply  part of their own culture. Thank you very much. I'm going to share with you a paradigm shifting perspective on the issues of gender violence    sexual assault  domestic violence  relationship abuse  sexual harassment  sexual abuse of children. That whole range of issues that I'll refer to in shorthand as  gender violence issues   they've been seen as women's issues that some good men help out with  but I have a problem with that frame and I don't accept it. I don't see these as women's issues that some good men help out with. In fact  I'm going to argue that these are men's issues  first and foremost. Now obviously  they're also women's issues  so I appreciate that  but calling gender violence a women's issue is part of the problem  for a number of reasons. The first is that it gives men an excuse not to pay attention. Right  A lot of men hear the term  women's issues  and we tend to tune it out  and we think   Hey  I'm a guy. That's for the girls   or  That's for the women.  And a lot of men literally don't get beyond the first sentence as a result. It's almost like a chip in our brain is activated  and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the term  women's issues.  This is also true  by the way  of the word  gender   because a lot of people hear the word  gender  and they think it means  women.  So they think that gender issues is synonymous with women's issues. There's some confusion about the term gender. And actually  let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy. So let's talk for a moment about race. In the U.S.  when we hear the word  race   a lot of people think that means African American  Latino  Asian American  Native American  South Asian  Pacific Islander  on and on. A lot of people  when they hear the word  sexual orientation  think it means gay  lesbian  bisexual. And a lot of people  when they hear the word  gender   think it means women. In each case  the dominant group doesn't get paid attention to. Right  As if white people don't have some sort of racial identity or belong to some racial category or construct  as if heterosexual people don't have a sexual orientation  as if men don't have a gender. This is one of the ways that dominant systems maintain and reproduce themselves  which is to say the dominant group is rarely challenged to even think about its dominance  because that's one of the key characteristics of power and privilege  the ability to go unexamined  lacking introspection  in fact being rendered invisible in large measure in the discourse about issues that are primarily about us. And this is amazing how this works in domestic and sexual violence  how men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation about a subject that is centrally about men. And I'm going to illustrate what I'm talking about by using the old tech. I'm old school on some fundamental regards. I work with    I make films    and I work with high tech  but I'm still old school as an educator  and I want to share with you this exercise that illustrates on the sentence structure level how the way that we think  literally the way that we use language  conspires to keep our attention off of men. This is about domestic violence in particular  but you can plug in other analogues. This comes from the work of the feminist linguist Julia Penelope. It starts with a very basic English sentence   John beat Mary.  That's a good English sentence. John is the subject. Beat is the verb. Mary is the object. Good sentence. Now we're going to move to the second sentence  which says the same thing in the passive voice.  Mary was beaten by John.  And now a whole lot has happened in one sentence. We've gone from  John beat Mary  to  Mary was beaten by John.  We've shifted our focus in one sentence from John to Mary  and you can see John is very close to the end of the sentence  well  close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain. The third sentence  John is dropped  and we have   Mary was beaten   and now it's all about Mary. We're not even thinking about John. It's totally focused on Mary. Over the past generation  the term we've used synonymous with  beaten  is  battered   so we have  Mary was battered.  And the final sentence in this sequence  flowing from the others  is   Mary is a battered woman.  So now Mary's very identity    Mary is a battered woman    is what was done to her by John in the first instance. But we've demonstrated that John has long ago left the conversation. Now  those of us who work in the domestic and sexual violence field know that victim blaming is pervasive in this realm  which is to say  blaming the person to whom something was done rather than the person who did it. And we say things like  why do these women go out with these men  Why are they attracted to these men  Why do they keep going back  What was she wearing at that party  What a stupid thing to do. Why was she drinking with that group of guys in that hotel room  This is victim blaming  and there are numerous reasons for it  but one of them is that our whole cognitive structure is set up to blame victims. This is all unconscious. Our whole cognitive structure is set up to ask questions about women and women's choices and what they're doing  thinking  and wearing. And I'm not going to shout down people who ask questions about women  okay  It's a legitimate thing to ask. But's let's be clear  Asking questions about Mary is not going to get us anywhere in terms of preventing violence. We have to ask a different set of questions. You can see where I'm going with this  right  The questions are not about Mary. They're about John. The questions include things like  why does John beat Mary  Why is domestic violence still a big problem in the United States and all over the world  What's going on  Why do so many men abuse  physically  emotionally  verbally  and other ways  the women and girls  and the men and boys  that they claim to love  What's going on with men  Why do so many adult men sexually abuse little girls and little boys  Why is that a common problem in our society and all over the world today  Why do we hear over and over again about new scandals erupting in major institutions like the Catholic Church or the Penn State football program or the Boy Scouts of America  on and on and on  And then local communities all over the country and all over the world  right  We hear about it all the time. The sexual abuse of children. What's going on with men  Why do so many men rape women in our society and around the world  Why do so many men rape other men  What is going on with men  And then what is the role of the various institutions in our society that are helping to produce abusive men at pandemic rates  Because this isn't about individual perpetrators. That's a naive way to understanding what is a much deeper and more systematic social problem. You know  the perpetrators aren't these monsters who crawl out of the swamp and come into town and do their nasty business and then retreat into the darkness. That's a very naive notion  right  Perpetrators are much more normal than that  and everyday than that. So the question is  what are we doing here in our society and in the world  What are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce abusive men  What's the role of religious belief systems  the sports culture  the pornography culture  the family structure  economics  and how that intersects  and race and ethnicity and how that intersects  How does all this work  And then  once we start making those kinds of connections and asking those important and big questions  then we can talk about how we can be transformative  in other words  how can we do something differently  How can we change the practices  How can we change the socialization of boys and the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes  These are the kind of questions that we need to be asking and the kind of work that we need to be doing  but if we're endlessly focused on what women are doing and thinking in relationships or elsewhere  we're not going to get to that piece. Now  I understand that a lot of women who have been trying to speaking out about these issues  today and yesterday and for years and years  often get shouted down for their efforts. They get called nasty names like  male basher  and  man hater   and the disgusting and offensive  feminazi.  Right  And you know what all this is about  It's called kill the messenger. It's because the women who are standing up and speaking out for themselves and for other women as well as for men and boys  it's a statement to them to sit down and shut up  keep the current system in place  because we don't like it when people rock the boat. We don't like it when people challenge our power. You'd better sit down and shut up  basically. And thank goodness that women haven't done that. Thank goodness that we live in a world where there's so much women's leadership that can counteract that. But one of the powerful roles that men can play in this work is that we can say some things that sometimes women can't say  or  better yet  we can be heard saying some things that women often can't be heard saying. Now  I appreciate that that's a problem. It's sexism. But it's the truth. And so one of the things that I say to men  and my colleagues and I always say this  is we need more men who have the courage and the strength to start standing up and saying some of this stuff  and standing with women and not against them and pretending that somehow this is a battle between the sexes and other kinds of nonsense. We live in the world together. And by the way  one of the things that really bothers me about some of the rhetoric against feminists and others who have built the battered women's and rape crisis movements around the world is that somehow  like I said  that they're anti male. What about all the boys who are profoundly affected in a negative way by what some adult man is doing against their mother  themselves  their sisters  What about all those boys  What about all the young men and boys who have been traumatized by adult men's violence  You know what  The same system that produces men who abuse women produces men who abuse other men. And if we want to talk about male victims  let's talk about male victims. Most male victims of violence are the victims of other men's violence. So that's something that both women and men have in common. We are both victims of men's violence. So we have it in our direct self interest  not to mention the fact that most men that I know have women and girls that we care deeply about  in our families and our friendship circles and every other way. So there's so many reasons why we need men to speak out. It seems obvious saying it out loud. Doesn't it  Now  the nature of the work that I do and my colleagues do in the sports culture and the U.S. military  in schools  we pioneered this approach called the bystander approach to gender violence prevention. And I just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach  because it's a big thematic shift  although there's lots of particulars  but the heart of it is  instead of seeing men as perpetrators and women as victims  or women as perpetrators  men as victims  or any combination in there. I'm using the gender binary. I know there's more than men and women  there's more than male and female. And there are women who are perpetrators  and of course there are men who are victims. There's a whole spectrum. But instead of seeing it in the binary fashion  we focus on all of us as what we call bystanders  and a bystander is defined as anybody who is not a perpetrator or a victim in a given situation  so in other words friends  teammates  colleagues  coworkers  family members  those of us who are not directly involved in a dyad of abuse  but we are embedded in social  family  work  school  and other peer culture relationships with people who might be in that situation. What do we do  How do we speak up  How do we challenge our friends  How do we support our friends  But how do we not remain silent in the face of abuse  Now  when it comes to men and male culture  the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are. And when I say abusive  I don't mean just men who are beating women. We're not just saying a man whose friend is abusing his girlfriend needs to stop the guy at the moment of attack. That's a naive way of creating a social change. It's along a continuum  we're trying to get men to interrupt each other. So  for example  if you're a guy and you're in a group of guys playing poker  talking  hanging out  no women present  and another guy says something sexist or degrading or harassing about women  instead of laughing along or pretending you didn't hear it  we need men to say   Hey  that's not funny. You know  that could be my sister you're talking about  and could you joke about something else  Or could you talk about something else  I don't appreciate that kind of talk.  Just like if you're a white person and another white person makes a racist comment  you'd hope  I hope  that white people would interrupt that racist enactment by a fellow white person. Just like with heterosexism  if you're a heterosexual person and you yourself don't enact harassing or abusive behaviors towards people of varying sexual orientations  if you don't say something in the face of other heterosexual people doing that  then  in a sense  isn't your silence a form of consent and complicity  Well  the bystander approach is trying to give people tools to interrupt that process and to speak up and to create a peer culture climate where the abusive behavior will be seen as unacceptable  not just because it's illegal  but because it's wrong and unacceptable in the peer culture. And if we can get to the place where men who act out in sexist ways will lose status  young men and boys who act out in sexist and harassing ways towards girls and women  as well as towards other boys and men  will lose status as a result of it  guess what  We'll see a radical diminution of the abuse. Because the typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted. He's a normal guy in every other way. Isn't he  Now  among the many great things that Martin Luther King said in his short life was   In the end  what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends.  In the end  what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends. There's been an awful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of men's violence against women and children  hasn't there  There's been an awful lot of silence. And all I'm saying is that we need to break that silence  and we need more men to do that. Now  it's easier said than done  because I'm saying it now  but I'm telling you it's not easy in male culture for guys to challenge each other  which is one of the reasons why part of the paradigm shift that has to happen is not just understanding these issues as men's issues  but they're also leadership issues for men. Because ultimately  the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues should not fall on the shoulders of little boys or teenage boys in high school or college men. It should be on adult men with power. Adult men with power are the ones we need to be holding accountable for being leaders on these issues  because when somebody speaks up in a peer culture and challenges and interrupts  he or she is being a leader  really  right  But on a big scale  we need more adult men with power to start prioritizing these issues  and we haven't seen that yet  have we  Now  I was at a dinner a number of years ago  and I work extensively with the U.S. military  all the services. And I was at this dinner and this woman said to me    I think she thought she was a little clever    she said   So how long have you been doing sensitivity training with the Marines   And I said   With all due respect  I don't do sensitivity training with the Marines. I run a leadership program in the Marine Corps.  Now  I know it's a bit pompous  my response  but it's an important distinction  because I don't believe that what we need is sensitivity training. We need leadership training  because  for example  when a professional coach or a manager of a baseball team or a football team    and I work extensively in that realm as well    makes a sexist comment  makes a homophobic statement  makes a racist comment  there will be discussions on the sports blogs and in sports talk radio. And some people will say   Well  he needs sensitivity training.  And other people will say   Well get off it. You know  that's political correctness run amok  and he made a stupid statement. Move on.  My argument is  he doesn't need sensitivity training. He needs leadership training  because he's being a bad leader  because in a society with gender diversity and sexual diversity    and racial and ethnic diversity  you make those kind of comments  you're failing at your leadership. If we can make this point that I'm making to powerful men and women in our society at all levels of institutional authority and power  it's going to change  it's going to change the paradigm of people's thinking. You know  for example  I work a lot in college and university athletics throughout North America. We know so much about how to prevent domestic and sexual violence  right  There's no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes  coaches  administrators  as part of their educational process. We know enough to know that we can easily do that. But you know what's missing  The leadership. But it's not the leadership of student athletes. It's the leadership of the athletic director  the president of the university  the people in charge who make decisions about resources and who make decisions about priorities in the institutional settings. That's a failure  in most cases  of men's leadership. Look at Penn State. Penn State is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach. You had so many situations in that realm where men in powerful positions failed to act to protect children  in this case  boys. It's unbelievable  really. But when you get into it  you realize there are pressures on men. There are constraints within peer cultures on men  which is why we need to encourage men to break through those pressures. And one of the ways to do that is to say there's an awful lot of men who care deeply about these issues. I know this. I work with men  and I've been working with tens of thousands  hundreds of thousands of men for many  many decades now. It's scary  when you think about it  how many years. But there's so many men who care deeply about these issues  but caring deeply is not enough. We need more men with the guts  with the courage  with the strength  with the moral integrity to break our complicit silence and challenge each other and stand with women and not against them. By the way  we owe it to women. There's no question about it. But we also owe it to our sons. We also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world in situations where they didn't make the choice to be a man in a culture that tells them that manhood is a certain way. They didn't make the choice. We that have a choice have an opportunity and a responsibility to them as well. I hope that  going forward  men and women  working together  can begin the change and the transformation that will happen so that future generations won't have the level of tragedy that we deal with on a daily basis. I know we can do it. We can do better. Thank you very much.  Applause  When I was a young boy  I used to gaze through the microscope of my father at the insects in amber that he kept in the house. And they were remarkably well preserved  morphologically just phenomenal. And we used to imagine that someday  they would actually come to life and they would crawl out of the resin  and  if they could  they would fly away. If you had asked me    years ago whether or not we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals  I would have told you  it's unlikely. If you had asked whether or not we would actually be able to revive an extinct species  I would have said  pipe dream. But I'm actually standing here today  amazingly  to tell you that not only is the sequencing of extinct genomes a possibility  actually a modern day reality  but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach  maybe not from the insects in amber    in fact  this mosquito was actually used for the inspiration for  Jurassic Park    but from woolly mammoths  the well preserved remains of woolly mammoths in the permafrost. Woollies are a particularly interesting  quintessential image of the Ice Age. They were large. They were hairy. They had large tusks  and we seem to have a very deep connection with them  like we do with elephants. Maybe it's because elephants share many things in common with us. They bury their dead. They educate the next of kin. They have social knits that are very close. Or maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time  because elephants  like us  share their origins in Africa some seven million years ago  and as habitats changed and environments changed  we actually  like the elephants  migrated out into Europe and Asia. So the first large mammoth that appears on the scene is meridionalis  which was standing four meters tall weighing about    tons  and was a woodland adapted species and spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia  across the Bering land bridge and into parts of North America. And then  again  as climate changed as it always does  and new habitats opened up  we had the arrival of a steppe adapted species called trogontherii in Central Asia pushing meridionalis out into Western Europe. And the open grassland savannas of North America opened up  leading to the Columbian mammoth  a large  hairless species in North America. And it was really only about         years later that we had the arrival of the woolly  the one that we all know and love so much  spreading from an East Beringian point of origin across Central Asia  again pushing the trogontherii out through Central Europe  and over hundreds of thousands of years migrating back and forth across the Bering land bridge during times of glacial peaks and coming into direct contact with the Columbian relatives living in the south  and there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years during traumatic climatic shifts. So there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions in temperature and environment  and doing very  very well. And there they survive on the mainland until about        years ago  and actually  surprisingly  on the small islands off of Siberia and Alaska until about       years ago. So Egyptians are building pyramids and woollies are still living on islands. And then they disappear. Like    percent of all the animals that have once lived  they go extinct  likely due to a warming climate and fast encroaching dense forests that are migrating north  and also  as the late  great Paul Martin once put it  probably Pleistocene overkill  so the large game hunters that took them down. Fortunately  we find millions of their remains strewn across the permafrost buried deep in Siberia and Alaska  and we can actually go up there and actually take them out. And the preservation is  again  like those insects in  amber   phenomenal. So you have teeth  bones with blood which look like blood  you have hair  and you have intact carcasses or heads which still have brains in them. So the preservation and the survival of DNA depends on many factors  and I have to admit  most of which we still don't quite understand  but depending upon when an organism dies and how quickly he's buried  the depth of that burial  the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment  will ultimately dictate how long DNA will survive over geologically meaningful time frames. And it's probably surprising to many of you sitting in this room that it's not the time that matters  it's not the length of preservation  it's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most. So if we were to go deep now within the bones and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process  the DNA which was once intact  tightly wrapped around histone proteins  is now under attack by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth for years during its lifetime. So those bacteria  along with the environmental bacteria  free water and oxygen  actually break apart the DNA into smaller and smaller and smaller DNA fragments  until all you have are fragments that range from    base pairs to  in the best case scenarios  a few hundred base pairs in length. So most fossils out there in the fossil record are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures. But a few of them actually have DNA fragments that survive for thousands  even a few millions of years in time. And using state of the art clean room technology  we've devised ways that we can actually pull these DNAs away from all the rest of the gunk in there  and it's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room that if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth and I extract its DNA that I'll get mammoth DNA  but I'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth  and  more complicated  I'll get all the DNA that survived in that environment with it  so the bacteria  the fungi  and so on and so forth. Not surprising then again that a mammoth preserved in the permafrost will have something on the order of    percent of its DNA being mammoth  whereas something like the Columbian mammoth  living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment over its laying in will only have   to    percent endogenous. But we've come up with very clever ways that we can actually discriminate  capture and discriminate  the mammoth from the non mammoth DNA  and with the advances in high throughput sequencing  we can actually pull out and bioinformatically re jig all these small mammoth fragments and place them onto a backbone of an Asian or African elephant chromosome. And so by doing that  we can actually get all the little points that discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant  and what do we know  then  about a mammoth  Well  the mammoth genome is almost at full completion  and we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth. So a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs  but an elephant and mammoth genome is about two billion base pairs larger  and most of that is composed of small  repetitive DNAs that make it very difficult to actually re jig the entire structure of the genome. So having this information allows us to answer one of the interesting relationship questions between mammoths and their living relatives  the African and the Asian elephant  all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago  but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share a most recent common ancestor with Asian elephants about six million years ago  so slightly closer to the Asian elephant. With advances in ancient DNA technology  we can actually now start to begin to sequence the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned  and I just wanted to talk about two of them  the woolly and the Columbian mammoth  both of which were living very close to each other during glacial peaks  so when the glaciers were massive in North America  the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones  and came into contact with the relatives living to the south  and there they shared refugia  and a little bit more than the refugia  it turns out. It looks like they were interbreeding. And that this is not an uncommon feature in Proboscideans  because it turns out that large savanna male elephants will outcompete the smaller forest elephants for their females. So large  hairless Columbians outcompeting the smaller male woollies. It reminds me a bit of high school  unfortunately. So this is not trivial  given the idea that we want to revive extinct species  because it turns out that an African and an Asian elephant can actually interbreed and have live young  and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo in Chester  U.K.  in     . So that means that we can actually take Asian elephant chromosomes  modify them into all those positions we've actually now been able to discriminate with the mammoth genome  we can put that into an enucleated cell  differentiate that into a stem cell  subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm  artificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg  and over a long and arduous procedure  actually bring back something that looks like this. Now  this wouldn't be an exact replica  because the short DNA fragments that I told you about will prevent us from building the exact structure  but it would make something that looked and felt very much like a woolly mammoth did. Now  when I bring up this with my friends  we often talk about  well  where would you put it  Where are you going to house a mammoth  There's no climates or habitats suitable. Well  that's not actually the case. It turns out that there are swaths of habitat in the north of Siberia and Yukon that actually could house a mammoth. Remember  this was a highly plastic animal that lived over tremendous climate variation. So this landscape would be easily able to house it  and I have to admit that there  is  a part of the child in me  the boy in me  that would love to see these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost of the north once again  but I do have to admit that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders whether or not we should. Thank you very much. Ryan Phelan  Don't go away. You've left us with a question. I'm sure everyone is asking this. When you say   Should we   it feels like you're reticent there  and yet you've given us a vision of it being so possible. What's your reticence  Hendrik Poinar  I don't think it's reticence. I think it's just that we have to think very deeply about the implications  ramifications of our actions  and so as long as we have good  deep discussion like we're having now  I think we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it. But I just want to make sure that we spend time thinking about why we're doing it first. RP  Perfect. Perfect answer. Thank you very much  Hendrik. HP  Thank you.  Applause  So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan  China in the     s. When I was in the first grade  the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes  all expenses paid. But my tiger mother said   No.  My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them. After surviving the Cultural Revolution  they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness  a safe and well paid job. It is not important if I like the job or not. But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer. That is me playing my imaginary piano. An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics  so I tried everything I could to go to opera school. I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show. But no adults liked the idea. No adults believed I was serious. Only my friends supported me  but they were kids  just as powerless as I was. So at age     I knew I was too old to be trained. My dream would never come true. I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second class happiness would be the best I could hope for. But that's so unfair. So I was determined to find another calling. Nobody around to teach me  Fine. I turned to books. I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.  Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei   I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience.  Jane Eyre   And I learned to be efficient from this book.  Cheaper by the Dozen   And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.   Complete Works of Sanmao   aka Echo Chan     Lessons From History  by Nan Huaijin  I came to the U.S. in       so which books did I read here first  Books banned in China  of course.  The Good Earth  is about Chinese peasant life. That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it. The Bible is interesting  but strange. That's a topic for a different day. But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany   You shall honor your father and mother.   Honor   I said.  That's so different  and better  than obey.  So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading. It offers many insights. For example  I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with. It had never occurred to me  China doesn't have to be at the center of the world. A map actually carries somebody's view. Comparative reading actually is nothing new. It's a standard practice in the academic world. There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature. Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic. So I thought  well  if comparative reading works for research  why not do it in daily life too  So I started reading books in pairs. So they can be about people      Benjamin Franklin  by Walter Isaacson   John Adams  by David McCullough     who are involved in the same event  or friends with shared experiences.   Personal History  by Katharine Graham   The Snowball  Warren Buffett and the Business of Life   by Alice Schroeder  I also compare the same stories in different genres     Laughter   Holy Bible  King James Version   Lamb  by Chrisopher Moore     or similar stories from different cultures  as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.  The Power of Myth  by Joseph Campbell  For example  both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations. For the Christ  the temptations are economic  political and spiritual. For the Buddha  they are all psychological  lust  fear and social duty    interesting. So if you know a foreign language  it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.   The Way of Chuang Tzu  Thomas Merton   Tao  The Watercourse Way  Alan Watts  Instead of lost in translation  I found there is much to gain. For example  it's through translation that I realized  happiness  in Chinese literally means  fast joy.  Huh   Bride  in Chinese literally means  new mother.  Uh oh. Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present. I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again. Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered. I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream. Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from  where passion comes from  where happiness comes from. Even a shattered dream can do that for you. So because of books  I'm here today  happy  living again with a purpose and a clarity  most of the time. So may books be always with you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause   Even in purely non religious terms  homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty. It is a pathetic little second rate substitute for reality    a pitiable flight from life. As such  it deserves no compassion  it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom  and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness.  That's from Time magazine in       when I was three years old. And last year  the president of the United States came out in favor of gay marriage. And my question is  how did we get from there to here  How did an illness become an identity  When I was perhaps six years old  I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother. And at the end of buying our shoes  the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home. My brother wanted a red balloon  and I wanted a pink balloon. My mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon. But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one. And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue. The fact that my favorite color now is blue  but I'm still gay    is evidence of both my mother's influence and its limits. When I was little  my mother used to say   The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world. And until you have children  you don't know what it's like.  And when I was little  I took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about parenting my brother and me. And when I was an adolescent  I thought that I'm gay  and so I probably can't have a family. And when she said it  it made me anxious. And after I came out of the closet  when she continued to say it  it made me furious. I said   I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in. And I want you to stop saying that.  About    years ago  I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine to write a piece about deaf culture. And I was rather taken aback. I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness. Those poor people  they couldn't hear. They lacked hearing  and what could we do for them  And then I went out into the deaf world. I went to deaf clubs. I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry. I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville  Tennessee where people complained about that slurry Southern signing. And as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world  I become convinced that deafness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said   We don't lack hearing  we have membership in a culture   were saying something that was viable. It wasn't my culture  and I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it  but I appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it  it felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture. It felt as valid perhaps even as American culture. Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf. And when her daughter was born  she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me. She was facing the question of what to do with this child. Should she say   You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter   Or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity  get involved in the Little People of America  become aware of what was happening for dwarfs  And I suddenly thought  most deaf children are born to hearing parents. Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them. Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence. Most gay people are born to straight parents. Those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world  and those gay people have to discover identity later on. And here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter. And I thought  there it is again  A family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary. And I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity. There are vertical identities  which are passed down generationally from parent to child. Those are things like ethnicity  frequently nationality  language  often religion. Those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children. And while some of them can be difficult  there's no attempt to cure them. You can argue that it's harder in the United States    our current presidency notwithstanding    to be a person of color. And yet  we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to African Americans and Asians come out with creamy skin and yellow hair. There are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group. And I call them horizontal identities  because the peer group is the horizontal experience. These are identities that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers. And those identities  those horizontal identities  people have almost always tried to cure. And I wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identities come to a good relationship with them. And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place. There's self acceptance  there's family acceptance  and there's social acceptance. And they don't always coincide. And a lot of the time  people who have these conditions are very angry because they feel as though their parents don't love them  when what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them. Love is something that ideally is there unconditionally throughout the relationship between a parent and a child. But acceptance is something that takes time. It always takes time. One of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown. When he was born  he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism  a very disabling condition  and his parents were told that he would never walk  he would never talk  he would have no intellectual capacity  and he would probably not even recognize them. And it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly. And his mother said she wasn't going to do it. And she took her son home. And even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages  she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism  and she got Clinton enrolled with him. And in the course of his childhood  he had    major surgical procedures. And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures  as a result of which he now can walk. And while he was there  they sent tutors around to help him with his school work. And he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do. And he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family. He was the first one in his family  in fact  to go to college  where he lived on campus and drove a specially fitted car that accommodated his unusual body. And his mother told me this story of coming home one day    and he went to college nearby    and she said   I saw that car  which you can always recognize  in the parking lot of a bar   she said.  Laughter   And I thought to myself  they're six feet tall  he's three feet tall. Two beers for them is four beers for him.  She said   I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him  but I went home  and I left him eight messages on his cell phone.  She said   And then I thought  if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies      And I said to her   What do you think you did that helped him to emerge as this charming  accomplished  wonderful person   And she said   What did I do  I loved him  that's all. Clinton just always had that light in him. And his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there.  I'm going to quote from another magazine of the '  s. This one is from         The Atlantic Monthly  voice of liberal America    written by an important bioethicist. He said   There is no reason to feel guilty about putting a Down syndrome child away  whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible  lethal sense. It is sad  yes    dreadful. But it carries no guilt. True guilt arises only from an offense against a person  and a Down's is not a person.  There's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made in the treatment of gay people. The fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day. But we forget how we used to see people who had other differences  how we used to see people who were disabled  how inhuman we held people to be. And the change that's been accomplished there  which is almost equally radical  is one that we pay not very much attention to. One of the families I interviewed  Tom and Karen Robards  were taken aback when  as young and successful New Yorkers  their first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome. They thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be  and so they decided they would build a little center    two classrooms that they started with a few other parents    to educate kids with D.S. And over the years  that center grew into something called the Cooke Center  where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught. In the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran  the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled. The experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors  those who are writers  some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood. The Robards had a lot to do with that. And I said   Do you regret it  Do you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome  Do you wish you'd never heard of it   And interestingly his father said   Well  for David  our son  I regret it  because for David  it's a difficult way to be in the world  and I'd like to give David an easier life. But I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome  it would be a catastrophic loss.  And Karen Robards said to me   I'm with Tom. For David  I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life. But speaking for myself    well  I would never have believed    years ago when he was born that I could come to such a point    speaking for myself  it's made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more purposeful in my whole life  that speaking for myself  I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world.  We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up. And yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before. Most deaf infants born in the United States now will receive Cochlear implants  which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver  and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech. A compound that has been tested in mice  BMN      is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene. Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism  and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene  grow to full size. Testing in humans is around the corner. There are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before  making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies  or to terminate them. And so we have both social progress and medical progress. And I believe in both of them. I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful  and I think the same thing about the medical progress. But I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other. And when I see the way they're intersecting in conditions like the three I've just described  I sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan. We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether. And a lot of the time the question of parenthood is  what do we validate in our children  and what do we cure in them  Jim Sinclair  a prominent autism activist  said   When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism ' what they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist and I had a different  non autistic child instead.' Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence. This is what we hear when you pray for a cure    that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces.  It's a very extreme point of view  but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated. They want to be whoever it is that they've come to be. One of the families I interviewed for this project was the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre. It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me  and once they agreed  they were so full of their story that they couldn't stop telling it. And the first weekend I spent with them    the first of many    I recorded more than    hours of conversation. And on Sunday night  we were all exhausted. We were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner. And I said   If Dylan were here now  do you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him   And his father said   I sure do. I'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing.  And Sue looked at the floor  and she thought for a minute. And then she looked back up and said   I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head.  When I had dinner with her a couple of years later    one of many dinners that we had together    she said   You know  when it first happened  I used to wish that I had never married  that I had never had children. If I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom  this child wouldn't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened. But I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much that I don't want to imagine a life without them. I recognize the pain they caused to others  for which there can be no forgiveness  but the pain they caused to me  there is   she said.  So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world if Dylan had never been born  I've decided that it would not have been better for me.  I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems  problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid  and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting. And then I thought  all of us who have children love the children we have  with their flaws. If some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children I have and give me other  better children    more polite  funnier  nicer  smarter    I would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle. And ultimately I feel that in the same way that we test flame retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove  so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting  which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think  where did you come from  It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed    there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia  there are only so many families of children who are transgender  there are only so many families of prodigies    who also face similar challenges in many ways    there are only so many families in each of those categories    but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating difference within your family is what people are addressing  then you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon. Ironically  it turns out  that it's our differences  and our negotiation of difference  that unite us. I decided to have children while I was working on this project. And many people were astonished and said   But how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong   And I said   I'm not studying everything that can go wrong. What I'm studying is how much love there can be  even when everything appears to be going wrong.  I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen  a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect. And when his ashes were interred  his mother said   I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed  once of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved.  And I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so. So my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis. I had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children. And so she and I have a daughter  and mother and daughter live in Texas. And my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time of whom I am the biological father  and our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura  the lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis. So the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states. And there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family. And there are people who think that families like mine shouldn't be allowed to exist. And I don't accept subtractive models of love  only additive ones. And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on  so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness. The day after our son was born  the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned. He wasn't extending his legs appropriately. She said that might mean that he had brain damage. In so far as he was extending them  he was doing so asymmetrically  which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action. And he had a very large head  which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus. And as she told me all of these things  I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor. And I thought  here I had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of parenting children who are disabled  and I didn't want to join their number. Because what I was encountering was an idea of illness. And like all parents since the dawn of time  I wanted to protect my child from illness. And I wanted also to protect myself from illness. And yet  I knew from the work I had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for  that those would ultimately be his identity  and if they were his identity they would become my identity  that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded. We took him to the MRI machine  we took him to the CAT scanner  we took this day old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw. We felt helpless. And at the end of five hours  they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly. And when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on  she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp. But I thought how my mother was right. I thought  the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world  and until you have children  you don't know what it feels like. I think children had ensnared me the moment I connected fatherhood with loss. But I'm not sure I would have noticed that if I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine. I'd encountered so much strange love  and I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns. And I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities. During these    years  I had witnessed and learned the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility  and I had come to see how it conquers everything else. And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools  enslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children and trying to breed identity out of misery  I realized that day that my research had built me a plank and that I was ready to join them on their ship. Thank you. How many of you have checked your email today  Come on  raise your hands. How many of you are checking it right now  And how about finances  Anybody check that today  Credit card  investment account  How about this week  Now  how about your household energy use  Anybody check that today  This week  Last week  A few energy geeks spread out across the room. It's good to see you guys. But the rest of us    this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet  and even we aren't paying attention to the energy use that's driving climate change. The woman in the photo with me is Harriet. We met her on our first family vacation. Harriet's paying attention to her energy use  and she is decidedly not an energy geek. This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention. This is coal  the most common source of electricity on the planet  and there's enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year. But unfortunately  between here and here  most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat. In fact  only    percent ends up as light. So this coal will last a little bit more than a month. If you wanted to light this bulb for a year  you'd need this much coal. The bad news here is that  for every unit of energy we use  we waste nine. That means there's good news  because for every unit of energy we save  we save the other nine. So the question is  how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we're using  and start wasting less of it  The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment that was run one hot summer     years ago  and only    miles from here  in San Marcos  California. Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood  asking people to turn off their air conditioning and turn on their fans. One quarter of the homes received a message that said  did you know you could save    dollars a month this summer  Turn off your air conditioning  turn on your fans. Another group got an environmental message. And still a third group got a message about being good citizens  preventing blackouts. Most people guessed that money saving message would work best of all. In fact  none of these messages worked. They had zero impact on energy consumption. It was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all. But there was a fourth message  and this message simply said   When surveyed     percent of your neighbors said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans. Please join them. Turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans.  And wouldn't you know it  they did. The people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing. So what does this tell us  Well  if something is inconvenient  even if we believe in it  moral suasion  financial incentives  don't do much to move us    but social pressure  that's powerful stuff. And harnessed correctly  it can be a powerful force for good. In fact  it already is. Inspired by this insight  my friend Dan Yates and I started a company called Opower. We built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy. We deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar sized homes. Just like those effective door hangers  we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors  and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save. We started with paper  we moved to a mobile application  web  and now even a controllable thermostat  and for the last five years we've been running the largest behavioral science experiment in the world. And it's working. Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than     million dollars on their energy bills  and we're just getting started. This year alone  in partnership with more than    utilities in six countries  we're going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings. Now  the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours  but for the rest of us  two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined for more than a year. Two terawatt hours  it's roughly half what the U.S. solar industry produced last year. And two terawatt hours  In terms of coal  we'd need to burn    of these wheelbarrows every minute around the clock every day for an entire year to get two terawatt hours of electricity. And we're not burning anything. We're just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior. But we're just one company  and this is just scratching the surface. Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted  and when I say wasted  I don't mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs. They may. I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms  and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home. That's    billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well being but does contribute to climate change. That's    billion    with a B    every year in the U.S. alone. That's half our coal usage right there. Now thankfully  some of the world's best material scientists are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources like these  and this is both fantastic and essential. But the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future  it isn't on this slide. It's in this room. It's you  and it's me. And we can harness this resource with no new material science simply by applying behavioral science. We can do it today  we know it works  and it will save us money right away. So what are we waiting for  Well  in most places  utility regulation hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison. Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy. They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it. But this story is much more than about household energy use. Take a look at the Prius. It's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science. The dashboard that shows drivers how much energy they're saving in real time makes former speed demons drive more like cautious grandmothers. Which brings us back to Harriet. We met her on our first family vacation. She came over to meet my young daughter  and she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name is also Harriet. She asked me what I did for a living  and I told her  I work with utilities to help people save energy. It was then that her eyes lit up. She looked at me  and she said   You're exactly the person I need to talk to. You see  two weeks ago  my husband and I got a letter in the mail from our utility. It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors.   And for the last two weeks  all we can think about  talk about  and even argue about  is what we should be doing to save energy. We did everything that letter told us to do  and still I know there must be more. Now I'm here with a genuine expert. Tell me. What should I do to save energy   There are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question. My goal is to make sure we are all asking it. Thank you. I am sorry I cannot show you my face  because if I do  the bad guys will come for me. My journey started    years ago. I was a young reporter. I had just come out of college. Then I got a scoop. The scoop was quite a very simple story. Police officers were taking bribes from hawkers who were hawking on the streets. As a young reporter  I thought that I should do it in a different way  so that it has a maximum impact  since everybody knew that it was happening  and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system. So I decided to go there and act as a seller. As part of selling  I was able to document the hard core evidence. The impact was great. It was fantastic. This was what many call immersion journalism  or undercover journalism. I am an undercover journalist. My journalism is hinged on three basic principles  naming  shaming and jailing. Journalism is about results. It's about affecting your community or your society in the most progressive way. I have worked on this for over    years  and I can tell you  the results are very good. One story that comes to mind in my undercover pieces is  Spirit Child.  It was about children who were born with deformities  and their parents felt that once they were born with those deformities  they were not good enough to live in the society  so they were given some concoction to take and as a result they died. So I built a prosthetic baby  and I went into the village  pretended as though this baby had been born with a deformity  and here was the guys who do the killing. They got themselves ready. In their bids to kill  I got the police on standby  and they came that fateful morning to come and kill the child. I recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction. They put it on fire. It was boiling hot  getting ready to give to the kids. Whilst this was going on  the police I had alerted  they were on standby  and just as the concoction was ready  and they were about to give it to the kids  I phoned the police  and fortunately they came and busted them. As I speak now  they are before the courts. Don't forget the key principles  naming  shaming and jailing. The court process is taking place  and I'm very sure at the end of the day we will find them  and we will put them where they belong too. Another key story that comes to mind  which relates to this spirit child phenomenon  is  The Spell of the Albinos.  I'm sure most of you may have heard  in Tanzania  children who are born with albinism are sometimes considered as being unfit to live in society. Their bodies are chopped up with machetes and are supposed to be used for some concoctions or some potions for people to get money    or so many  many stories people would tell about it. It was time to go undercover again. So I went undercover as a man who was interested in this particular business  of course. Again  a prosthetic arm was built. For the first time  I filmed on hidden camera the guys who do this  and they were ready to buy the arm and they were ready to use it to prepare those potions for people. I am glad today the Tanzanian government has taken action  but the key issue is that the Tanzanian government could only take action because the evidence was available. My journalism is about hard core evidence. If I say you have stolen  I show you the evidence that you have stolen. I show you how you stole it and when  or what you used what you had stolen to do. What is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society  My kind of journalism is a product of my society. I know that sometimes people have their own criticisms about undercover journalism. and put it on the table  so that we should not be afraid. He wants to bring the cocoa and send it to Cote d'Ivoire. So with my hidden intention  I kept quiet. I didn't utter a word. But my colleagues didn't know. So after collecting the money  when he left  we were waiting for him to bring the goods. Immediately after he left  I told my colleagues that since I was the leader of the group  I told my colleagues that if they come  we will arrest them. Second official  I don't even know the place called  unclear . I've never stepped there before. So I'm surprised. You see a hand counting money just in front of me. The next moment  you see the money in my hands  counting  whereas I have not come into contact with anybody. I have not done any business with anybody. Reporter  When Metro News contacted investigative reporter Anas Aremeyaw Anas for his reaction  he just smiled and gave this video extract he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen. The officer who earlier denied involvement pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled. Anas Aremeyaw Anas  This was another story on anticorruption. And here was him  denying. But you see  when you have the hard core evidence  you are able to affect society. Sometimes these are some of the headlines that come.  Music   I will curse Anas to death   Anas Lies   Alarm Blows Over Anas' News for Cash Video   Agenda Against Top CEPS Officials Exposed   Anas Operates with Invisible Powers    Gov't Wobbles Over Anas Video   Hunting the Hunter   Anas 'Bribe' Men in Court      Heads Roll Over Anas Tape   Finance Minister Backs Anas      Given Queries Over Anas' Story   GJA Stands By Anas   Prez. Mills Storms Tema Harbour Over Anas Video    Late Prof. John Evans Atta Mills  Former president of Ghana   John Evans Atta Mills  What Anas says is not something which is unknown to many of us  but please  those of you who are agents  and who are leading the customs officers into temptation  I'm telling you  Ghana is not going to say any good things to you about this. AAA  That was my president. I thought that I couldn't come here without giving you something special. I have a piece  and I'm excited that I'm sharing it for the first time with you here. I have been undercover in the prisons. I have been there for a long time. And I can tell you  what I saw is not nice. But again  I can only affect society and affect government if I bring out the hard core evidence. Many times  the prison authorities have denied ever having issues of drug abuse  issues of sodomy  so many issues they would deny that it ever happens. How can you obtain the hard core evidence  So I was in the prison.   Nsawan Prison   Now  what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies. Now  I happen to have followed one of my inmates  one of my friends  from his sick bed till death  and I can tell you it was not a nice thing at all. There were issues of bad food being served as I recall that some of the food I ate is just not good for a human being. Toilet facilities  very bad. I mean  you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend    and that's what I call proper  when four of us are on a manhole. It is something that if you narrate it to somebody  the person wouldn't believe it. The only way that you can let the person believe is when you show hard core evidence. Of course  drugs were abundant. It was easier to get cannabis  heroin and cocaine  faster even  in the prison than outside the prison. Evil in the society is an extreme disease. If you have extreme diseases  you need to get extreme remedies. My kind of journalism might not fit in other continents or other countries  but I can tell you  it works in my part of the continent of Africa  because usually  when people talk about corruption  they ask   Where is the evidence  Show me the evidence.  I say   This is the evidence.  And that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars. You see  we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions. That is why I was particularly excited when we launched our  Africa Investigates  series where we investigated a lot of African countries. As a result of the success of the  Africa Investigates  series  we are moving on to World Investigates. By the end of it  a lot more bad guys on our continent will be put behind bars. This will not stop. I'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism  because I know that when evil men destroy  good men must build and bind. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you. I have some questions for you. How did you end up in jail  This was just a few weeks ago  I believe  yeah  AAA  Sure. You know  undercover is all about setting the priorities right  so we got people to take me to court. So I went through the very legal process  because at the end of the day  the prison authorities want to check whether indeed you have been there or not  and that's how I got in there. CA  So someone sued you in court  and they took you there  and you were in remand custody for part of it  and you did that deliberately. AAA  Yes  yes. CA  Talk to me just about fear and how you manage that  because you're regularly putting your life at risk. How do you do that  AAA  You see  undercover is always a last resort. Before we go undercover  we follow the rules. And I'm only comfortable and I'm purged of fear whenever I am sure that all the steps have been taken. I don't do it alone. I have a backup team who help ensure that the safety and all the systems are put in place  but you've got to take very intelligent decisions whenever they are happening. If you don't  you will end up losing your life. So yes  when the backup systems are put in place  I'm okay  I go in. Risky  yes  but it's a hazard of a profession. I mean  everybody has their hazard. And once you say that is yours  you've got to take it  as and when it comes. CA  Well  you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work and you've taught us a story like no story I think any of us have heard before. And we're appreciative. We salute you. Thank you so much  Anas. AAA  Thank you. CA  Thank you. Stay safe.  Applause  Well  now we're going to the Bahamas to meet a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with in the wild for the last    years. Now I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains and what they might be doing with all that brainpower in the wild. And we know they use some of that brainpower for just living complicated lives  but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence  Well  we know a few things. We know that their brain to body ratio  which is a physical measure of intelligence  is second only to humans. Cognitively  they can understand artificially created languages. And they pass self awareness tests in mirrors. And in some parts of the world  they use tools  like sponges to hunt fish. But there's one big question left  do they have a language  and if so  what are they talking about  So decades ago  not years ago  I set out to find a place in the world where I could observe dolphins underwater to try to crack the code of their communication system. Now in most parts of the world  the water's pretty murky  so it's very hard to observe animals underwater  but I found a community of dolphins that live in these beautiful  clear  shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas which are just east of Florida. And they spend their daytime resting and socializing in the safety of the shallows  but at night  they go off the edge and hunt in deep water. Now  it's not a bad place to be a researcher  either. So we go out for about five months every summer in a    meter catamaran  and we live  sleep and work at sea for weeks at a time. My main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone  which is an underwater microphone  and this is so I can correlate sound and behavior. And most of our work's pretty non invasive. We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water  since we're actually observing them physically in the water. Now  Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species to work with for a couple of reasons. They're born without spots  and they get spots with age  and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases  so that's fun to track their behavior. And by about the age of     they're fully spotted black and white. Now the mother you see here is Mugsy. She's    years old in this shot  but dolphins can actually live into their early   s. And like all the dolphins in our community  we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots and nicks in her dorsal fin  and also the unique spot patterns as she matured over time. Now  young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up  and they use their teenage years to practice social skills  and at about the age of nine  the females become sexually mature  so they can get pregnant  and the males mature quite a bit later  at around    years of age. And dolphins are very promiscuous  and so we have to determine who the fathers are  so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material out of the water and extracting DNA. So what that means is  after    years  we are tracking three generations  including grandmothers and grandfathers. Now  dolphins are natural acousticians. They make sounds    times as high and hear sounds    times as high as we do. But they have other communication signals they use. They have good vision  so they use body postures to communicate. They have taste  not smell. And they have touch. And sound can actually be felt in the water  because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same. So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance. Now  we do know some things about how sounds are used with certain behaviors. Now  the signature whistle is a whistle that's specific to an individual dolphin  and it's like a name.  Dolphin whistling noises  And this is the best studied sound  because it's easy to measure  really  and you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves are reuniting  for example. Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks. This is the dolphin's sonar.  Dolphin echolocation noises  And they use these clicks to hunt and feed. But they can also tightly pack these clicks together into buzzes and use them socially. For example  males will stimulate a female during a courtship chase. You know  I've been buzzed in the water. Don't tell anyone. It's a secret. And you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that. So dolphins are also political animals  so they have to resolve conflicts. And they use these burst pulsed sounds as well as their head to head behaviors when they're fighting. And these are very unstudied sounds because they're hard to measure. Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight. So you're going to see two groups  and you're going to see the head to head posturing  some open mouths  lots of squawking. There's a bubble. And basically  one of these groups will kind of back off and everything will resolve fine  and it doesn't really escalate into violence too much. Now  in the Bahamas  we also have resident bottlenose that interact socially with the spotted dolphins. For example  they babysit each other's calves. The males have dominance displays that they use when they're chasing each other's females. And the two species actually form temporary alliances when they're chasing sharks away. And one of the mechanisms they use to communicate their coordination is synchrony. They synchronize their sounds and their body postures to look bigger and sound stronger. Now  these are bottlenose dolphins  and you'll see them starting to synchronize their behavior and their sounds. You see  they're synchronizing with their partner as well as the other dyad. I wish I was that coordinated. Now  it's important to remember that you're only hearing the human audible parts of dolphin sounds  and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds  and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds. Now  researchers have actually measured whistle complexity using information theory  and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages. But burst pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery. Now  these are three spectragrams. Two are human words  and one is a dolphin vocalizing. So just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin. Now  it turns out burst pulsed sounds actually look a bit like human phonemes. Now  one way to crack the code is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean  but it's a difficult job  and we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet. But a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology  an interface to do two way communication  and that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas and in real time. Now  scientists have used keyboard interfaces to try to bridge the gap with species including chimpanzees and dolphins. This underwater keyboard in Orlando  Florida  at the Epcot Center  was actually the most sophisticated ever two way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information. So we wanted to develop an interface like this in the Bahamas  but in a more natural setting. And one of the reasons we thought we could do this is because the dolphins were starting to show us a lot of mutual curiosity. They were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations and our postures  and they were also inviting us into dolphin games. Now  dolphins are social mammals  so they love to play  and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed  or sargassum in this case  around. And they're very adept. They like to drag it and drop it from appendage to appendage. Now in this footage  the adult is Caroh. She's    years old here  and this is her newborn  Cobalt  and he's just learning how to play this game. She's kind of teasing him and taunting him. He really wants that sargassum. Now  when dolphins solicit humans for this game  they'll often sink vertically in the water  and they'll have a little sargassum on their flipper  and they'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes on the bottom and let us go get it  and then we'll have a little seaweed keep away game. But when we don't dive down and get it  they'll bring it to the surface and they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail and drop it for us like they do their calves  and then we'll pick it up and have a game. And so we started thinking  well  wouldn't it be neat to build some technology that would allow the dolphins to request these things in real time  their favorite toys  So the original vision was to have a keyboard hanging from the boat attached to a computer  and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys on the keypad and happily exchange information and request toys from each other. But we quickly found out that dolphins simply were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard. They've got better things to do in the wild. They might do it in captivity  but in the wild    So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water  and we labeled four objects they like to play with  the scarf  rope  sargassum  and also had a bow ride  which is a fun activity for a dolphin.  Whistle  And that's the scarf whistle  which is also associated with a visual symbol. And these are artificially created whistles. They're outside the dolphin's normal repertoire  but they're easily mimicked by the dolphins. And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour  working out in the field with this keyboard using it with each other to do requests for toys while the dolphins were watching. And the dolphins could get in on the game. They could point at the visual object  or they could mimic the whistle. Now this is video of a session. The diver here has a rope toy  and I'm on the keyboard on the left  and I've just played the rope key  and that's the request for the toy from the human. So I've got the rope  I'm diving down  and I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention  because they're kind of like little kids. You have to keep their attention. I'm going to drop the rope  see if they come over. Here they come  and then they're going to pick up the rope and drag it around as a toy. Now  I'm at the keyboard on the left  and this is actually the first time that we tried this. I'm going to try to request this toy  the rope toy  from the dolphins using the rope sound. Let's see if they might actually understand what that means. That's the rope whistle. Up come the dolphins  and drop off the rope  yay. Wow. So this is only once. We don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles. Okay  so here's a second toy in the water. This is a scarf toy  and I'm trying to lead the dolphin over to the keyboard to show her the visual and the acoustic signal. Now this dolphin  we call her  the scarf thief   because over the years she's absconded with about    scarves. In fact  we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas. So I'm reaching over. She's got the scarf on her right side. And we try to not touch the animals too much  we really don't want to over habituate them. And I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard. And the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound to request the scarf. So I try to give her the scarf. Whoop. Almost lost it. But this is the moment where everything becomes possible. The dolphin's at the keyboard. You've got full attention. And this sometimes went on for hours. And I wanted to share this video with you not to show you any big breakthroughs  because they haven't happened yet  but to show you the level of intention and focus that these dolphins have  and interest in the system. And because of this  we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology. So we joined forces with Georgia Tech  with Thad Starner's wearable computing group  to build us an underwater wearable computer that we're calling CHAT.  CHAT  Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry  Now  instead of pushing a keyboard through the water  the diver's wearing the complete system  and it's acoustic only  so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad on the forearm  the sounds go out through an underwater speaker  if a dolphin mimics the whistle or a human plays the whistle  the sounds come in and are localized by two hydrophones. The computer can localize who requested the toy if there's a word match. And the real power of the system is in the real time sound recognition  so we can respond to the dolphins quickly and accurately. And we're at prototype stage  but this is how we hope it will play out. So Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle  the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water  but also as a word through bone conduction. So Diver A plays the scarf whistle or Diver B plays the sargassum whistle to request a toy from whoever has it. What we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle  and if Diver A has the sargassum  if that's the sound that was played and requested  then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin and they'll swim away happily into the sunset playing sargassum for forever. Now  how far can this kind of communication go  Well  CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins to request things from us. It's designed to really be two way. Now  will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally  We hope so and we think so. But as we decode their natural sounds  we're also planning to put those back into the computerized system. For example  right now we can put their own signature whistles in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin. Likewise  we can create our own whistles  our own whistle names  and let the dolphins request specific divers to interact with. Now it may be that all our mobile technology will actually be the same technology that helps us communicate with another species down the road. In the case of a dolphin  you know  it's a species that  well  they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways and we might not be able to admit that right now  but they live in quite a different environment  and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems. I mean  imagine what it would be like to really understand the mind of another intelligent species on the planet. Thank you. I made a film that was impossible to make  but I didn't know it was impossible  and that's how I was able to do it.  Mars et Avril  is a science fiction film. It's set in Montreal some    years in the future. No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before because it's expensive  it's set in the future  and it's got tons of visual effects  and it's shot on green screen. Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make ever since I was a kid  really  back when I was reading some comic books and dreaming about what the future might be. When American producers see my film  they think that I had a big budget to do it  like    million. But in fact I had    percent of that budget. I did  Mars et Avril  for only  .  million. So you might wonder  what's the deal here  How did I do this  Well  it's two things. First  it's time. When you don't have money  you must take time  and it took me seven years to do  Mars et Avril.  The second aspect is love. I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved. And it seems like every department had nothing  so they had to rely on our creativity and turn every problem into an opportunity. And that brings me to the point of my talk  actually  how constraints  big creative constraints  can boost creativity. But let me go back in time a bit. In my early   s  I did some graphic novels  but they weren't your usual graphic novels. They were books telling a science fiction story through images and text  and most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation  they were already involved in these books portraying characters into a sort of experimental  theatrical  simplistic way. And one of these actors is the great stage director and actor Robert Lepage. And I just love this guy. I've been in love with this guy since I was a kid. His career I admire a lot. And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project  and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of Eug ne Spaak  who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation in between time  space  love  music and women. And he was a perfect fit for the part  and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance. He was the one who believed in me and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books into a film  and to write  direct  and produce the film myself. And Robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity. Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet. I mean  his agenda is booked until       and he's really hard to get  and I wanted him to be in the movie  to reprise his role in the movie. But the thing is  had I waited for him until       my film wouldn't be a futuristic film anymore  so I just couldn't do that. Right  But that's kind of a big problem. How do you get somebody who is too busy to star in a movie  Well  I said as a joke in a production meeting    and this is a true story  by the way   I said   Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram  Because  you know  he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time  and he's an illuminated being in my mind  and he's in between reality and virtual reality  so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram.  Everybody around the table laughed  but the joke was kind of a good solution  so that's what we ended up doing. Here's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras. He was dressed in green and he was like in a green aquarium. Each camera was covering    degrees of his head  so that in post production we could use pretty much any angle we needed  and we shot only his head. Six months later there was a guy on set  a mime portraying the body  the vehicle for the head. And he was wearing a green hood so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction and replace it with Robert Lepage's head. So he became like a renaissance man  and here's what it looks like in the movie. didn't account for the technical challenges. I welded the breech  but the valve is still gaping. I tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box  but I might have hit a heartstring. It still sounds too low.  Jacques Languirand   That's normal. The instrument always ends up resembling its model.  Martin Villeneuve  Now these musical instruments that you see in this excerpt  they're my second example of how constraints can boost creativity  because I desperately needed these objects in my movie. They are objects of desire. They are imaginary musical instruments. And they carry a nice story with them. Actually  I knew what these things would look like in my mind for many  many years. But my problem was  I didn't have the money to pay for them. I couldn't afford them. So that's kind of a big problem too. How do you get something that you can't afford  And  you know  I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea. I said   What if I have somebody else pay for them   But who on Earth would be interested by seven not yet built musical instruments inspired by women's bodies  And I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal  because who better to understand the kind of crazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen  So I found my way to Guy Lalibert   Cirque du Soleil's CEO  and I presented my crazy idea to him with sketches like this and visual references  and something pretty amazing happened. Guy was interested by this idea not because I was asking for his money  but because I came to him with a good idea in which everybody was happy. It was kind of a perfect triangle in which the art buyer was happy because he got the instruments at a cheaper price  because they weren't even made. He took a leap of faith. And the artist  Dominique Engel  brilliant guy  he was happy too because he had a dream project to work on for a year. And obviously I was happy because I got the instruments in my film for free  which was kind of what I tried to do. So here they are. And my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from the green  because this is a weird color  a crazy color  and you need to replace the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later. And I had  again  pretty much  ideas in my mind as to what the world would be  but then again I turned to my childhood imagination and went to the work of Belgian comic book master Fran ois Schuiten in Belgium. And this guy is another guy I admire a lot  and I wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer. But people told me  you know  Martin  it's impossible  the guy is too busy and he will say no. Well  I said  you know what  instead of mimicking his style  I might as well call the real guy and ask him  and I sent him my books  and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium. In other words  there was space for him to dream with me. So here I was with one of my childhood heroes  drawing every single frame that's in the film to turn that into Montreal in the future. And it was an amazing collaboration to work with this great artist whom I admire. But then  you know  eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality. So  again  my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that I could think of. And there's this guy in Montreal  another Quebecois called Carlos Monzon  and he's a very good VFX artist. This guy had been lead compositor on such films as  Avatar  and  Star Trek  and  Transformers   and other unknown projects like this  and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job  and I had to convince him  and  instead of working on the next Spielberg movie  he accepted to work on mine. Why  Because I offered him a space to dream. So if you don't have money to offer to people  you must strike their imagination with something as nice as you can think of. So this is what happened on this movie  and that's how it got made  and we went to this very nice postproduction company in Montreal called Vision Globale  and they lent their    artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film. So I want to tell you that  if you have some crazy ideas in your mind  and that people tell you that it's impossible to make  well  that's an even better reason to want to do it  because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the final result  whereas if you start to deal with problems as being your allies rather than your opponents  life will start to dance with you in the most amazing way. I have experienced it. And you might end up doing some crazy projects  and who knows  you might even end up going to Mars. Thank you. The writer George Eliot cautioned us that  among all forms of mistake  prophesy is the most gratuitous. The person that we would all acknowledge as her   th century counterpart  Yogi Berra  agreed. He said   It's tough to make predictions  especially about the future.  I'm going to ignore their cautions and make one very specific forecast. In the world that we are creating very quickly  we're going to see more and more things that look like science fiction  and fewer and fewer things that look like jobs. Our cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves  which means we're going to need fewer truck drivers. We're going to hook Siri up to Watson and use that to automate a lot of the work that's currently done by customer service reps and troubleshooters and diagnosers  and we're already taking R D   painting him orange  and putting him to work carrying shelves around warehouses  which means we need a lot fewer people to be walking up and down those aisles. Now  for about     years  people have been saying exactly what I'm telling you    the age of technological unemployment is at hand   starting with the Luddites smashing looms in Britain just about two centuries ago  and they have been wrong. Our economies in the developed world have coasted along on something pretty close to full employment. Which brings up a critical question  Why is this time different  if it really is  The reason it's different is that  just in the past few years  our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never  ever had before  understanding  speaking  hearing  seeing  answering  writing  and they're still acquiring new skills. For example  mobile humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive  but the research arm of the Defense Department just launched a competition to have them do things like this  and if the track record is any guide  this competition is going to be successful. So when I look around  I think the day is not too far off at all when we're going to have androids doing a lot of the work that we are doing right now. And we're creating a world where there is going to be more and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs. It's a world that Erik Brynjolfsson and I are calling  the new machine age.  The thing to keep in mind is that this is absolutely great news. This is the best economic news on the planet these days. Not that there's a lot of competition  right  This is the best economic news we have these days for two main reasons. The first is  technological progress is what allows us to continue this amazing recent run that we're on where output goes up over time  while at the same time  prices go down  and volume and quality just continue to explode. Now  some people look at this and talk about shallow materialism  but that's absolutely the wrong way to look at it. This is abundance  which is exactly what we want our economic system to provide. The second reason that the new machine age is such great news is that  once the androids start doing jobs  we don't have to do them anymore  and we get freed up from drudgery and toil. Now  when I talk about this with my friends in Cambridge and Silicon Valley  they say   Fantastic. No more drudgery  no more toil. This gives us the chance to imagine an entirely different kind of society  a society where the creators and the discoverers and the performers and the innovators come together with their patrons and their financiers to talk about issues  entertain  enlighten  provoke each other.  It's a society really  that looks a lot like the TED Conference. And there's actually a huge amount of truth here. We are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place. In a world where it is just about as easy to generate an object as it is to print a document  we have amazing new possibilities. The people who used to be craftsmen and hobbyists are now makers  and they're responsible for massive amounts of innovation. And artists who were formerly constrained can now do things that were never  ever possible for them before. So this is a time of great flourishing  and the more I look around  the more convinced I become that this quote  from the physicist Freeman Dyson  is not hyperbole at all. This is just a plain statement of the facts. We are in the middle of an astonishing period.   Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations  of arts and of sciences.    Freeman Dyson  Which brings up another great question  What could possibly go wrong in this new machine age  Right  Great  hang up  flourish  go home. We're going to face two really thorny sets of challenges as we head deeper into the future that we're creating. The first are economic  and they're really nicely summarized in an apocryphal story about a back and forth between Henry Ford II and Walter Reuther  who was the head of the auto workers union. They were touring one of the new modern factories  and Ford playfully turns to Reuther and says   Hey Walter  how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues   And Reuther shoots back   Hey Henry  how are you going to get them to buy cars   Reuther's problem in that anecdote is that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy that's full of machines  and we see this very clearly in the statistics. If you look over the past couple decades at the returns to capital    in other words  corporate profits    we see them going up  and we see that they're now at an all time high. If we look at the returns to labor  in other words total wages paid out in the economy  we see them at an all time low and heading very quickly in the opposite direction. So this is clearly bad news for Reuther. It looks like it might be great news for Ford  but it's actually not. If you want to sell huge volumes of somewhat expensive goods to people  you really want a large  stable  prosperous middle class. We have had one of those in America for just about the entire postwar period. But the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now. We all know a lot of the statistics  but just to repeat one of them  median income in America has actually gone down over the past    years  and we're in danger of getting trapped in some vicious cycle where inequality and polarization continue to go up over time. The societal challenges that come along with that kind of inequality deserve some attention. There are a set of societal challenges that I'm actually not that worried about  and they're captured by images like this. This is not the kind of societal problem that I am concerned about. There is no shortage of dystopian visions about what happens when our machines become self aware  and they decide to rise up and coordinate attacks against us. I'm going to start worrying about those the day my computer becomes aware of my printer. So this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about. To tell you the kinds of societal challenges that are going to come up in the new machine age  I want to tell a story about two stereotypical American workers. And to make them really stereotypical  let's make them both white guys. And the first one is a college educated professional  creative type  manager  engineer  doctor  lawyer  that kind of worker. We're going to call him  Ted.  He's at the top of the American middle class. His counterpart is not college educated and works as a laborer  works as a clerk  does low level white collar or blue collar work in the economy. We're going to call that guy  Bill.  And if you go back about    years  Bill and Ted were leading remarkably similar lives. For example  in      they were both very likely to have full time jobs  working at least    hours a week. But as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented  as we started to automate the economy  and      is just about when computers started to be used by businesses  as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy  the fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot. Over this time frame  Ted has continued to hold a full time job. Bill hasn't. In many cases  Bill has left the economy entirely  and Ted very rarely has. Over time  Ted's marriage has stayed quite happy. Bill's hasn't. And Ted's kids have grown up in a two parent home  while Bill's absolutely have not over time. Other ways that Bill is dropping out of society  He's decreased his voting in presidential elections  and he's started to go to prison a lot more often. So I cannot tell a happy story about these social trends  and they don't show any signs of reversing themselves. They're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic group we look at  and they're actually getting so severe that they're in danger of overwhelming even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement. And what my friends in Silicon Valley and Cambridge are overlooking is that they're Ted. They're living these amazingly busy  productive lives  and they've got all the benefits to show from that  while Bill is leading a very different life. They're actually both proof of how right Voltaire was when he talked about the benefits of work  and the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils.   Work saves a man from three great evils  boredom  vice and need.    Voltaire  So with these challenges  what do we do about them  The economic playbook is surprisingly clear  surprisingly straightforward  in the short term especially. The robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two  so the classic Econ     playbook is going to work just fine  Encourage entrepreneurship  double down on infrastructure  and make sure we're turning out people from our educational system with the appropriate skills. But over the longer term  if we are moving into an economy that's heavy on technology and light on labor  and we are  then we have to consider some more radical interventions  for example  something like a guaranteed minimum income. Now  that's probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable  because that idea is associated with the extreme left wing and with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth. I did a little bit of research on this notion  and it might calm some folk down to know that the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income has been championed by those frothing at the mouth socialists Friedrich Hayek  Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman. And if you find yourself worried that something like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of complacent  you might be interested to know that social mobility  one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the United States  is now lower than it is in the northern European countries that have these very generous social safety nets. So the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward. The societal one is a lot more challenging. I don't know what the playbook is for getting Bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life. I do know that education is a huge part of it. I witnessed this firsthand. I was a Montessori kid for the first few years of my education  and what that education taught me is that the world is an interesting place and my job is to go explore it. The school stopped in third grade  so then I entered the public school system  and it felt like I had been sent to the Gulag. With the benefit of hindsight  I now know the job was to prepare me for life as a clerk or a laborer  but at the time it felt like the job was to kind of bore me into some submission with what was going on around me. We have to do better than this. We cannot keep turning out Bills. So we see some green shoots that things are getting better. We see technology deeply impacting education and engaging people  from our youngest learners up to our oldest ones. We see very prominent business voices telling us we need to rethink some of the things that we've been holding dear for a while. And we see very serious and sustained and data driven efforts to understand how to intervene in some of the most troubled communities that we have. So the green shoots are out there. I don't want to pretend for a minute that what we have is going to be enough. We're facing very tough challenges. To give just one example  there are about five million Americans who have been unemployed for at least six months. We're not going to fix things for them by sending them back to Montessori. And my biggest worry is that we're creating a world where we're going to have glittering technologies embedded in kind of a shabby society and supported by an economy that generates inequality instead of opportunity. But I actually don't think that's what we're going to do. I think we're going to do something a lot better for one very straightforward reason  The facts are getting out there. The realities of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known. If we wanted to accelerate that process  we could do things like have our best economists and policymakers play  Jeopardy   against Watson. We could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip. And if we do enough of these kinds of things  the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different. And then we're off to the races  because I don't believe for a second that we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges or that we have become too apathetic or hard hearted to even try. I started my talk with quotes from wordsmiths who were separated by an ocean and a century. Let me end it with words from politicians who were similarly distant. Winston Churchill came to my home of MIT in       and he said   If we are to bring the broad masses of the people in every land to the table of abundance  it can only be by the tireless improvement of all of our means of technical production.  Abraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient. He said   I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth  they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to give them the plain facts.  So the optimistic note  great point that I want to leave you with is that the plain facts of the machine age are becoming clear  and I have every confidence that we're going to use them to chart a good course into the challenging  abundant economy that we're creating. Thank you very much. So what does it mean for a machine to be athletic  We will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism and the research to achieve it with the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters  or quads  for short. Quads have been around for a long time. They're so popular these days because they're mechanically simple. By controlling the speeds of these four propellers  these machines can roll  pitch  yaw  and accelerate along their common orientation. On board are also a battery  a computer  various sensors and wireless radios. Quads are extremely agile  but this agility comes at a cost. They are inherently unstable  and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly. So  how did it just do that  Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop serve as an indoor global positioning system. It's used to locate objects in the space that have these reflective markers on them. This data is then sent to another laptop that is running estimation and control algorithms  which in turn sends commands to the quad  which is also running estimation and control algorithms. The bulk of our research is algorithms. It's the magic that brings these machines to life. So how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete  We use something broadly called model based design. We first capture the physics with a mathematical model of how the machines behave. We then use a branch of mathematics called control theory to analyze these models and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them. For example  that's how we can make the quad hover. We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations. We then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad. Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach. Suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole. With a little bit of practice  it's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this  although we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground and the use of our very versatile hands. It becomes a little bit more difficult when I only have one foot on the ground and when I don't use my hands. Notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top  which means that it can be located in the space. You can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced. How did we design the algorithms to do this  We added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad. Once we have a model of the combined quad pole system  we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it. Here  you see that it's stable  and even if I give it little nudges  it goes back    to the nice  balanced position. We can also augment the model to include where we want the quad to be in space. Using this pointer  made out of reflective markers  I can point to where I want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me. The key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms  designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory. Let's tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop  and I will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world. Notice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it. Unlike the balancing pole  I did not include the mathematical model of the glass in the system. In fact  the system doesn't even know that the glass is there. Like before  I could use the pointer to tell the quad where I want it to be in space. Okay  you should be asking yourself  why doesn't the water fall out of the glass  Two facts. The first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way. The second is that the propellers are all pointing in the same direction of the glass  pointing up. You put these two things together  the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects  which at these speeds are negligible. And that's why you don't need to model the glass. It naturally doesn't spill  no matter what the quad does. The lesson here is that some high performance tasks are easier than others  and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard. In this instance  carrying a glass of water is easy. Balancing a pole is hard. We've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured. Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage  Conventional wisdom says that you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly  because there are four degrees of freedom to control  roll  pitch  yaw and acceleration. Hexacopters and octocopters  with six and eight propellers  can provide redundancy  but quadrocopters are much more popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs  four. Or do they  If we analyze the mathematical model of this machine with only two working propellers  we discover that there's an unconventional way to fly it. We relinquish control of yaw  but roll  pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration. Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible. In this instance  this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage  just like human athletes do  instead of building machines with redundancy. We can't help but hold our breath when we watch a diver somersaulting into the water  or when a vaulter is twisting in the air  the ground fast approaching. Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry  Will the vaulter stick the landing  Suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started. This maneuver is going to happen so quickly that we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution. There simply isn't enough time. Instead  what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly  observe how it finishes the maneuver  and then use that information to modify its behavior so that the next flip is better. Similar to the diver and the vaulter  it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard. Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports. How do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort  This quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple  so not too large. The following calculations are made every    milliseconds  or    times per second. We first figure out where the ball is going. We then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from. Third  a trajectory is planned that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball. Fourth  we only execute    milliseconds' worth of that strategy. Twenty milliseconds later  the whole process is repeated until the quad strikes the ball. Machines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own  they can do it collectively. These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net. They perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me. Notice that  at full extension  these quads are vertical. In fact  when fully extended  this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels at the end of their launch. The algorithms to do this are very similar to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me. Mathematical models are used to continuously re plan a cooperative strategy    times per second. Everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities. What happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being  What I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming. It can recognize what my various body parts are doing in real time. Similar to the pointer that I used earlier  we can use this as inputs to the system. We now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures. Interaction doesn't have to be virtual. It can be physical. Take this quad  for example. It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space. If I try to move it out of the way  it fights me  and moves back to where it wants to be. We can change this behavior  however. We can use mathematical models to estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad. Once we know this force  we can also change the laws of physics  as far as the quad is concerned  of course. Here  the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid. We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine. I will use this new capability to position this camera carrying quad to the appropriate location for filming the remainder of this demonstration. So we can physically interact with these quads and we can change the laws of physics. Let's have a little bit of fun with this. For what you will see next  these quads will initially behave as if they were on Pluto. As time goes on  gravity will be increased until we're all back on planet Earth  but I assure you we won't get there. Okay  here goes. Whew  You're all thinking now  these guys are having way too much fun  and you're probably also asking yourself  why exactly are they building machine athletes  Some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom is to hone skills and develop capabilities. Others think that it has more of a social role  that it's used to bind the group. Similarly  we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits. What impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life  Like all our past creations and innovations  they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused. This is not a technical choice we are faced with  it's a social one. Let's make the right choice  the choice that brings out the best in the future of machines  just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us. Let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain. They're the current members of the Flying Machine Arena research team. Federico Augugliaro  Dario Brescianini  Markus Hehn  Sergei Lupashin  Mark Muller and Robin Ritz. Look out for them. They're destined for great things. Thank you. This will not be a speech like any one I have ever given. I will talk to you today about the failure of leadership in global politics and in our globalizing economy. And I won't provide some feel good  ready made solutions. But I will in the end urge you to rethink  actually take risks  and get involved in what I see as a global evolution of democracy. Failure of leadership. What is the failure of leadership today  And why is our democracy not working  Well  I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken you out of the process. So let me  from my personal experiences  give you an insight  so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going down a blind alley. Let's start from the beginning. Let's start from democracy. Well  if you go back to the Ancient Greeks  it was a revelation  a discovery  that we had the potential  together  to be masters of our own fate  to be able to examine  to learn  to imagine  and then to design a better life. And democracy was the political innovation which protected this freedom  because we were liberated from fear so that our minds in fact  whether they be despots or dogmas  could be the protagonists. Democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power  whether it was of tyrants or of high priests  their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth. Well  I first began to understand this when I was    years old. I used to  to try to avoid homework  sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly. You see  then Greece was under control of a very powerful establishment which was strangling the country  and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine Greece  to imagine a Greece where freedom reigned and where  maybe  the people  the citizens  could actually rule their own country. I used to join him in many of the campaigns  and you can see me here next to him. I'm the younger one there  to the side. You may not recognize me because I used to part my hair differently there. So in       elections were coming  things were going well in the campaign  the house was electric. We really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in Greece. Then one night  military trucks drive up to our house. Soldiers storm the door. They find me up on the top terrace. A sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun  puts it to my head  and says   Tell me where your father is or I will kill you.  My father  hiding nearby  reveals himself  and was summarily taken to prison. Well  we survived  but democracy did not. Seven brutal years of dictatorship which we spent in exile. Now  today  our democracies are again facing a moment of truth. Let me tell you a story. Sunday evening  Brussels  April     . I'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union. I had just been elected prime minister  but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth that our deficit was not   percent  as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections by the previous government  but actually   .  percent. But the deficit was only the symptom of much deeper problems that Greece was facing  and I had been elected on a mandate  a mission  actually  to tackle these problems  whether it was lack of transparency and accountability in governance  or whether it was a clientelistic state offering favors to the powerful    tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system  politics and media captured by special interests. But despite our electoral mandate  the markets mistrusted us. Our borrowing costs were skyrocketing  and we were facing possible default. So I went to Brussels on a mission to make the case for a united European response  one that would calm the markets and give us the time to make the necessary reforms. But time we didn't get. Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels. Negotiations are difficult  the tensions are high  progress is slow  and then     minutes to    a prime minister shouts out   We have to finish in    minutes.  I said   Why  These are important decisions. Let's deliberate a little bit longer.  Another prime minister comes in and says   No  we have to have an agreement now  because in    minutes  the markets are opening up in Japan  and there will be havoc in the global economy.  We quickly came to a decision in those    minutes. This time it was not the military  but the markets  that put a gun to our collective heads. What followed were the most difficult decisions in my life  painful to me  painful to my countrymen  imposing cuts  austerity  often on those not to blame for the crisis. With these sacrifices  Greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided a collapse. Greece  yes  triggered the Euro crisis  and some people blame me for pulling the trigger. But I think today that most would agree that Greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone  vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system  vulnerabilities of our democracies. Our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail  or  more accurately  too big to control. Our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws  evade taxes  evade environmental or labor standards. Our democracies are undermined by the growing inequality and the growing concentration of power and wealth  lobbies  corruption  the speed of the markets or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster  have constrained our democracies  and they have constrained our capacity to imagine and actually use the potential  your potential  in finding solutions. Greece  you see  was only a preview of what is in store for us all. I  overly optimistically  had hoped that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece  for Europe  for the world  to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions. Instead  I had a very humbling experience. In Brussels  when we tried desperately again and again to find common solutions  I realized that not one  not one of us  had ever dealt with a similar crisis. But worse  we were trapped by our collective ignorance. We were led by our fears. And our fears led to a blind faith in the orthodoxy of austerity. Instead of reaching out to the common or the collective wisdom in our societies  investing in it to find more creative solutions  we reverted to political posturing. And then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis  and of course that made it very easy to look for a whipping boy for our collective European failure  and of course that was Greece. Those profligate  idle  ouzo swilling  Zorba dancing Greeks  they are the problem. Punish them  Well  a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself. But let me warn you  this is not just about Greece. This could be the pattern that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex  cross border problems  whether it's climate change  whether it's migration  whether it's the financial system. That is  abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential  falling victims to our fears  our stereotypes  our dogmas  taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around our citizens. And doing so will only test the faith of our citizens  of our peoples  even more in the democratic process. It's no wonder that many political leaders  and I don't exclude myself  have lost the trust of our people. When riot police have to protect parliaments  a scene which is increasingly common around the world  then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies. That's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people own and decide on the terms of the rescue package. My European counterparts  some of them  at least  said   You can't do this. There will be havoc in the markets again.  I said   We need to  before we restore confidence in the markets  we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people.  Since leaving office  I have had time to reflect. We have weathered the storm  in Greece and in Europe  but we remain challenged. If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential  well then    percent youth unemployment in Greece  and in other countries  certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion. So far  we've thrown economics at the problem  actually mostly austerity  and certainly we could have designed alternatives  a different strategy  a green stimulus for green jobs  or mutualized debt  Eurobonds which would support countries in need from market pressures  these would have been much more viable alternatives. Yet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one of democracy. So let's try something else. Let's see how we can bring people back to the process. Let's throw democracy at the problem. Again  the Ancient Greeks  with all their shortcomings  believed in the wisdom of the crowd at their best moments. In people we trust. Democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating  debating  taking on public responsibilities for public affairs. Average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to decide on critical matters of the day. Science  theater  research  philosophy  games of the mind and the body  they were daily exercises. Actually they were an education for participation  for the potential  for growing the potential of our citizens. And those who shunned politics  well  they were idiots. You see  in Ancient Greece  in ancient Athens  that term originated there.  Idiot  comes from the root  idio   oneself. A person who is self centered  secluded  excluded  someone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs. And participation took place in the agora  the agora having two meanings  both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation. You see  markets and politics then were one  unified  accessible  transparent  because they gave power to the people. They serve the demos  democracy. Above government  above markets was the direct rule of the people. Today we have globalized the markets but we have not globalized our democratic institutions. So our politicians are limited to local politics  while our citizens  even though they see a great potential  are prey to forces beyond their control. So how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora  How do we democratize globalization  And I'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the United Nations or the G  . I'm talking about  how do we secure the space  the demos  the platform of values  so that we can tap into all of your potential  Well  this is exactly where I think Europe fits in. Europe  despite its recent failures  is the world's most successful cross border peace experiment. So let's see if it can't be an experiment in global democracy  a new kind of democracy. Let's see if we can't design a European agora  not simply for products and services  but for our citizens  where they can work together  deliberate  learn from each other  exchange between art and cultures  where they can come up with creative solutions. Let's imagine that European citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a European president  or citizen juries chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues  a European wide referendum where our citizens  as the lawmakers  vote on future treaties. And here's an idea  Why not have the first truly European citizens by giving our immigrants  not Greek or German or Swedish citizenship  but a European citizenship  And make sure we actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in Europe. Where our common identity is democracy  where our education is through participation  and where participation builds trust and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia. Europe of and by the people  a Europe  an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders. Now  some might accuse me of being naive  putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people. Well  after decades in politics  I am also a pragmatist. Believe me  I have been  I am  part of today's political system  and I know things must change. We must revive politics as the power to imagine  reimagine  and redesign for a better world. But I also know that this disruptive force of change won't be driven by the politics of today. The revival of democratic politics will come from you  and I mean all of you. Everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas  whether it's here in this room or just outside this room or online or locally  where everybody lives  everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality  everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy  dogma rather than critical thinking  technocracy rather than democracy  everyone who stands up to the unchecked power  whether it's authoritarian leaders  plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens  or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few. It is in their interest that all of us are idiots. Let's not be. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  You seem to describe a political leadership that is kind of unprepared and a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets  and that scene in Brussels that you describe  to me  as a citizen  is terrifying. Help us understand how you felt after the decision. It was not a good decision  clearly  but how do you feel after that  not as the prime minister  but as George  George Papandreou  Well  obviously there were constraints which didn't allow me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted  and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem. And that hurt. That hurt because that  first of all  hurt the younger generation  and not only  many of them are demonstrating outside  but I think this is one of our problems. When we face these crises  we have kept the potential  the huge potential of our society out of this process  and we are closing in on ourselves in politics  and I think we need to change that  to really find new participatory ways using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology  the minds that we have  and I think we can find solutions which are much better  but we have to be open. BG  You seem to suggest that the way forward is more Europe  and that is not to be an easy discourse right now in most European countries. It's rather the other way    more closed borders and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out of some of the different parts of the European construction. How do you reconcile that  GP  Well  I think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game. And the fundamental idea of Europe is that we can cooperate beyond borders  go beyond our conflicts and work together. And the paradox is that  because we have this blame game  we have less the potential to convince our citizens that we should work together  while now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together. Now  more Europe for me is not simply giving more power to Brussels. It is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe  that is  really making Europe a project of the people. So that  I think  would be a way to answer some of the fears that we have in our society. BG  George  thank you for coming to TED. GP  Thank you very much.BG  Thank you. Applause  I write fiction sci fi thrillers  so if I say  killer robots   you'd probably think something like this. But I'm actually not here to talk about fiction. I'm here to talk about very real killer robots  autonomous combat drones. Now  I'm not referring to Predator and Reaper drones  which have a human making targeting decisions. I'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons that make lethal decisions about human beings all on their own. There's actually a technical term for this  lethal autonomy. Now  lethally autonomous killer robots would take many forms    flying  driving  or just lying in wait. And actually  they're very quickly becoming a reality. These are two automatic sniper stations currently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea. Both of these machines are capable of automatically identifying a human target and firing on it  the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer. Now  in both cases  there's still a human in the loop to make that lethal firing decision  but it's not a technological requirement. It's a choice. And it's that choice that I want to focus on  because as we migrate lethal decision making from humans to software  we risk not only taking the humanity out of war  but also changing our social landscape entirely  far from the battlefield. That's because the way humans resolve conflict shapes our social landscape. And this has always been the case  throughout history. For example  these were state of the art weapons systems in      A.D. Now they were both very expensive to build and maintain  but with these you could dominate the populace  and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that. Power was focused at the very top. And what changed  Technological innovation. Gunpowder  cannon. And pretty soon  armor and castles were obsolete  and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield versus how many people you brought to the battlefield. And as armies grew in size  the nation state arose as a political and logistical requirement of defense. And as leaders had to rely on more of their populace  they began to share power. Representative government began to form. So again  the tools we use to resolve conflict shape our social landscape. Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool  except that  by requiring very few people to go to war  they risk re centralizing power into very few hands  possibly reversing a five century trend toward democracy. Now  I think  knowing this  we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions  to do what humans do best  which is adapt. But time is a factor. Seventy nations are developing remotely piloted combat drones of their own  and as you'll see  remotely piloted combat drones are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons. That's because once you've deployed remotely piloted drones  there are three powerful factors pushing decision making away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself. The first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce. For example  in       the U.S. drone fleet produced a grand total of    hours of video surveillance for analysis. By       this had gone up to         hours  outstripping human ability to review it all  but even that number is about to go up drastically. The Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programs will put up to    independently operated camera eyes on each drone platform  and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it. And that means visual intelligence software will need to scan it for items of interest. And that means very soon drones will tell humans what to look at  not the other way around. But there's a second powerful incentive pushing decision making away from humans and onto machines  and that's electromagnetic jamming  severing the connection between the drone and its operator. Now we saw an example of this in      when an American RQ     Sentinel drone got a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack  but any remotely piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack  and that means drones will have to shoulder more decision making. They'll know their mission objective  and they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance. They'll ignore external radio signals and send very few of their own. Which brings us to  really  the third and most powerful incentive pushing decision making away from humans and onto weapons  plausible deniability. Now we live in a global economy. High tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents. Cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs to parts unknown  and in that environment  it is very likely that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories  proliferate in the gray market. And in that situation  sifting through the wreckage of a suicide drone attack  it will be very difficult to say who sent that weapon. This raises the very real possibility of anonymous war. This could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head  make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower against an attacker  and that could shift the balance in the   st century away from defense and toward offense. It could make military action a viable option not just for small nations  but criminal organizations  private enterprise  even powerful individuals. It could create a landscape of rival warlords undermining rule of law and civil society. Now if responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones of representative government  autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both. Now you might be thinking that citizens of high tech nations would have the advantage in any robotic war  that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable  particularly against developing nations. But I think the truth is the exact opposite. I think citizens of high tech societies are more vulnerable to robotic weapons  and the reason can be summed up in one word  data. Data powers high tech societies. Cell phone geolocation  telecom metadata  social media  email  text  financial transaction data  transportation data  it's a wealth of real time data on the movements and social interactions of people. In short  we are more visible to machines than any people in history  and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons. What you're looking at here is a link analysis map of a social group. Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals. And these types of maps can be automatically generated based on the data trail modern people leave behind. Now it's typically used to market goods and services to targeted demographics  but it's a dual use technology  because targeting is used in another context. Notice that certain individuals are highlighted. These are the hubs of social networks. These are organizers  opinion makers  leaders  and these people also can be automatically identified from their communication patterns. Now  if you're a marketer  you might then target them with product samples  try to spread your brand through their social group. But if you're a repressive government searching for political enemies  you might instead remove them  eliminate them  disrupt their social group  and those who remain behind lose social cohesion and organization. Now in a world of cheap  proliferating robotic weapons  borders would offer very little protection to critics of distant governments or trans national criminal organizations. Popular movements agitating for change could be detected early and their leaders eliminated before their ideas achieve critical mass. And ideas achieving critical mass is what political activism in popular government is all about. Anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests. And this would put a chill on free speech and popular political action  the very heart of democracy. And this is why we need an international treaty on robotic weapons  and in particular a global ban on the development and deployment of killer robots. Now we already have international treaties on nuclear and biological weapons  and  while imperfect  these have largely worked. But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous  because they will almost certainly be used  and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions. Now in November      the U.S. Department of Defense issued a directive requiring a human being be present in all lethal decisions. This temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military  but that directive needs to be made permanent. And it could set the stage for global action. Because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons. And we need it now  before there's a devastating attack or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world to rush to adopt these weapons before thinking through the consequences. Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power in too few hands  and they would imperil democracy itself. Now  don't get me wrong  I think there are tons of great uses for unarmed civilian drones  environmental monitoring  search and rescue  logistics. If we have an international treaty on robotic weapons  how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones and vehicles while still protecting ourselves against illegal robotic weapons  I think the secret will be transparency. No robot should have an expectation of privacy in a public place. Each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed I.D. burned in at the factory that can be used to track its movement through public spaces. We have license plates on cars  tail numbers on aircraft. This is no different. And every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them  both right now and historically. And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones  and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down  they should notify humans to their presence. And in certain very high security areas  perhaps civic drones would snare them and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility. But notice  this is more an immune system than a weapons system. It would allow us to avail ourselves of the use of autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our open  civil society. We must ban the deployment and development of killer robots. Let's not succumb to the temptation to automate war. Autocratic governments and criminal organizations undoubtedly will  but let's not join them. Autonomous robotic weapons would concentrate too much power in too few unseen hands  and that would be corrosive to representative government. Let's make sure  for democracies at least  killer robots remain fiction. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone. You know that all over the world  people fight for their freedom  fight for their rights. Some battle oppressive governments. Others battle oppressive societies. Which battle do you think is harder  Allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes. Let me take you back two years ago in my life. It was the bedtime of my son  Aboody. He was five at the time. After finishing his bedtime rituals  he looked at me and he asked a question   Mommy  are we bad people   I was shocked.  Why do you say such things  Aboody   Earlier that day  I noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school. He wouldn't tell me what happened.  But now  he was ready to tell.  Two boys hit me today in school. They told me  'We saw your mom on Facebook. You and your mom should be put in jail.'  I've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything. I've been always a proud woman of my achievements. But those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth  when it all came together. You see  I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars. Just for giving me his car keys  my own brother was detained twice  and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist  leave the country with his wife and two year old son. My father had to sit in a Friday sermon listening to the imam condemning women drivers and calling them prostitutes amongst tons of worshippers  some of them our friends and family of my own father. I was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings  in the streets and in schools. It all hit me. It came into focus that those kids did not mean to be rude to my son. They were just influenced by the adults around them. And it wasn't about me  and it wasn't a punishment for taking the wheel and driving a few miles. It was a punishment for daring to challenge the society's rules. But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine. Allow me to give you a briefing about my story. It was May        and I was complaining to a work colleague about the harassments I had to face trying to find a ride back home  although I have a car and an international driver's license. As long as I've known  women in Saudi Arabia have been always complaining about the ban  but it's been    years since anyone tried to do anything about it  a whole generation ago. He broke the good bad news in my face.  But there is no law banning you from driving.  I looked it up  and he was right. There wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia. It was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women. That realization ignited the idea of June     where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive. It was a few weeks later  we started receiving all these  Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive.  A courageous woman  her name is Najla Hariri  she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah  she drove a car and she announced but she didn't record a video. We needed proof. So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube. And to my surprise  it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day. What happened next  of course  I started receiving threats to be killed  raped  just to stop this campaign. The Saudi authorities remained very quiet. That really creeped us out. I was in the campaign with other Saudi women and even men activists. We wanted to know how the authorities would respond on the actual day  June     when women go out and drive. So this time I asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car. It went fast. We were arrested  signed a pledge not to drive again  released. Arrested again  he was sent to detention for one day  and I was sent to jail. I wasn't sure why I was sent there  because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation. But what I was sure of was my innocence. I didn't break a law  and I kept my abaya   it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house   and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off  but I was so sure of my innocence  I kept saying   No  I'm leaving today.  Outside the jail  the whole country went into a frenzy  some attacking me badly  and others supportive and even collecting signatures in a petition to be sent to the king to release me. I was released after nine days. June    comes. The streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars  but some hundred brave Saudi women broke the ban and drove that day. None were arrested. We broke the taboo. So I think by now  everyone knows that we can't drive  or women are not allowed to drive  in Saudi Arabia  but maybe few know why. Allow me to help you answer this question. There was this official study that was presented to the Shura Council    it's the consultative council appointed by the king in Saudi Arabia   and it was done by a local professor  a university professor. He claims it's done based on a UNESCO study. And the study states  the percentage of rape  adultery  illegitimate children  even drug abuse  prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don't drive. I know  I was like this  I was shocked. I was like   We are the last country in the world where women don't drive.  So if you look at the map of the world  that only leaves two countries  Saudi Arabia  and the other society is the rest of the world. We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study  and it made headlines around the world.  BBC News  'End of virginity' if women drive  Saudi cleric warns  And only then we realized it's so empowering to mock your oppressor. It strips it away of its strongest weapon  fear. This system is based on ultra conservative traditions and customs that deal with women as if they are inferior and they need a guardian to protect them  so they need to take permission from this guardian  whether verbal or written  all their lives. We are minors until the day we die. And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law  or the religious laws. What's worst  when they become codified as laws in the system  and when women themselves believe in their inferiority  and they even fight those who try to question these rules. So for me  it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face. It was about living two totally different perceptions of my personality  of my person    the villain back in my home country  and the hero outside. Just to tell you  two stories happened in the last two years. One of them is when I was in jail. I'm pretty sure when I was in jail  everyone saw titles in the international media something like this during these nine days I was in jail. But in my home country  it was a totally different picture. It was more like this   Manal al Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order and inciting women to drive.  I know.  Manal al Sharif withdraws from the campaign.  Ah  it's okay. This is my favorite.  Manal al Sharif breaks down and confesses  'Foreign forces incited me.'  And it goes on  even trial and flogging me in public. So it's a totally different picture. I was asked last year to give a speech at the Oslo Freedom Forum. I was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me  and they looked at me as an inspiration. At the same time  I flew back to my home country  they hated that speech so much. The way they called it  a betrayal to the Saudi country and the Saudi people  and they even started a hashtag called  OsloTraitor on Twitter. Some        tweets were written in that hashtag  while the opposite hashtag   OsloHero  there was like a handful of tweets written. They even started a poll. More than        voters answered this poll  whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech. Ninety percent said yes  she's a traitor. So it's these two totally different perceptions of my personality. For me  I'm a proud Saudi woman  and I do love my country  and because I love my country  I'm doing this. Because I believe a society will not be free if the women of that society are not free. Thank you. Thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you. Thank you. But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you. I learned to be always there. The first thing  I got out of jail  of course after I took a shower  I went online  I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page  and I've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me. I would listen to what they say  and I would never defend myself with words only. I would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign  I filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate of traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license. There are a lot of people also    very big support  like those       people who signed the petition to release me. We sent a petition to the Shura Council in favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women  and there were  like        citizens who believed in that and they signed that petition. There were people like that  I just showed some examples  who are amazing  who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia  and trying  and they are also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views. Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women's rights. The Shura Council that's appointed by the king  by royal decree of King Abdullah  last year there were    women assigned to that Council  like    percent.    percent of the Council.  Applause  The same time  finally  that Council  after rejecting our petition four times for women driving  they finally accepted it last February. After being sent to jail or sentenced lashing  or sent to a trial  the spokesperson of the traffic police said  we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers. The Grand Mufti  who is the head of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia  he said  it's not recommended for women to drive. It used to be haram  forbidden  by the previous Grand Mufti. So for me  it's not about only these small steps. It's about women themselves. A friend once asked me  she said   So when do you think this women driving will happen   I told her   Only if women stop asking 'When ' and take action to make it now.  So it's not only about the system  it's also about us women to drive our own life  I'd say. So I have no clue  really  how I became an activist. And I don't know how I became one now. But all I know  and all I'm sure of  in the future when someone asks me my story  I will say   I'm proud to be amongst those women who lifted the ban  fought the ban  and celebrated everyone's freedom.  So the question I started my talk with  who do you think is more difficult to face  oppressive governments or oppressive societies  I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech. Thank you  everyone. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Once upon a time we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity. This was called the Great Moderation  the misguided belief by most economists  policymakers and central banks that we have transformed into a new world of never ending growth and prosperity. This was seen by robust and steady GDP growth  by low and controlled inflation  by low unemployment  and controlled and low financial volatility. But the Great Recession in      and       the great crash  broke this illusion. A few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector cascaded into five trillion dollars of losses in world GDP and almost     trillion losses in the global stock market. So the understanding of this Great Recession was that this was completely surprising  this came out of the blue  this was like the wrath of the gods. There was no responsibility. So  as a reflection of this  we started the Financial Crisis Observatory. We had the goal to diagnose in real time financial bubbles and identify in advance their critical time. What is the underpinning  scientifically  of this financial observatory  We developed a theory called  dragon kings.  Dragon kings represent extreme events which are of a class of their own. They are special. They are outliers. They are generated by specific mechanisms that may make them predictable  perhaps controllable. Consider the financial price time series  a given stock  your perfect stock  or a global index. You have these up and downs. A very good measure of the risk of this financial market is the peaks to valleys that represent a worst case scenario when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom. You can look at the statistics  the frequency of the occurrence of peak to valleys of different sizes  which is represented in this graph. Now  interestingly     percent of the peak to valleys of different amplitudes can be represented by a universal power law represented by this red line here. More interestingly  there are outliers  there are exceptions which are above this red line  occur     times more frequently  at least  than the extrapolation would predict them to occur based on the calibration of the    percent remaining peak to valleys. They are due to trenchant dependancies such that a loss is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss. These kinds of dependencies are largely missed by standard risk management tools  which ignore them and see lizards when they should see dragon kings. The root mechanism of a dragon king is a slow maturation towards instability  which is the bubble  and the climax of the bubble is often the crash. This is similar to the slow heating of water in this test tube reaching the boiling point  where the instability of the water occurs and you have the phase transition to vapor. And this process  which is absolutely non linear    cannot be predicted by standard techniques    is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior which is fundamentally endogenous. So the cause of the crash  the cause of the crisis has to be found in an inner instability of the system  and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur. Now  some of you may have come to the mind that is this not related to the black swan concept you have heard about frequently  Remember  black swan is this rare bird that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief that all swans should be white  so it has captured the idea of unpredictability  unknowability  that the extreme events are fundamentally unknowable. Nothing can be further from the dragon king concept I propose  which is exactly the opposite  that most extreme events are actually knowable and predictable. So we can be empowered and take responsibility and make predictions about them. So let's have my dragon king burn this black swan concept. There are many early warning signals that are predicted by this theory. Let me just focus on one of them  the super exponential growth with positive feedback. What does it mean  Imagine you have an investment that returns the first year five percent  the second year    percent  the third year    percent  the next year    percent. Is that not marvelous  This is a super exponential growth. A standard exponential growth corresponds to a constant growth rate  let's say  of    percent The point is that  many times during bubbles  there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times  such that previous growths enhance  push forward  increase the next growth through this kind of super exponential growth  which is very trenchant  not sustainable. And the key idea is that the mathematical solution of this class of models exhibit finite time singularities  which means that there is a critical time where the system will break  will change regime. It may be a crash. It may be just a plateau  something else. And the key idea is that the critical time  the information about the critical time is contained in the early development of this super exponential growth. We have applied this theory early on  that was our first success  to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements on the iron rocket. Using acoustic emission  you know  this little noise that you hear a structure emit  sing to you when they are stressed  and reveal the damage going on  there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback  the more damage gives the more damage  so you can actually predict  within  of course  a probability band  when the rupture will occur. So this is now so successful that it is used in the initial phase of  unclear  the flight. Perhaps more surprisingly  the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine  parturition  the act of giving birth  epileptic seizures. From seven months of pregnancy  a mother starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus that are the sign of these maturations toward the instability  giving birth to the baby  the dragon king. So if you measure the precursor signal  you can actually identify pre  and post maturity problems in advance. Epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size  and when the brain goes to a super critical state  you have dragon kings which have a degree of predictability and this can help the patient to deal with this illness. We have applied this theory to many systems  landslides  glacier collapse  even to the dynamics of prediction of success  blockbusters  YouTube videos  movies  and so on. But perhaps the most important application is for finance  and this theory illuminates  I believe  the deep reason for the financial crisis that we have gone through. This is rooted in    years of history of bubbles  starting in       with the global bubble crashing in       followed by many other bubbles. The biggest one was the  new economy  Internet bubble in       crashing in       the real estate bubbles in many countries  financial derivative bubbles everywhere  stock market bubbles also everywhere  commodity and all bubbles  debt and credit bubbles    bubbles  bubbles  bubbles. We had a global bubble. This is a measure of global overvaluation of all markets  expressing what I call an illusion of a perpetual money machine that suddenly broke in     . The problem is that we see the same process  in particular through quantitative easing  of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays to tackle the crisis since      in the U.S.  in Europe  in Japan. This has very important implications to understand the failure of quantitative easing as well as austerity measures as long as we don't attack the core  the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking. Now  these are big claims. Why would you believe me  Well  perhaps because  in the last    years we have come out of our ivory tower  and started to publish ex ante    and I stress the term ex ante  it means  in advance    before the crash confirmed the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses. These are a few of the major bubbles that we have lived through in recent history. Again  many interesting stories for each of them. Let me tell you just one or two stories that deal with massive bubbles. We all know the Chinese miracle. This is the expression of the stock market of a massive bubble  a factor of three      percent in just a few years. In September       I was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund management conference  and I showed to the conference a prediction that by the end of       this bubble would change regime. There might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable. Now  how do you believe the very smart  very motivated  very informed macro hedge fund managers reacted to this prediction  You know  they had made billions just surfing this bubble until now. They told me   Didier  yeah  the market might be overvalued  but you forget something. There is the Beijing Olympic Games coming in August       and it's very clear that the Chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also avoid any wave and control the stock market.  Three weeks after my presentation  the markets lost    percent and went through a phase of volatility  upheaval  and a total market loss of    percent until the end of the year. So how can we be so collectively wrong by misreading or ignoring the science of the fact that when an instability has developed  and the system is ripe  any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control  The Chinese market collapsed  but it rebounded. In       we also identified that this new bubble  a smaller one  was unsustainable  so we published again a prediction  in advance  stating that by August       the market will correct  will not continue on this track. Our critics  reading the prediction  said   No  it's not possible. The Chinese government is there. They have learned their lesson. They will control. They want to benefit from the growth.  Perhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously. So the crisis did occur. The market corrected. The same critics then said   Ah  yes  but you published your prediction. You influenced the market. It was not a prediction.  Maybe I am very powerful then. Now  this is interesting. It shows that it's essentially impossible until now to develop a science of economics because we are sentient beings who anticipate and there is a problem of self fulfilling prophesies. So we invented a new way of doing science. We created the Financial Bubble Experiment. The idea is the following. We monitor the markets. We identify excesses  bubbles. We do our work. We write a report in which we put our prediction of the critical time. We don't release the report. It's kept secret. But with modern encrypting techniques  we have a hash  we publish a public key  and six months later  we release the report  and there is authentication. And all this is done on an international archive so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes. Let me tease you with a very recent analysis.   th of May        just two weeks ago  we identified that the U.S. stock market was on an unsustainable path and we released this on our website on the   st of May that there will be a change of regime. The next day  the market started to change regime  course. This is not a crash. This is just the third or fourth act of a massive bubble in the making. Scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet  we see the same thing. Wherever we look  it's observable  in the biosphere  in the atmosphere  in the ocean  showing these super exponential trajectories characterizing an unsustainable path and announcing a phase transition. This diagram on the right shows a very beautiful compilation of studies suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear    possibility for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades. So there are bubbles everywhere. From one side  this is exciting for me  as a professor who chases bubbles and slays dragons  as the media has sometimes called me. But can we really slay the dragons  Very recently  with collaborators  we studied a dynamical system where you see the dragon king as these big loops and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times that removed  when control is on  these dragons.  Gouverner  c'est pr voir.  Governing is the art of planning and predicting. But is it not the case that this is probably one of the biggest gaps of mankind  which has the responsibility to steer our societies and our planet toward sustainability in the face of growing challenges and crises  But the dragon king theory gives hope. We learn that most systems have pockets of predictability. It is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises so that we can be prepared  we can take measures  we can take responsibility  and so that never again will extremes and crises like the Great Recession or the European crisis take us by surprise. Thank you. Living in Africa is to be on the edge  metaphorically  and quite literally when you think about connectivity before     . Though many human intellectual and technological leaps had happened in Europe and the rest of the world  but Africa was sort of cut off. And that changed  first with ships when we had the Renaissance  the Scientific Revolution and also the Industrial Revolution. And now we've got the digital revolution. These revolutions have not been evenly distributed across continents and nations. Never have been. Now  this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables that connect Africa to the rest of the world. What I find amazing is that Africa is transcending its geography problem. Africa is connecting to the rest of the world and within itself. The connectivity situation has improved greatly  but some barriers remain. It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be. In       one of the problems that we faced was lack of information flow. There was a media blackout in       when there was post election violence in Kenya. It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time. So we came together and we created software called Ushahidi. And Ushahidi means  testimony  or  witness  in Swahili. I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators. This is David and Erik. I call them brothers from another mother. Clearly I have a German mother somewhere. And we worked together first with building and growing Ushahidi. And the idea of the software was to gather information from SMS  email and web  and put a map so that you could see what was happening where  and you could visualize that data. And after that initial prototype  we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did. All the while  we also wanted to give back to the local tech community that helped us grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days. And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi  an actual physical space where we could collaborate  and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya. We did that with the support of different organizations like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network. And we were able to grow this software footprint  and a few years later it became very useful software  and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti where citizens could indicate where they are and what their needs were  and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis and the tsunami in Japan. Now  this year the Internet turns     and Ushahidi turned five. Ushahidi is not only the software that we made. It is the team  and it's also the community that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee. We did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world. There are crisis maps  election maps  corruption maps  and even environmental monitoring crowd maps. We are humbled that this has roots in Kenya and that it has some use to people around the world trying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with. There is more that we're doing to explore this idea of collective intelligence  that I  as a citizen  if I share the information with whatever device that I have  could inform you about what is going on  and that if you do the same  we can have a bigger picture of what's going on. I moved back to Kenya in     . Erik moved in     . Very different reality. I used to live in Chicago where there was abundant Internet access. I had never had to deal with a blackout. And in Kenya  it's a very different reality  and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress and the digital revolution is the electricity problem. The day to day frustrations of dealing with this can be  let's just say very annoying. Blackouts are not fun. Imagine sitting down to start working  and all of a sudden the power goes out  your Internet connection goes down with it  so you have to figure out  okay  now  where's the modem  how do I switch back  And then  guess what  You have to deal with it again. Now  this is the reality of Kenya  where we live now  and other parts of Africa. The other problem that we're facing is that communication costs are also still a challenge. It costs me five Kenyan shillings  or .   USD to call the U.S.  Canada or China. Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda  Ghana  Nigeria  Thirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost to connect within Africa. And also  when traveling within Africa  you've got different settings for different mobile providers. This is the reality that we deal with. So we've got a joke in Ushahidi where we say   If it works in Africa  it'll work anywhere.   Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.  What if we could overcome the problem of unreliable Internet and electricity and reduce the cost of connection  Could we leverage the cloud  We've built a crowd map  we've built Ushahidi. Could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country  So we looked at the modem  an important part of the infrastructure of the Internet  and asked ourselves why the modems that we are using right now are built for a different context  where you've got ubiquitous internet  you've got ubiquitous electricity  yet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury. We wanted to redesign the modem for the developing world  for our context  and for our reality. What if we could have connectivity with less friction  This is the BRCK. It acts as a backup to the Internet so that  when the power goes out  it fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network. Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive. It's actually everywhere. Most towns at least have a  G connection. So why don't we leverage that  And that's why we built this. The other reason that we built this is when electricity goes down  this has eight hours of battery left  so you can continue working  you can continue being productive  and let's just say you are less stressed. And for rural areas  it can be the primary means of connection. The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play when we wondered how can we use the cloud to be more intelligent so that you can analyze the different networks  and whenever you switch on the backup  you pick on the fastest network  so we'll have multi SIM capability so that you can put multiple SIMs  and if one network is faster  that's the one you hop on  and if the up time on that is not very good  then you hop onto the next one. The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere. With load balancing  this can be possible. The other interesting thing for us    we like sensors    is this idea that you could have an on ramp for the Internet of things. Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this. It's built in a modular way so that you can also attach a satellite module so that you could have Internet connectivity even in very remote areas. Out of adversity can come innovation  and how can we help the ambitious coders and makers in Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure  And for us  we begin with solving the problem in our own backyard in Kenya. It is not without challenge. Our team has basically been mules carrying components from the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations with customs border agents.  What are you carrying   And the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects. So we put it on Kickstarter  and I'm happy to say that  through the support of many people  not only here but online  the BRCK has been Kickstarted  and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins. I will close by saying that  if we solve this for the local market  it could be impactful not only for the coders in Nairobi but also for small business owners who need reliable connectivity  and it can reduce the cost of connecting  and hopefully collaboration within African countries. The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy are connectivity and entrepreneurship. The BRCK is our part to keep Africans connected  and to help them drive the global digital revolution. Thank you. I was born and raised in North Korea. Although my family constantly struggled against poverty  I was always loved and cared for first  because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family. But then the great famine began in     . I was four years old. My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at   in the morning and come back after midnight. I would wander the streets searching for food  and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother's back eating chips  and wanting to steal them from him. Hunger is humiliation. Hunger is hopelessness. For a hungry child  politics and freedom are not even thought of. On my ninth birthday  my parents couldn't give me any food to eat. But even as a child  I could feel the heaviness in their hearts. Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time  and in       when I was    years old  my father became one of them. I saw my father wither away and die. In the same year  my mother disappeared one day  and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money  but that she would return with money and food soon. Since we had never been separated  and I thought we would be together forever  I didn't even give her a hug when she left. It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. But again  I didn't know it was going to be a long goodbye. I have not seen my mom or my sister since then. Suddenly  I became an orphan and homeless. My daily life became very hard  but very simple. My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash. But that is no way to survive. I started to realize  begging would not be the solution. So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets. Sometimes  I found small jobs in exchange for food. Once  I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine     meters underground without any protection for up to    hours a day. I was not uncommon. Many other orphans survived this way  or worse. When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains  I hoped that  the next morning  my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food. That hope kept me alive. I don't mean big  grand hope. I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread  even though it usually didn't. But if I didn't believe it  I wouldn't even try  and then I would die. Hope kept me alive. Every day  I told myself  no matter how hard things got  still I must live. After three years of waiting for my sister's return  I decided to go to China to look for her myself. I realized I couldn't survive much longer this way. I knew the journey would be risky  but I would be risking my life either way. I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea  or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China. I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen. North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission. Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans  where they face severe punishment. I decided to cross during the day  first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark  second because I knew I was already taking a risk  and since not many people tried to cross during the day  I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone. I made it to China on February         . I was    years old. I thought things in China would be easier  since there was more food. I thought more people would help me. But it was harder than living in North Korea  because I was not free. I was always worried about being caught and sent back. By a miracle  some months later  I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans  and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years. Later that year  an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee. I went to America without knowing a word of English  yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school. Even in North Korea  I was an F student. And I barely finished elementary school. And I remember I fought in school more than once a day. Textbooks and the library were not my playground. My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying  but it didn't work. At one point  my father gave up on me. He said   You're not my son anymore.  I was only    or     but it hurt me deeply. But nevertheless  my level of motivation still didn't change before he died. So in America  it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school. I didn't even go to middle school. I decided to go  just because they told me to  without trying much. But one day  I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner. And during dinner  I wanted to have one more wing  but I realized there were not enough for everyone  so I decided against it. When I looked down at my plate  I saw the last chicken wing  that my foster father had given me his. I was so happy. I looked at him sitting next to me. He just looked back at me very warmly  but said no words. Suddenly I remembered my biological father. My foster father's small act of love reminded me of my father  who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry  even if he was starving. I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America  yet my father died of starvation. My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him  and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him. And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice. I took school seriously  and for the first time ever in my life  I received an academic award for excellence  and made dean's list from the first semester in high school. That chicken wing changed my life. Hope is personal. Hope is something that no one can give to you. You have to choose to believe in hope. You have to make it yourself. In North Korea  I made it myself. Hope brought me to America. But in America  I didn't know what to do  because I had this overwhelming freedom. My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction  and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America. I did not come here by myself. I had hope  but hope by itself is not enough. Many people helped me along the way to get here. North Koreans are fighting hard to survive. They have to force themselves to survive  have hope to survive  but they cannot make it without help. This is my message to you. Have hope for yourself  but also help each other. Life can be hard for everyone  wherever you live. My foster father didn't intend to change my life. In the same way  you may also change someone's life with even the smallest act of love. A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger  and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive. But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph's life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive. Thank you. Adrian Hong  Joseph  thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us. I know you haven't seen your sister for  you said  it was almost exactly a decade  and in the off chance that she may be able to see this  we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message. Joseph Kim  In Korean  AH  You can do English  then Korean as well. JK  Okay  I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don't think I can make it without tearing up. Nuna  it has been already    years that I haven t seen you. I just wanted to say that I miss you  and I love you  and please come back to me and stay alive. And I    oh  gosh. I still haven't given up my hope to see you. I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you  and I promise I will not cry again. Yes  I'm just looking forward to seeing you  and if you can't find me  I will also look for you  and I hope to see you one day. And can I also make a small message to my mom  AH  Sure  please. JK  I haven't spent much time with you  but I know that you still love me  and you probably still pray for me and think about me. I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world. Thank you. The idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal. I don't think anyone in this room would disagree. What worries me is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars    use the words    ... it all just sounds so  so simple.  Now  I've got no bucket of money today and I've got no policy to release  and I certainly haven't got a guitar. I'll leave that to others. But I do have an idea  and that idea is called Housing for Health. Housing for Health works with poor people. It works in the places where they live  and the work is done to improve their health. Over the last    years  this tough  grinding  dirty work has been done by literally thousands of people around Australia and  more recently  overseas  and their work has proven that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments. It can improve health and it can play a part in reducing  if not eliminating  poverty. I'm going to start where the story began          in Central Australia. A man called Yami Lester  an Aboriginal man  was running a health service. Eighty percent of what walked in the door  in terms of illness  was infectious disease    third world  developing world infectious disease  caused by a poor living environment. Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs. He got a medical doctor. He got an environmental health guy. And he hand selected a team of local Aboriginal people to work on this project. Yami told us at that first meeting   There's no money      always a good start      ... no money  you have six months  and I want you to start on a project     which  in his language  he called  Uwankara Palyanku Kanyintjaku   which  translated  is  a plan to stop people getting sick     a profound brief. That was our task. First step  the medical doctor went away for about six months. And he worked on what were to become these nine health goals    what were we aiming at  After six months of work  he came to my office and presented me with those nine words on a piece of paper.  The   Healthy Living Practices  Washing  clothes  wastewater  nutrition  crowding  animals  dust  temperature  injury  I was very unimpressed. Big ideas need big words  and preferably a lot of them. This didn't fit the bill. What I didn't see and what you can't see was that he'd assembled thousands of pages of local  national and international health research that filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets. The pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason. The Aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people were most commonly illiterate  so the story had to be told in pictures of what these goals were. We worked with the community  not telling them what was going to happen in a language they didn't understand. So we had the goals and each one of these goals    and I won't go through them all    puts at the center the person and their health issue  and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their health good. And the highest priority  you see on the screen  is washing people once a day  particularly children. And I hope most of you are thinking   What  That sounds simple.  Now  I'm going to ask you all a very personal question. This morning before you came  who could have had a wash using a shower  I'm not going to ask if you had a shower  because I'm too polite. That's it. All right  I think it's fair to say most people here could have had a shower this morning. I'm going to ask you to do some more work. I want you all to select one of the houses of the    houses you see on the screen. I want you to select one of them and note the position of that house and keep that in your head. Have you all got a house  I'm going to ask you to live there for a few months  so make sure you've got it right. It's in the northwest of Western Australia  very pleasant place. OK. Let's see if your shower in that house is working. I hear some  Aw   and I hear some  Ah   If you get a green tick  your shower's working. You and your kids are fine. If you get a red cross  well  I've looked carefully around the room and it's not going to make much difference to this crew. Why  Because you're all too old. I know that's going to come as a shock to some of you  but you are. And before you get offended and leave  I've got to say that being too old  in this case  means that pretty much everyone in the room  I think  is over five years of age. We're really concerned with kids naught to five. And why  Washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs  the common infectious diseases of the eyes  the ears  the chest and the skin that  if they occur in the first five years of life  permanently damage those organs. They leave a lifelong remnant. That means that by the age of five  you can't see as well for the rest of your life. You can't hear as well for the rest of your life. You can't breathe as well. You've lost a third of your lung capacity by the age of five. And even skin infection  which we originally thought wasn't that big a problem  mild skin infections naught to five give you a greatly increased chance of renal failure  needing dialysis at age   . This is a big deal  so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids. Those ticks and crosses represent the       houses we've looked at nationally around Australia  the same proportion. What you see on the screen       percent of those not so famous houses lived in by        indigenous people       percent had a working shower. Ten percent of those same       houses had safe electrical systems. And    percent of those houses had a working toilet. These are by a simple  standard test. In the case of the shower  does it have hot and cold water  two taps that work  a shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body  and a drain that takes the water away  Not well designed  not beautiful  not elegant    just that they function. And the same tests for the electrical system and the toilets. Housing for Health projects aren't about measuring failure    they're actually about improving houses. We start on day one of every project. We've learned    we don't make promises  we don't do reports. We arrive in the morning with tools  tons of equipment  trades  and we train up a local team on the first day to start work. By the evening of the first day  a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning. That work continues for six to    months  until all the houses are improved and we've spent our budget of       dollars total per house. That's our average budget. At the end of six months to a year  we test every house again. It's very easy to spend money. It's very difficult to improve the function of all those parts of the house. And for a whole house  the nine healthy living practices  we test  check and fix     items in every house. And these are the results we can get with our       dollars. We can get showers up to    percent working  we can get electrical systems up to    percent working and we can get    percent of toilets working in those       houses. Thank you. The teams do a great job  and that's their work. I think there's an obvious question that I hope you're thinking about. Why do we have to do this work  Why are the houses in such poor condition  Seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance    the sort of things that happen in all our houses. Things wear out  should have been done by state government or local government  simply not done  the house doesn't work. Twenty one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction    literally things that are built upside down and back to front. They don't work  we have to fix them. And if you've lived in Australia in the last    years  the final cause    you will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses. It's one of the almost rock solid pieces of evidence which I've never seen evidence for  that's always reeled out as  That's the problem with indigenous housing.  Well  nine percent of what we spend is damage  misuse or abuse of any sort. We argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem. And we'll go a lot further than that  the people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution. Seventy five percent of our national team in Australia    over    at the minute    are actually local  indigenous people from the communities we work in. They do all aspects of the work. In       for example  there were      all over Australia  and the Torres Strait Islands  all states  working to improve the houses where they and their families live  and that's an important thing. Our work's always had a focus on health. That's the key. The developing world bug  trachoma  causes blindness. It's a developing world illness  and yet  the picture you see behind is in an Aboriginal community in the late     s  where    percent of school aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes  doing damage. OK  what do we do  Well  first thing we do  we get showers working. Why  Because that flushes the bug out. We put washing facilities in the school as well  so kids can wash their faces many times during the day. We wash the bug out. Second  the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye and lets the bug in quick. So what do we do  We call up the doctor of dust  and there is such a person. He was loaned to us by a mining company. He controls dust on mining company sites. And he came out and  within a day  it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground  the wind driven dust    so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids. So we used dirt to stop dust. We did it. He provided us dust monitors. We tested and we reduced the dust. Then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally. So how do we do that  Well  we call up the doctor of flies    and  yes  there is a doctor of flies. As our Aboriginal mate said   You white fellows ought to get out more.  And the doctor of flies very quickly determined that there was one fly that carried the bug. He could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide. They could trap the flies  send them to him in Perth. When the bug was in the gut  he'd send back by return post some dung beetles. The dung beetles ate the camel dung  the flies died through lack of food  and trachoma dropped. And over the year  trachoma dropped radically in this place  and stayed low. We changed the environment  not just treated the eyes. And finally  you get a good eye. All these small health gains and small pieces of the puzzle make a big difference. The New South Wales Department of Health  that radical organization  did an independent trial over three years to look at    years of the work we've been doing in these sorts of projects in New South Wales. And they found a    percent reduction in hospital admissions for the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment    a    percent reduction. Just to show that the principles we've used in Australia can be used in other places  I'm just going to go to one other place  and that's Nepal. And what a beautiful place to go. We were asked by a small village of     people to go in and make toilets where none existed. Health was poor. We went in with no grand plan  no grand promises of a great program  just the offer to build two toilets for two families. It was during the design of the first toilet that I went for lunch  invited by the family into their main room of the house. It was choking with smoke. People were cooking on their only fuel source  green timber. The smoke coming off that timber is choking  and in an enclosed house  you simply can't breathe. Later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through respiratory failure. So all of a sudden  we had two problems. We were there originally to look at toilets and get human waste off the ground  that's fine. But all of a sudden now there was a second problem  How do we actually get the smoke down  So two problems  and design should be about more than one thing. Solution  Take human waste  take animal waste  put it into a chamber  out of that  extract biogas  methane gas. The gas gives three to four hours cooking a day    clean  smokeless and free for the family. I put it to you  is this eliminating poverty  And the answer from the Nepali team who's working at the minute would say  don't be ridiculous    we have three million more toilets to build before we can even make a stab at that claim. And I don't pretend anything else. But as we all sit here today  there are now over     toilets built in this village and a couple nearby. Well over       people use those toilets. Yami Lama  he's a young boy. He's got significantly less gut infection because he's now got toilets  and there isn't human waste on the ground. Kanji Maya  she's a mother  and a proud one. She's probably right now cooking lunch for her family on biogas  smokeless fuel. Her lungs have got better  and they'll get better as time increases  because she's not cooking in the same smoke. Surya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber when it's shed the gas  he puts it on his crops. He's trebled his crop income  more food for the family and more money for the family. And finally Bishnu  the leader of the team  has now understood that not only have we built toilets  we've also built a team  and that team is now working in two villages where they're training up the next two villages to keep the work expanding. And that  to me  is the key. People are not the problem. We've never found that. The problem  poor living environment  poor housing and the bugs that do people harm. None of those are limited by geography  by skin color or by religion. None of them. The common link between all the work we've had to do is one thing  and that's poverty. Nelson Mandela said  in the mid     s  not too far from here  he said that like slavery and apartheid   Poverty is not natural. It is man made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.  I want to end by saying it's been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings doing    I think    extraordinary work  that have actually improved health  and  maybe only in a small way  reduced poverty. Thank you very much for your time. Everything is interconnected. As a Shinnecock Indian  I was raised to know this. We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York. When I was a little girl  my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day. There were no clouds in the sky. And after a while I began to perspire. And he pointed up to the sky  and he said   Look  do you see that  That's part of you up there. That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals.  In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life  I started storm chasing in      after my daughter said   Mom  you should do that.  And so three days later  driving very fast  I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell  capable of producing grapefruit size hail and spectacular tornadoes  although only two percent actually do. These clouds can grow so big  up to    miles wide and reach up to        feet into the atmosphere. They can grow so big  blocking all daylight  making it very dark and ominous standing under them. Storm chasing is a very tactile experience. There's a warm  moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth  the wheat  the grass  the charged particles. And then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming  the greens and the turquoise blues. I've learned to respect the lightning. My hair used to be straight. I'm just kidding. What really excites me about these storms is their movement  the way they swirl and spin and undulate  with their lava lamp like mammatus clouds. They become lovely monsters. When I'm photographing them  I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson. As I stand under them  I see not just a cloud  but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces  the same process in a small scale version that helped to create our galaxy  our solar system  our sun and even this very planet. All my relations. Thank you. Writing biography is a strange thing to do. It's a journey into the foreign territory of somebody else's life  a journey  an exploration that can take you places you never dreamed of going and still can't quite believe you've been  especially if  like me  you're an agnostic Jew and the life you've been exploring is that of Muhammad. Five years ago  for instance  I found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle to what I knew was an impossible question  What actually happened one desert night  half the world and almost half of history away  What happened  that is  on the night in the year     when Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran on a mountain just outside Mecca  This is the core mystical moment of Islam  and as such  of course  it defies empirical analysis. Yet the question wouldn't let go of me. I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am  just asking it could be seen as pure chutzpah. And I plead guilty as charged  because all exploration  physical or intellectual  is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression  of crossing boundaries. Still  some boundaries are larger than others. So a human encountering the divine  as Muslims believe Muhammad did  to the rationalist  this is a matter not of fact but of wishful fiction  and like all of us  I like to think of myself as rational. Which might be why when I looked at the earliest accounts we have of that night  what struck me even more than what happened was what did not happen. Muhammad did not come floating off the mountain as though walking on air. He did not run down shouting   Hallelujah   and  Bless the Lord   He did not radiate light and joy. There were no choirs of angels  no music of the spheres  no elation  no ecstasy  no golden aura surrounding him  no sense of an absolute  fore ordained role as the messenger of God. That is  he did none of the things that might make it easy to cry foul  to put down the whole story as a pious fable. Quite the contrary. In his own reported words  he was convinced at first that what had happened couldn't have been real. At best  he thought  it had to have been a hallucination    a trick of the eye or the ear  perhaps  or his own mind working against him. At worst  possession    that he'd been seized by an evil jinn  a spirit out to deceive him  even to crush the life out of him. In fact  he was so sure that he could only be majnun  possessed by a jinn  that when he found himself still alive  his first impulse was to finish the job himself  to leap off the highest cliff and escape the terror of what he'd experienced by putting an end to all experience. So the man who fled down the mountain that night trembled not with joy but with a stark  primordial fear. He was overwhelmed not with conviction  but by doubt. And that panicked disorientation  that sundering of everything familiar  that daunting awareness of something beyond human comprehension  can only be called a terrible awe. This might be somewhat difficult to grasp now that we use the word  awesome  to describe a new app or a viral video. With the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake  we're protected from real awe. We close the doors and hunker down  convinced that we're in control  or  at least  hoping for control. We do our best to ignore the fact that we don't always have it  and that not everything can be explained. Yet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic  whether you think the words Muhammad heard that night came from inside himself or from outside  what's clear is that he did experience them  and that he did so with a force that would shatter his sense of himself and his world and transform this otherwise modest man into a radical advocate for social and economic justice. Fear was the only sane response  the only human response. Too human for some  like conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that the account of his wanting to kill himself shouldn't even be mentioned  despite the fact that it's in the earliest Islamic biographies. They insist that he never doubted for even a single moment  let alone despaired. Demanding perfection  they refuse to tolerate human imperfection. Yet what  exactly  is imperfect about doubt  As I read those early accounts  I realized it was precisely Muhammad's doubt that brought him alive for me  that allowed me to begin to see him in full  to accord him the integrity of reality. And the more I thought about it  the more it made sense that he doubted  because doubt is essential to faith. If this seems a startling idea at first  consider that doubt  as Graham Greene once put it  is the heart of the matter. Abolish all doubt  and what's left is not faith  but absolute  heartless conviction. You're certain that you possess the Truth    inevitably offered with an implied uppercase T    and this certainty quickly devolves into dogmatism and righteousness  by which I mean a demonstrative  overweening pride in being so very right  in short  the arrogance of fundamentalism. It has to be one of the multiple ironies of history that a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists is the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists known as Crusaders   infidel   from the Latin for  faithless.  Doubly ironic  in this case  because their absolutism is in fact the opposite of faith. In effect  they are the infidels. Like fundamentalists of all religious stripes  they have no questions  only answers. They found the perfect antidote to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith. They don't have to struggle for it like Jacob wrestling through the night with the angel  or like Jesus in his    days and nights in the wilderness  or like Muhammad  not only that night on the mountain  but throughout his years as a prophet  with the Koran constantly urging him not to despair  and condemning those who most loudly proclaim that they know everything there is to know and that they and they alone are right. And yet we  the vast and still far too silent majority  have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority. We've allowed Judaism to be claimed by violently messianic West Bank settlers  Christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots  Islam by suicide bombers. And we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that no matter whether they claim to be Christians  Jews or Muslims  militant extremists are none of the above. They're a cult all their own  blood brothers steeped in other people's blood. This isn't faith. It's fanaticism  and we have to stop confusing the two. We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers. It's difficult and stubborn. It involves an ongoing struggle  a continual questioning of what we think we know  a wrestling with issues and ideas. It goes hand in hand with doubt  in a never ending conversation with it  and sometimes in conscious defiance of it. And this conscious defiance is why I  as an agnostic  can still have faith. I have faith  for instance  that peace in the Middle East is possible despite the ever accumulating mass of evidence to the contrary. I'm not convinced of this. I can hardly say I believe it. I can only have faith in it  commit myself  that is  to the idea of it  and I do this precisely because of the temptation to throw up my hands in resignation and retreat into silence. Because despair is self fulfilling. If we call something impossible  we act in such a way that we make it so. And I  for one  refuse to live that way. In fact  most of us do  whether we're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond  for that matter  what drives us is that  despite our doubts and even because of our doubts  we reject the nihilism of despair. We insist on faith in the future and in each other. Call this naive if you like. Call it impossibly idealistic if you must. But one thing is sure  Call it human. Could Muhammad have so radically changed his world without such faith  without the refusal to cede to the arrogance of closed minded certainty  I think not. After keeping company with him as a writer for the past five years  I can't see that he'd be anything but utterly outraged at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak and act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today. He'd be appalled at the repression of half the population because of their gender. He'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism. He'd call out terrorism for what it is  not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he believed in and struggled for. He'd say what the Koran says  Anyone who takes a life takes the life of all humanity. Anyone who saves a life  saves the life of all humanity. And he'd commit himself fully to the hard and thorny process of making peace. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  I'll never forget that day back in the spring of     . I was a surgical resident at The Johns Hopkins Hospital  taking emergency call. I got paged by the E.R. around   in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot. I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as I pulled the curtain back to see her. And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital. That wasn't being asked. The question that was being asked of me was a different one  which was  did she also need an amputation  Now  looking back on that night  I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I'd shown the    year old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer. In her case  I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to save her life. The cancer was too advanced. But I was committed to making sure that I could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee. I brought some for her parents. But more importantly  see  I passed no judgment on her  because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself. So why was it that  just a few nights later  as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation  why did I hold her in such bitter contempt  You see  unlike the woman the night before  this woman had type   diabetes. She was fat. And we all know that's from eating too much and not exercising enough  right  I mean  how hard can it be  As I looked down at her in the bed  I thought to myself  if you just tried caring even a little bit  you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you've never met about to amputate your foot. Why did I feel justified in judging her  I'd like to say I don't know. But I actually do. You see  in the hubris of my youth  I thought I had her all figured out. She ate too much. She got unlucky. She got diabetes. Case closed. Ironically  at that time in my life  I was also doing cancer research  immune based therapies for melanoma  to be specific  and in that world I was actually taught to question everything  to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards. Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma  I never once questioned the conventional wisdom. I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science. Three years later  I found out how wrong I was. But this time  I was the patient. Despite exercising three or four hours every single day  and following the food pyramid to the letter  I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome. Some of you may have heard of this. I had become insulin resistant. You can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat  whether we burn it or store it. This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo. Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life. And insulin resistance  as its name suggests  is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job. Once you're insulin resistant  you're on your way to getting diabetes  which is what happens when your pancreas can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin. Now your blood sugar levels start to rise  and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease  cancer  even Alzheimer's disease  and amputations  just like that woman a few years earlier. With that scare  I got busy changing my diet radically  adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking. I did this and lost    pounds  weirdly while exercising less. I  as you can see  I guess I'm not overweight anymore. More importantly  I don't have insulin resistance. But most important  I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away  How did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right  If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me  was it possible it was failing someone else  And underlying these questions  I became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance. Now  most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance. Logically  then  if you want to treat insulin resistance  you get people to lose weight  right  You treat the obesity. But what if we have it backwards  What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all  In fact  what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem  the tip of a proverbial iceberg  I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic  but hear me out. What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell  I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign  but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils. You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of our cells to partition fuel  as I alluded to a moment ago  taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately. When we become insulin resistant  the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state. So now  when insulin says to a cell  I want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe  the cell  in effect  says   No thanks  I'd actually rather store this energy.  And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells  it's probably the safest place to store it. So for many of us  about    million Americans  the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat  not the reverse  getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat. This is a really subtle distinction  but the implication could be profound. Consider the following analogy  Think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table. Sure  the bruise hurts like hell  and you almost certainly don't like the discolored look  but we all know the bruise per Se is not the problem. In fact  it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma  all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body. Now  imagine we thought bruises were the problem  and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises  masking creams  painkillers  you name it  all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables. How much better would we be if we treated the cause    telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room    rather than the effect  Getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world. Getting it wrong  and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins. Cause and effect. So what I'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance. Maybe we should be asking ourselves  is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity  at least in most people  What if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening  an underlying epidemic  the one we ought to be worried about  Let's look at some suggestive facts. We know that    million obese Americans in the United States don't have insulin resistance. And by the way  they don't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people. Conversely  we know that six million lean people in the United States are insulin resistant  and by the way  they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts. Now I don't know why  but it might be because  in their case  their cells haven't actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy. So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance  and you can be lean and have it  this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what's going on. So what if we're fighting the wrong war  fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance  Even worse  what if blaming the obese means we're blaming the victims  What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong  Personally  I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore  let alone the luxury of certainty. I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this  but I'm wide open to others. Now  my hypothesis  because everybody always asks me  is this. If you ask yourself  what's a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant  the answer probably isn't too much food. It's more likely too much glucose  blood sugar. Now  we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run  and there's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly. So if you put these physiological processes to work  I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains  sugars and starches that's driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes  but through insulin resistance  you see  and not necessarily through just overeating and under exercising. When I lost my    pounds a few years ago  I did it simply by restricting those things  which admittedly suggests I have a bias based on my personal experience. But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong  and most important  all of this can be tested scientifically. But step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity  diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested. I'm betting my career on this. Today  I devote all of my time to working on this problem  and I'll go wherever the science takes me. I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don't. I've been humbled enough by all I don't know. For the past year  I've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country  and the best part is  just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals  we've done the same thing. We've recruited a team of scientific rivals  the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what's at the heart of this epidemic. Some think it's too many calories consumed. Others think it's too much dietary fat. Others think it's too many refined grains and starches. But this team of multi disciplinary  highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things. First  this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer. And two  if we're willing to be wrong  if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer  we can solve this problem. I know it's tempting to want an answer right now  some form of action or policy  some dietary prescription    eat this  not that   but if we want to get it right  we're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription. Briefly  to address this  our research program is focused around three meta themes  or questions. First  how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism  hormones and enzymes  and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms  Second  based on these insights  can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that's safe and practical to implement  And finally  once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet  how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception  Just because you know what to do doesn't mean you're always going to do it. Sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier  and believe it or not  that can be studied scientifically. I don't know how this journey is going to end  but this much seems clear to me  at least  We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did. Most of them actually want to do the right thing  but they have to know what that is  and it's got to work. I dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance  because as medical professionals  we've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals  open minds  the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas when they don't appear to be working  and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final  but constantly evolving. Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science. If obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness  what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy  Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R. seven years ago. I wish I could speak with that woman again. I'd like to tell her how sorry I am. I'd say  as a doctor  I delivered the best clinical care I could  but as a human being  I let you down. You didn't need my judgment and my contempt. You needed my empathy and compassion  and above all else  you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn't let the system down. Maybe the system  of which I was a part  was letting you down. If you're watching this now  I hope you can forgive me. I'm going to be talking about designing humor  which is sort of an interesting thing  but it goes to some of the discussions about constraints  and how in certain contexts  humor is right  and in other contexts it's wrong. Now  I'm from New York  so it's     percent satisfaction here. Actually  that's ridiculous  because when it comes to humor     percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for. Nobody is ever satisfied     percent with humor except this woman. Bob Mankoff  That's my first wife. That part of the relationship went fine. Now let's look at this cartoon. One of the things I'm pointing out is that cartoons appear within the context of The New Yorker magazine  that lovely Caslon type  and it seems like a fairly benign cartoon within this context. It's making a little bit fun of getting older  and  you know  people might like it. But like I said  you cannot satisfy everyone. You couldn't satisfy this guy.  Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit. It's nice  I'm sure to be young and rude  but some day you'll be old  unless you drop dead as I wish.  The New Yorker is rather a sensitive environment  very easy for people to get their nose out of joint. And one of the things that you realize is it's an unusual environment. Here I'm one person talking to you. You're all collective. You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh. In The New Yorker  it goes out to a wide audience  and when you actually look at that  and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at  and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor is really interesting. Let's look at this cartoon.  Discouraging data on the antidepressant.  Indeed  it is discouraging. Now  you would think  well  look  most of you laughed at that. Right  You thought it was funny. In general  that seems like a funny cartoon  but let's look what online survey I did. Generally  about    percent of the people liked it. A hundred and nine voted it a     the highest. Ten voted it one. But look at the individual responses.  I like animals       Look how much they like them.  I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me.  This person rated it a two.  I don't like to see animals suffer    even in cartoons.  To people like this  I point out we use anesthetic ink. Other people thought it was funny. That actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor when you don't have the contagion of humor. Humor is a type of entertainment. All entertainment contains a little frisson of danger  something that might happen wrong  and yet we like it when there's protection. That's what a zoo is. It's danger. The tiger is there. The bars protect us. That's sort of fun  right  That's a bad zoo. It's a very politically correct zoo  but it's a bad zoo. But this is a worse one. So in dealing with humor in the context of The New Yorker  you have to see  where is that tiger going to be  Where is the danger going to exist  How are you going to manage it  My job is to look at       cartoons a week. But The New Yorker only can take    or    cartoons  and we have       cartoons. Of course  many  many cartoons must be rejected. Now  we could fit more cartoons in the magazine if we removed the articles. But I feel that would be a huge loss  one I could live with  but still huge. Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week. The average cartoonist who stays with the magazine does    or    ideas every week. But they mostly are going to be rejected. That's the nature of any creative activity. Many of them fade away. Some of them stay. Matt Diffee is one of them. Here's one of his cartoons. Drew Dernavich.  Accounting night at the improv.   Now is the part of the show when we ask the audience to shout out some random numbers.  Paul Noth.  He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro Israel.  Now I know all about rejection  because when I quit    actually  I was booted out of    psychology school and decided to become a cartoonist  a natural segue  from      to      I submitted       cartoons to The New Yorker  and got       cartoons rejected by The New Yorker. At a certain point  this rejection slip  in          We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.    magically changed to this.  Hey  You sold one. No shit  You really sold a cartoon to the fucking New Yorker magazine.  Now of course that's not what happened  but that's the emotional truth. And of course  that is not New Yorker humor. What is New Yorker humor  Well  after       I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons. Finally  in       I received the revered New Yorker contract  which I blurred out parts because it's none of your business. From     .  Dear Mr. Mankoff  confirming the agreement there of      blah blah blah blah    blur     for any idea drawings.  With respect to idea drawings  nowhere in the contract is the word  cartoon  mentioned. The word  idea drawings   and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons. So what is an idea drawing  An idea drawing is something that requires you to think. Now that's not a cartoon. It requires thinking on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part to make it into a cartoon. Here are some  generally you get my cast of cartoon mind.  There is no justice in the world. There is some justice in the world. The world is just.  This is What Lemmings Believe. The New Yorker and I  when we made comments  the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is. What is it  the cartoon  Is it really about lemmings  No. It's about us. You know  it's my view basically about religion  that the real conflict and all the fights between religion is who has the best imaginary friend. And this is my most well known cartoon.  No  Thursday's out. How about never   is never good for you   It's been reprinted thousands of times  totally ripped off. It's even on thongs  but compressed to  How about never   is never good for you   Now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great similarity. In each instance  our expectations are defied. In each instance  the narrative gets switched. There's an incongruity and a contrast. In  No  Thursday's out. How about never   is never good for you   what you have is the syntax of politeness and the message of being rude. That really is how humor works. It's a cognitive synergy where we mash up these two things which don't go together and temporarily in our minds exist. He is both being polite and rude. In here  you have the propriety of The New Yorker and the vulgarity of the language. Basically  that's the way humor works. So I'm a humor analyst  you would say. Now E.B. White said  analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog. Nobody is much interested  and the frog dies. Well  I'm going to kill a few  but there won't be any genocide. But really  it makes me   Let's look at this picture. This is an interesting picture  The Laughing Audience. There are the people  fops up there  but everybody is laughing  everybody is laughing except one guy. This guy. Who is he  He's the critic. He's the critic of humor  and really I'm forced to be in that position  when I'm at The New Yorker  and that's the danger that I will become this guy. Now here's a little video made by Matt Diffee  sort of how they imagine if we really exaggerated that. Ehhh. Oooh. Hmm. Too funny. Normally I would but I'm in a pissy mood. I'll enjoy it on my own. Perhaps. No. Nah. No. Overdrawn. Underdrawn. Drawn just right  still not funny enough. No. No. For God's sake no  a thousand times no. No. No. No. No. No.  Four hours later  Hey  that's good  yeah  whatcha got there  Office worker  Got a ham and swiss on rye BM  No. Office worker  Okay. Pastrami on sourdough BM  No. Office worker  Smoked turkey with bacon BM  No. Office worker  Falafel BM  Let me look at it. Eh  no. Office worker  Grilled cheese BM  No. Office worker  BLT BM  No. Office worker  Black forest ham and mozzarella with apple mustard BM  No. Office worker  Green bean salad BM  No. No. No. Definitely no.  Several hours after lunch  No. Get out of here. That's sort of an exaggeration of what I do. Now  we do reject  many  many  many cartoons  so many that there are many books called  The Rejection Collection.   The Rejection Collection  is not quite New Yorker kind of humor. And you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking. See  that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor. It's actually put together by Matt Diffee  one of our cartoonists. So I'll give you some examples of rejection collection humor.  I'm thinking about having a child.  There you have an interesting    the guilty laugh  the laugh against your better judgment.  Ass head. Please help.  Now  in fact  within a context of this book  which says   Cartoons you never saw and never will see in The New Yorker   this humor is perfect. I'm going to explain why. There's a concept about humor about it being a benign violation. In other words  for something to be funny  we've got to think it's both wrong and also okay at the same time. If we think it's completely wrong  we say   That's not funny.  And if it's completely okay  what's the joke  Okay  And so  this benign  that's true of  No  Thursday's out. How about never   is never good for you   It's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way. Within that context  we feel it's okay. So within this context   Asshead. Please help  is a benign violation. Within the context of The New Yorker magazine ...  T Cell Army  Can the body's immune response help treat cancer   Oh  goodness. You're reading about this smart stuff  this intelligent dissection of the immune system. You glance over at this  and it says   Asshead. Please help   God. So there the violation is malign. It doesn't work. There is no such thing as funny in and of itself. Everything will be within the context and our expectations. One way to look at it is this. It's sort of called a meta motivational theory about how we look  a theory about motivation and the mood we're in and how the mood we're in determines the things we like or dislike. When we're in a playful mood  we want excitement. We want high arousal. We feel excited then. If we're in a purposeful mood  that makes us anxious.  The Rejection Collection  is absolutely in this field. You want to be stimulated. You want to be aroused. You want to be transgressed. It's like this  like an amusement park. Voice  Here we go.  Screams  He laughs. He is both in danger and safe  incredibly aroused. There's no joke. No joke needed. If you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough  they will laugh at very  very little. This is another cartoon from  The Rejection Collection.   Too snug   That's a cartoon about terrorism. The New Yorker occupies a very different space. It's a space that is playful in its own way  and also purposeful  and in that space  the cartoons are different. Now I'm going to show you cartoons The New Yorker did right after       a very  very sensitive area when humor could be used. How would The New Yorker attack it  It would not be with a guy with a bomb saying   Too snug   Or there was another cartoon I didn't show because actually I thought maybe people would be offended. The great Sam Gross cartoon  this happened after the Muhammad controversy where it's Muhammad in heaven  the suicide bomber is all in little pieces  and he's saying to the suicide bomber   You'll get the virgins when we find your penis.  Better left undrawn. The first week we did no cartoons. That was a black hole for humor  and correctly so. It's not always appropriate every time. But the next week  this was the first cartoon.  I thought I'd never laugh again. Then I saw your jacket.  It basically was about  if we were alive  we were going to laugh. We were going to breathe. We were going to exist. Here's another one.  I figure if I don't have that third martini  then the terrorists win.  These cartoons are not about them. They're about us. The humor reflects back on us. The easiest thing to do with humor  and it's perfectly legitimate  is a friend makes fun of an enemy. It's called dispositional humor. It's    percent of the humor. It's not our humor. Here's another cartoon.  I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state.  Humor does need a target. But interestingly  in The New Yorker  the target is us. The target is the readership and the people who do it. The humor is self reflective and makes us think about our assumptions. Look at this cartoon by Roz Chast  the guy reading the obituary.  Two years younger than you     years older than you  three years your junior  your age on the dot  exactly your age.  That is a deeply profound cartoon. And so The New Yorker is also trying to  in some way  make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us. Here's another one.  I started my vegetarianism for health reasons  Then it became a moral choice  and now it's just to annoy people.   Excuse me   I think there's something wrong with this in a tiny way that no one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint.  So it focuses on our obsessions  our narcissism  our foils and our foibles  really not someone else's. The New Yorker demands some cognitive work on your part  and what it demands is what Arthur Koestler  who wrote  The Act of Creation  about the relationship between humor  art and science  is what's called bisociation. You have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference  and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon. If the different frames of reference don't come together in about .  seconds  it's not funny  but I think they will for you here. Different frames of reference.  You slept with her  didn't you    Lassie  Get help    It's called French Army Knife. And this is Einstein in bed.  To you it was fast.  Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling. Like  this cartoon would puzzle many people. How many people know what this cartoon means  The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk. This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog. That's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year called  I Don't Get It  The New Yorker Cartoon I.Q. Test.  The other thing The New Yorker plays around with is incongruity  and incongruity  I've shown you  is sort of the basis of humor. Something that's completely normal or logical isn't going to be funny. But the way incongruity works is  observational humor is humor within the realm of reality.  My boss is always telling me what to do.  Okay  That could happen. It's humor within the realm of reality. Here  cowboy to a cow   Very impressive. I'd like to find       more like you.  We understand that. It's absurd. But we're putting the two together. Here  in the nonsense range   Damn it  Hopkins  didn't you get yesterday's memo   Now that's a little puzzling  right  It doesn't quite come together. In general  people who enjoy more nonsense  enjoy more abstract art  they tend to be liberal  less conservative  that type of stuff. But for us  and for me  helping design the humor  it doesn't make any sense to compare one to the other. It's sort of a smorgasbord that's made all interesting. So I want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon  and I think this sums up the whole thing  really  about The New Yorker cartoons.  It sort of makes you stop and think  doesn't it.  And now  when you look at New Yorker cartoons  I'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about them. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  I do want to test this question we're all interested in  Does extinction have to be forever  I'm focused on two projects I want to tell you about. One is the Thylacine Project. The other one is the Lazarus Project  and that's focused on the gastric brooding frog. And it would be a fair question to ask  why have we focused on these two animals  Well  point number one  each of them represents a unique family of its own. We've lost a whole family. That's a big chunk of the global genome gone. I'd like it back. The second reason is that we killed these things. In the case of the thylacine  regrettably  we shot every one that we saw. We slaughtered them. In the case of the gastric brooding frog  we may have  fungicided  it to death. There's a dreadful fungus that's moving through the world that's called the chytrid fungus  and it's nailing frogs all over the world. We think that's probably what got this frog  and humans are spreading this fungus. And this introduces a very important ethical point  and I think you will have heard this many times when this topic comes up. What I think is important is that  if it's clear that we exterminated these species  then I think we not only have a moral obligation to see what we can do about it  but I think we've got a moral imperative to try to do something  if we can. OK. Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project. It's a frog. And you think  frog. Yeah  but this was not just any frog. Unlike a normal frog  which lays its eggs in the water and goes away and wishes its froglets well  this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs  swallowed them into the stomach  where it should be having food  didn't digest the eggs  and turned its stomach into a uterus. In the stomach  the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles  and in the stomach  the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs  and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart. It has a little cough and a hiccup  and out comes sprays of little frogs. Now  when biologists saw this  they were agog. They thought  this is incredible. No animal  let alone a frog  has been known to do this  to change one organ in the body into another. And you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well. If we could understand how that frog is managing the way its tummy works  is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use to help ourselves  Now  I'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach  but I am suggesting it's possible we might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut. And just as everybody got excited about it  bang  It was extinct. I called up my friend  Professor Mike Tyler in the University of Adelaide. He was the last person who had this frog  a colony of these things  in his lab. And I said   Mike  by any chance     This was    or    years ago.  By any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog   And he thought about it  and he went to his deep freezer  minus    degrees centigrade  and he poured through everything in the freezer  and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs. This was very exciting  but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work  because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it  cryoprotectants  to look after it when it was frozen. And normally  when water freezes  as you know  it expands  and the same thing happens in a cell. If you freeze tissues  the water expands  damages or bursts the cell walls. Well  we looked at the tissue under the microscope. It actually didn't look bad. The cell walls looked intact. So we thought  let's give it a go. What we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation. We took the eggs of a related species  a living frog  and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg. We used ultraviolet radiation to do that. And then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei into that egg. Now  by rights  this is kind of like a cloning project  like what produced Dolly  but it's actually very different  because Dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells. That was a miracle  but it was workable. What we're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species and put it into a completely different species and expect that to work. Well  we had no real reason to expect it would  and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these. And just last February  the last time we did these trials  I saw a miracle starting to happen. What we found was most of these eggs didn't work  but then suddenly  one of them began to divide. That was so exciting. And then the egg divided again. And then again. And pretty soon  we had early stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those. We even DNA tested some of these cells  and the DNA of the extinct frog is in those cells. So we're very excited. This is not a tadpole. It's not a frog. But it's a long way along the journey to producing  or bringing back  an extinct species. And this is news. We haven't announced this publicly before. We're excited. We've got to get past this point. We now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate  to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues. It'll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog. Watch this space. I think we're going to have this frog hopping glad to be back in the world again. Thank you. We haven't done it yet  but keep the applause ready. The second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project. The thylacine looks a bit  to most people  like a dog  or maybe like a tiger  because it has stripes. But it's not related to any of those. It's a marsupial. It raised its young in a pouch  like a koala or a kangaroo would do  and it has a long history  a long  fascinating history  that goes back    million years. But it's also a tragic history. The first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia about    million years ago  and the National Geographic Society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits. This is Riversleigh. In those fossil rocks are some amazing animals. We found marsupial lions. We found carnivorous kangaroos. It's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo  but these are meat eating kangaroos. We found the biggest bird in the world  bigger than that thing that was in Madagascar  and it too was a flesh eater. It was a giant  weird duck. And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either. You think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing  sitting in a pool of water. These crocodiles were actually out on the land and they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey on the ground. We had  in Australia  drop crocs. They really do exist. But what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals but also thylacines. There were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests  and they ranged from great big ones to middle sized ones to one that was about the size of a chihuahua. Paris Hilton would have been able to carry one of these things around in a little handbag  until a drop croc landed on her. At any rate  it was a fascinating place  but unfortunately  Australia didn't stay this way. Climate change has affected the world for a long period of time  and gradually  the forests disappeared  the country began to dry out  and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline  until by five million years ago  only one left. By        years ago  they had disappeared from New Guinea  and unfortunately  by       years ago  somebodies  we don't know who this was  introduced dingoes    this is a very archaic kind of a dog    into Australia. And as you can see  dingoes are very similar in their body form to thylacines. That similarity meant they probably competed. They were eating the same kinds of foods. It's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes as pets  and therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival. All we know is  soon after the dingoes were brought in  thylacines were extinct in the Australian mainland  and after that they only survived in Tasmania. Then  unfortunately  the next sad part of the thylacine story is that Europeans arrived in       and they brought with them the things they valued  and that included sheep. They took one look at the thylacine in Tasmania  and they thought  hang on  this is not going to work. That guy is going to eat all our sheep. That was not what happened  actually. Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep  but the thylacine got a bad rap. But immediately  the government said  that's it  let's get rid of them  and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw. By the early     s        to       thylacines had been murdered. It was a disaster  and they were about to hit the wall. Have a look at this bit of film footage. It makes me very sad because  while it's a fascinating animal  and it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction  we didn't  unfortunately  at this same time  have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species. These are photos of the last surviving thylacine  Benjamin  who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart. To add insult to injury  having swept this species nearly off the table  this animal  when it died of neglect    The keepers didn't let it into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart. It died of exposure  and in the morning  when they found the body of Benjamin  they still cared so little for this animal that they threw the body in the dump. Does it have to stay this way  In       I was in the Australian Museum. I was fascinated by thylacines. I've always been obsessed with these animals. And I was studying skulls  trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals  and I saw this jar  and here  in the jar  was a little girl thylacine pup  perhaps six months old. The guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup  and they pickled it in alcohol. I'm a paleontologist  but I still knew alcohol was a DNA preservative. But this was       and I asked my geneticist friends  couldn't we think about going into this pup and extracting DNA  if it's there  and then somewhere down the line in the future  we'll use this DNA to bring the thylacine back  The geneticists laughed. But this was six years before Dolly. Cloning was science fiction. It had not happened. But then suddenly cloning did happen. And I thought  when I became director of the Australian Museum  I'm going to give this a go. I put a team together. We went into that pup to see what was in it  and we did find thylacine DNA. It was a eureka moment. We were very excited. Unfortunately  we also found a lot of human DNA. Every old curator who'd been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen  put their hand in the jar  pulled it out and thought   Wow  look at that   plop  dropped it back in the jar  contaminating this specimen. And that was a worry. If the goal here was to get the DNA out and use the DNA down the track to try to bring a thylacine back  what we didn't want happening when the information was shoved into the machine and the wheel turned around and the lights flashed  was to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine. It would've kept the curator very happy  but it wasn't going to keep us happy. So we went back to these specimens and we started digging around  and particularly  we looked into the teeth of skulls  hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers  and we found much better quality DNA. We found nuclear mitochondrial genes. It's there. So we got it. OK. What could we do with this stuff  Well  George Church  in his book   Regenesis   has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented DNA. We would hope that we'll be able to get that DNA back into a viable form  and then  much like we've done with the Lazarus Project  get that stuff into an egg of a host species. It has to be a different species. What could it be  Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil  They're related  distantly  to thylacines. And then the Tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end. Critics of this project say  hang on. Thylacine  Tasmanian devil  That's going to hurt. No  it's not. These are marsupials. They give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean. That Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth. It is  shortly  going to think it's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world  so maybe it'll need some help to keep it going. Andrew Pask and his colleagues have demonstrated this might not be a waste of time. And it's sort of in the future  we haven't got there yet  but it's the kind of thing we want to think about. They took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA and they spliced it into a mouse genome  but they put a tag on it so that anything that this thylacine DNA produced would appear blue green in the mouse baby. In other words  if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA  it would be able to be recognized. When the baby popped up  it was filled with blue green tissues. And that tells us if we can get that genome back together  get it into a live cell  it's going to produce thylacine stuff. Is this a risk  You've taken the bits of one animal and you've mixed them into the cell of a different kind of an animal. Are we going to get a Frankenstein  Some kind of weird hybrid chimera  And the answer is no. If the only nuclear DNA that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA  that's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil. OK  if we can do this  could we put it back  This is a key question for everybody. Does it have to stay in a laboratory  or could we put it back where it belongs  Could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in Tasmania  restore that ecosystem  Or has Tasmania changed so much that that's no longer possible  I've been to Tasmania. I've been to many of the areas where the thylacines were common. I've even spoken to people  like Peter Carter here  who when I spoke to him  was    years old  but in       this man and his father and his brother caught thylacines. They trapped them. And when I spoke to this man  I was looking in his eyes and thinking   Behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like  what they smelled like  what they sounded like.  He led them around on a rope. He has personal experiences that I would give my left leg to have in my head. We'd all love to have this sort of thing happen. Anyway  I asked Peter  by any chance  could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines. My interest was in whether the environment had changed. He thought hard. It was nearly    years before this that he'd been at this hut. At any rate  he led us down this bush track  and there  right where he remembered  was the hut  and tears came into his eyes. He looked at the hut. We went inside. There were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut where he and his father and his brother had slept at night. And he told me  as it all was flooding back in memories. He said   I remember the thylacines going around the hut wondering what was inside   and he said they made sounds like  Yip  Yip  Yip   All of these are parts of his life and what he remembers. And the key question for me was to ask Peter  has it changed  And he said no. The southern beech forests surrounded his hut just like it was when he was there in     . The grasslands were sweeping away. That's classic thylacine habitat. And the animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around. So could we put it back  Yes. Is that all we would do  And this is an interesting question. Sometimes you might be able to put it back  but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again  And I don't think so. I think gradually  as we see species all around the world  it's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild. We'd love to think it is  but we know it isn't. We need other parallel strategies coming online. And this one interests me. Some of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos  sanctuaries  even at the museums  had collar marks on the neck. They were being kept as pets  and we know a lot of bush tales and memories of people who had them as pets  and they say they were wonderful  friendly. This particular one came in out of the forest to lick this boy and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep. A wild animal. And I'd like to ask the question. We need to think about this. If it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then  would the thylacine be extinct now  And I'm positive it wouldn't. We need to think about this in today's world. Could it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them  maybe they won't go extinct  And this is such a critical issue for us because if we don't do that  we're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice. As far as I'm concerned  this is why we're trying to do these kinds of de extinction projects. We are trying to restore that balance of nature that we have upset. Thank you. Well  Arthur C. Clarke  a famous science fiction writer from the     s  said that   We overestimate technology in the short term  and we underestimate it in the long term.  And I think that's some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots. That we're overestimating the technology in the short term. But I am worried whether we're going to get the technology we need in the long term. Because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing and that we  our society  is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future. So I'm scared we won't have enough robots. But fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time. Back in       there was a Spencer Tracy  Katharine Hepburn movie. So you know how it ended up  Spencer Tracy brought a computer  a mainframe computer of       in to help the librarians. The librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives   What are the names of Santa's reindeer   And they would look that up. And this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job. Well of course a mainframe computer in      wasn't much use for that job. The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear. But that's not what happened in fact. The number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after     . It wasn't until the Internet came into play  the web came into play and search engines came into play that the need for librarians went down. And I think everyone from      totally underestimated the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today. And we can just ask   What are the names of Santa's reindeer   and be told instantly    or anything else we want to ask. By the way  the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the U.S. over that same time period  because librarians became partners of computers. Computers became tools  and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time. Same thing happened in offices. Back in the old days  people used spreadsheets. Spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper  and they calculated by hand. But here was an interesting thing that came along. With the revolution around      of P.C.'s  the spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers  not to replace office workers  but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers. So office workers became programmers of spreadsheets. It increased their capabilities. They no longer had to do the mundane computations  but they could do something much more. Now today  we're starting to see robots in our lives. On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot. When soldiers came across roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan  instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick  as they used to do up until about       they now send the robot out. So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs. On the right are some TUGs from a company called Aethon in Pittsburgh. These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S. And they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry. They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen. They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy. And it frees up the nurses and the nurse's aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients. In fact  robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways. But I think when it comes to factory robots  people are sort of afraid  because factory robots are dangerous to be around. In order to program them  you have to understand six dimensional vectors and quaternions. And ordinary people can't interact with them. And I think it's the sort of technology that's gone wrong. It's displaced the worker from the technology. And I think we really have to look at technologies that ordinary workers can interact with. And so I want to tell you today about Baxter  which we've been talking about. And Baxter  I see  as a way    a first wave of robot that ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting. So Baxter is up here. This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics. We've got a conveyor there. And if the lighting isn't too extreme    Ah  ah  There it is. It's picked up the object off the conveyor. It's going to come bring it over here and put it down. And then it'll go back  reach for another object. The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense. By the way  what's going on with the eyes  The eyes are on the screen there. The eyes look ahead where the robot's going to move. So a person that's interacting with the robot understands where it's going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions. Here Chris took the object out of its hand  and Baxter didn't go and try to put it down  it went back and realized it had to get another one. It's got a little bit of basic common sense  goes and picks the objects. And Baxter's safe to interact with. You wouldn't want to do this with a current industrial robot. But with Baxter it doesn't hurt. It feels the force  understands that Chris is there and doesn't push through him and hurt him. But I think the most interesting thing about Baxter is the user interface. And so Chris is going to come and grab the other arm now. And when he grabs an arm  it goes into zero force gravity compensated mode and graphics come up on the screen. You can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm. He's going to put something in its hand  he's going to bring it over here  press a button and let go of that thing in the hand. And the robot figures out  ah  he must mean I want to put stuff down. It puts a little icon there. He comes over here  and he gets the fingers to grasp together  and the robot infers  ah  you want an object for me to pick up. That puts the green icon there. He's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from. It just moves it around  and the robot figures out that was an area search. He didn't have to select that from a menu. And now he's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object while we continue talking. So as we continue here  I want to tell you about what this is like in factories. These robots we're shipping every day. They go to factories around the country. This is Mildred. Mildred's a factory worker in Connecticut. She's worked on the line for over    years. One hour after she saw her first industrial robot  she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory. She decided she really liked robots. And it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand. Now she's got the robot doing it. When we first went out to talk to people in factories about how we could get robots to interact with them better  one of the questions we asked them was   Do you want your children to work in a factory   The universal answer was  No  I want a better job than that for my children.  And as a result of that  Mildred is very typical of today's factory workers in the U.S. They're older  and they're getting older and older. There aren't many young people coming into factory work. And as their tasks become more onerous on them  we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with  so that they can be part of the solution  so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the U.S. And so our vision is that Mildred who's the line worker becomes Mildred the robot trainer. She lifts her game  like the office workers of the     s lifted their game of what they could do. We're not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use. They're tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes. There's two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable. That's climate change and demographics. Demographics is really going to change our world. This is the percentage of adults who are working age. And it's gone down slightly over the last    years. But over the next    years  it's going to change dramatically  even in China. The percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically. And turned up the other way  the people who are retirement age goes up very  very fast  as the baby boomers get to retirement age. That means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars competing for services. But more than that  as we get older we get more frail and we can't do all the tasks we used to do. If we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers  before our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older. That's happening statistically right now. And as the number of people who are older  above retirement age and getting older  as they increase  there will be less people to take care of them. And I think we're really going to have to have robots to help us. And I don't mean robots in terms of companions. I mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older. Getting the groceries in from the car  up the stairs  into the kitchen. Or even  as we get very much older  driving our cars to go visit people. And I think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control of the robotic solution. So they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them. And so I really think that we're going to be spending more time with robots like Baxter and working with robots like Baxter in our daily lives. And that we will    Here  Baxter  it's good. And that we will all come to rely on robots over the next    years as part of our everyday lives. Thanks very much. Good morning. My name is Eric Li  and I was born here. But no  I wasn't born there. This was where I was born  Shanghai  at the height of the Cultural Revolution. My grandmother tells me that she heard the sound of gunfire along with my first cries. When I was growing up  I was told a story that explained all I ever needed to know about humanity. It went like this. All human societies develop in linear progression  beginning with primitive society  then slave society  feudalism  capitalism  socialism  and finally  guess where we end up  Communism  Sooner or later  all of humanity  regardless of culture  language  nationality  will arrive at this final stage of political and social development. The entire world's peoples will be unified in this paradise on Earth and live happily ever after. But before we get there  we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil  the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism  and the good shall triumph. That  of course  was the meta narrative distilled from the theories of Karl Marx. And the Chinese bought it. We were taught that grand story day in and day out. It became part of us  and we believed in it. The story was a bestseller. About one third of the entire world's population lived under that meta narrative. Then  the world changed overnight. As for me  disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth  I went to America and became a Berkeley hippie. Now  as I was coming of age  something else happened. As if one big story wasn't enough  I was told another one. This one was just as grand. It also claims that all human societies develop in a linear progression towards a singular end. This one went as follows  All societies  regardless of culture  be it Christian  Muslim  Confucian  must progress from traditional societies in which groups are the basic units to modern societies in which atomized individuals are the sovereign units  and all these individuals are  by definition  rational  and they all want one thing  the vote. Because they are all rational  once given the vote  they produce good government and live happily ever after. Paradise on Earth  again. Sooner or later  electoral democracy will be the only political system for all countries and all peoples  with a free market to make them all rich. But before we get there  we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil. The good belongs to those who are democracies and are charged with a mission of spreading it around the globe  sometimes by force  against the evil of those who do not hold elections. who would hold power. Eric X. Li  Now    This story also became a bestseller. According to Freedom House  the number of democracies went from    in      to     in     . In the last    years  Western elites tirelessly trotted around the globe selling this prospectus  Multiple parties fight for political power and everyone voting on them is the only path to salvation to the long suffering developing world. Those who buy the prospectus are destined for success. Those who do not are doomed to fail. But this time  the Chinese didn't buy it. Fool me once... The rest is history. In just    years  China went from one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world to its second largest economy. Six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty. Eighty percent of the entire world's poverty alleviation during that period happened in China. In other words  all the new and old democracies put together amounted to a mere fraction of what a single  one party state did without voting. See  I grew up on this stuff  food stamps. Meat was rationed to a few hundred grams per person per month at one point. Needless to say  I ate all my grandmother's portions. So I asked myself  what's wrong with this picture  Here I am in my hometown  my business growing leaps and bounds. Entrepreneurs are starting companies every day. Middle class is expanding in speed and scale unprecedented in human history. Yet  according to the grand story  none of this should be happening. So I went and did the only thing I could. I studied it. Yes  China is a one party state run by the Chinese Communist Party  the Party  and they don't hold elections. Three assumptions are made by the dominant political theories of our time. Such a system is operationally rigid  politically closed  and morally illegitimate. Well  the assumptions are wrong. The opposites are true. Adaptability  meritocracy  and legitimacy are the three defining characteristics of China's one party system. Now  most political scientists will tell us that a one party system is inherently incapable of self correction. It won't last long because it cannot adapt. Now here are the facts. In    years of running the largest country in the world  the range of the Party's policies has been wider than any other country in recent memory  from radical land collectivization to the Great Leap Forward  then privatization of farmland  then the Cultural Revolution  then Deng Xiaoping's market reform  then successor Jiang Zemin took the giant political step of opening up Party membership to private businesspeople  something unimaginable during Mao's rule. So the Party self corrects in rather dramatic fashions. Institutionally  new rules get enacted to correct previous dysfunctions. For example  term limits. Political leaders used to retain their positions for life  and they used that to accumulate power and perpetuate their rules. Mao was the father of modern China  yet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes. So the Party instituted term limits with mandatory retirement age of    to   . One thing we often hear is   Political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms   and  China is in dire need of political reform.  But this claim is a rhetorical trap hidden behind a political bias. See  some have decided a priori what kinds of changes they want to see  and only such changes can be called political reform. The truth is  political reforms have never stopped. Compared with    years ago     years  even    years ago  every aspect of Chinese society  how the country is governed  from the most local level to the highest center  are unrecognizable today. Now such changes are simply not possible without political reforms of the most fundamental kind. Now I would venture to suggest the Party is the world's leading expert in political reform. The second assumption is that in a one party state  power gets concentrated in the hands of the few  and bad governance and corruption follow. Indeed  corruption is a big problem  but let's first look at the larger context. Now  this may be counterintuitive to you. The Party happens to be one of the most meritocratic political institutions in the world today. China's highest ruling body  the Politburo  has    members. In the most recent one  only five of them came from a background of privilege  so called princelings. The other     including the president and the premier  came from entirely ordinary backgrounds. In the larger central committee of     or more  the percentage of those who were born into power and wealth was even smaller. The vast majority of senior Chinese leaders worked and competed their way to the top. Compare that with the ruling elites in both developed and developing countries  I think you'll find the Party being near the top in upward mobility. The question then is  how could that be possible in a system run by one party  Now we come to a powerful political institution  little known to Westerners  the Party's Organization Department. The department functions like a giant human resource engine that would be the envy of even some of the most successful corporations. It operates a rotating pyramid made up of three components  civil service  state owned enterprises  and social organizations like a university or a community program. They form separate yet integrated career paths for Chinese officials. They recruit college grads into entry level positions in all three tracks  and they start from the bottom  called  keyuan   clerk . Then they could get promoted through four increasingly elite ranks  fuke  deputy section manager   ke  section manager   fuchu  deputy division manager   and chu  division manger . Now these are not moves from  Karate Kid   okay  It's serious business. The range of positions is wide  from running health care in a village to foreign investment in a city district to manager in a company. Once a year  the department reviews their performance. They interview their superiors  their peers  their subordinates. They vet their personal conduct. They conduct public opinion surveys. Then they promote the winners. Throughout their careers  these cadres can move through and out of all three tracks. Over time  the good ones move beyond the four base levels to the fuju  deputy bureau chief  and ju  bureau chief  levels. There  they enter high officialdom. By that point  a typical assignment will be to manage a district with a population in the millions or a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Just to show you how competitive the system is  in       there were         fuke and ke levels          fuchu and chu levels  and only        fuju and ju levels. After the ju levels  the best few move further up several more ranks  and eventually make it to the Central Committee. The process takes two to three decades. Does patronage play a role  Yes  of course. But merit remains the fundamental driver. In essence  the Organization Department runs a modernized version of China's centuries old mentoring system. China's new president  Xi Jinping  is the son of a former leader  which is very unusual  first of his kind to make the top job. Even for him  the career took    years. He started as a village manager  and by the time he entered the Politburo  he had managed areas with a total population of     million people and combined GDPs of  .  trillion U.S. dollars. Now  please don't get me wrong  okay  This is not a put down of anyone. It's just a statement of fact. George W. Bush  remember him  This is not a put down. Before becoming governor of Texas  or Barack Obama before running for president  could not make even a small county manager in China's system. Winston Churchill once said that democracy is a terrible system except for all the rest. Well  apparently he hadn't heard of the Organization Department. Now  Westerners always assume that multi party election with universal suffrage is the only source of political legitimacy. I was asked once   The Party wasn't voted in by election. Where is the source of legitimacy   I said   How about competency   We all know the facts. In       when the Party took power  China was mired in civil wars  dismembered by foreign aggression  average life expectancy at that time     years old. Today  it's the second largest economy in the world  an industrial powerhouse  and its people live in increasing prosperity. Pew Research polls Chinese public attitudes  and here are the numbers in recent years. Satisfaction with the direction of the country     percent. Those who think they're better off than five years ago     percent. Those who expect the future to be better  a whopping    percent. Financial Times polls global youth attitudes  and these numbers  brand new  just came from last week. Ninety three percent of China's Generation Y are optimistic about their country's future. Now  if this is not legitimacy  I'm not sure what is. In contrast  most electoral democracies around the world are suffering from dismal performance. I don't need to elaborate for this audience how dysfunctional it is  from Washington to European capitals. With a few exceptions  the vast number of developing countries that have adopted electoral regimes are still suffering from poverty and civil strife. Governments get elected  and then they fall below    percent approval in a few months and stay there and get worse until the next election. Democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle of elect and regret. At this rate  I'm afraid it is democracy  not China's one party system  that is in danger of losing legitimacy. Now  I don't want to create the misimpression that China's hunky dory  on the way to some kind of superpowerdom. The country faces enormous challenges. The social and economic problems that come with wrenching change like this are mind boggling. Pollution is one. Food safety. Population issues. On the political front  the worst problem is corruption. Corruption is widespread and undermines the system and its moral legitimacy. But most analysts misdiagnose the disease. They say that corruption is the result of the one party system  and therefore  in order to cure it  you have to do away with the entire system. But a more careful look would tell us otherwise. Transparency International ranks China between    and    in recent years among     countries  and it's been moving up. India  the largest democracy in the world     and dropping. For the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China  more than half of them are electoral democracies. So if election is the panacea for corruption  how come these countries can't fix it  Now  I'm a venture capitalist. I make bets. It wouldn't be fair to end this talk without putting myself on the line and making some predictions. So here they are. In the next    years  China will surpass the U.S. and become the largest economy in the world. Income per capita will be near the top of all developing countries. Corruption will be curbed  but not eliminated  and China will move up    to    notches to above    in T.I. ranking. Economic reform will accelerate  political reform will continue  and the one party system will hold firm. We live in the dusk of an era. Meta narratives that make universal claims failed us in the   th century and are failing us in the   st. Meta narrative is the cancer that is killing democracy from the inside. Now  I want to clarify something. I'm not here to make an indictment of democracy. On the contrary  I think democracy contributed to the rise of the West and the creation of the modern world. It is the universal claim that many Western elites are making about their political system  the hubris  that is at the heart of the West's current ills. If they would spend just a little less time on trying to force their way onto others  and a little bit more on political reform at home  they might give their democracy a better chance. China's political model will never supplant electoral democracy  because unlike the latter  it doesn't pretend to be universal. It cannot be exported. But that is the point precisely. The significance of China's example is not that it provides an alternative  but the demonstration that alternatives exist. Let us draw to a close this era of meta narratives. Communism and democracy may both be laudable ideals  but the era of their dogmatic universalism is over. Let us stop telling people and our children there's only one way to govern ourselves and a singular future towards which all societies must evolve. It is wrong. It is irresponsible. And worst of all  it is boring. Let universality make way for plurality. Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us. Are we brave enough to welcome it  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Bruno Giussani  Eric  stay with me for a couple of minutes  because I want to ask you a couple of questions. I think many here  and in general in Western countries  would agree with your statement about analysis of democratic systems becoming dysfunctional  but at the same time  many would kind of find unsettling the thought that there is an unelected authority that  without any form of oversight or consultation  decides what the national interest is. What is the mechanism in the Chinese model that allows people to say  actually  the national interest as you defined it is wrong  EXL  You know  Frank Fukuyama  the political scientist  called the Chinese system  responsive authoritarianism.  It's not exactly right  but I think it comes close. So I know the largest public opinion survey company in China  okay  Do you know who their biggest client is  The Chinese government. Not just from the central government  the city government  the provincial government  to the most local neighborhood districts. They conduct surveys all the time. Are you happy with the garbage collection  Are you happy with the general direction of the country  So there is  in China  there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people. My point is  I think we should get unstuck from the thinking that there's only one political system    election  election  election    that could make it responsive. I'm not sure  actually  elections produce responsive government anymore in the world. BG  Many seem to agree. One of the features of a democratic system is a space for civil society to express itself. And you have shown figures about the support that the government and the authorities have in China. But then you've just mentioned other elements like  you know  big challenges  and there are  of course  a lot of other data that go in a different direction  tens of thousands of unrests and protests and environmental protests  etc. So you seem to suggest the Chinese model doesn't have a space outside of the Party for civil society to express itself. EXL  There's a vibrant civil society in China  whether it's environment or what have you. But it's different. You wouldn't recognize it. Because  by Western definitions  a so called civil society has to be separate or even in opposition to the political system  but that concept is alien for Chinese culture. For thousands of years  you have civil society  yet they are consistent and coherent and part of a political order  and I think it's a big cultural difference. BG  Eric  thank you for sharing this with TED. EXL  Thank you. There's an old joke about a cop who's walking his beat in the middle of the night  and he comes across a guy under a street lamp who's looking at the ground and moving from side to side  and the cop asks him what he's doing. The guys says he's looking for his keys. So the cop takes his time and looks over and kind of makes a little matrix and looks for about two  three minutes. No keys. The cop says   Are you sure  Hey buddy  are you sure you lost your keys here   And the guy says   No  actually I lost them down at the other end of the street  but the light is better here.  There's a concept that people talk about nowadays called  big data.  And what they're talking about is all of the information that we're generating through our interaction with and over the Internet  everything from Facebook and Twitter to music downloads  movies  streaming  all this kind of stuff  the live streaming of TED. And the folks who work with big data  for them  they talk about that their biggest problem is we have so much information. The biggest problem is  how do we organize all that information  I can tell you that  working in global health  that is not our biggest problem. Because for us  even though the light is better on the Internet  the data that would help us solve the problems we're trying to solve is not actually present on the Internet. So we don't know  for example  how many people right now are being affected by disasters or by conflict situations. We don't know for  really  basically  any of the clinics in the developing world  which ones have medicines and which ones don't. We have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics. We don't know    and this is really amazing to me    we don't know how many children were born    or how many children there are    in Bolivia or Botswana or Bhutan. We don't know how many kids died last week in any of those countries. We don't know the needs of the elderly  the mentally ill. For all of these different critically important problems or critically important areas that we want to solve problems in  we basically know nothing at all. And part of the reason why we don't know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems is what you see here. This is about a       year old technology. Some of you may have used it before. It's kind of on its way out now  but we still use it for    percent of our stuff. This is a paper form. And what you're looking at is a paper form in the hand of a Ministry of Health nurse in Indonesia  who is tramping out across the countryside in Indonesia on  I'm sure  a very hot and humid day  and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months  knocking on the doors and saying   Excuse me  we'd like to ask you some questions. Do you have any children  Were your children vaccinated   Because the only way we can actually find out how many children were vaccinated in the country of Indonesia  what percentage were vaccinated  is actually not on the Internet  but by going out and knocking on doors  sometimes tens of thousands of doors. Sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this. You know  a census of Indonesia would probably take two years to accomplish. And the problem  of course  with all of this is that  with all those paper forms    and I'm telling you  we have paper forms for every possible thing  We have paper forms for vaccination surveys. We have paper forms to track people who come into clinics. We have paper forms to track drug supplies  blood supplies    all these different paper forms for many different topics  they all have a single  common endpoint  and the common endpoint looks something like this. And what we're looking at here is a truckful of data. This is the data from a single vaccination coverage survey in a single district in the country of Zambia from a few years ago  that I participated in. The only thing anyone was trying to find out is what percentage of Zambian children are vaccinated  and this is the data  collected on paper over weeks  from a single district  which is something like a county in the United States. You can imagine that  for the entire country of Zambia  answering just that single question ... looks something like this. Truck after truck after truck  filled with stack after stack after stack of data. And what makes it even worse is that's just the beginning. Because once you've collected all that data  of course  someone    some unfortunate person    is going to have to type that into a computer. When I was a graduate student  I actually was that unfortunate person sometimes. I can tell you  I often wasn't really paying attention. I probably made a lot of mistakes when I did it that no one ever discovered  so data quality goes down. But eventually that data  hopefully  gets typed into a computer  and someone can begin to analyze it  and once they have an analysis and a report  hopefully  then you can take the results of that data collection and use it to vaccinate children better. Because if there's anything worse in the field of global public health    I don't know what's worse than allowing children on this planet to die of vaccine preventable diseases    diseases for which the vaccine costs a dollar. And millions of children die of these diseases every year. And the fact is  millions is a gross estimate  because we don't really know how many kids die each year of this. What makes it even more frustrating is that the data entry part  the part that I used to do as a grad student  can take sometimes six months. Sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer  And sometimes  actually not infrequently  it actually never happens. Now try and wrap your head around that for a second. You just had teams of hundreds of people. They went out into the field to answer a particular question. You probably spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on fuel and photocopying and per diem. And then for some reason  momentum is lost or there's no money left  and all of that comes to nothing  because no one actually types it into the computer at all. The process just stops. Happens all the time. This is what we base our decisions on in global health  little data  old data  no data. So back in       I began to think about ways in which we could improve this process. Now         obviously  that was quite a long time ago. It kind of frightens me to think of how long ago that was. The top movie of the year was  Die Hard with a Vengeance.  As you can see  Bruce Willis had a lot more hair back then. I was working in the Centers for Disease Control and I had a lot more hair back then as well. But to me  the most significant thing that I saw in      was this. Hard for us to imagine  but in       this was the ultimate elite mobile device. It wasn't an iPhone. It wasn't a Galaxy phone. It was a PalmPilot. And when I saw the PalmPilot for the first time  I thought   Why can't we put the forms on these PalmPilots  And go out into the field just carrying one PalmPilot  which can hold the capacity of tens of thousands of paper forms  Why don't we try to do that  Because if we can do that  if we can actually just collect the data electronically  digitally  from the very beginning  we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of typing  of having somebody type that stuff into the computer. We can skip straight to the analysis and then straight to the use of the data to actually save lives.  So that's what I began to do. Working at CDC  I began to travel to different programs around the world and to train them in using PalmPilots to do data collection  instead of using paper. And it actually worked great. It worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted. What do you know  Digital data collection is actually more efficient than collecting on paper. While I was doing it  my business partner  Rose  who's here with her husband  Matthew  here in the audience  Rose was out doing similar stuff for the American Red Cross. The problem was  after a few years of doing that  I realized    I had been to maybe six or seven programs    and I thought  you know  if I keep this up at this pace  over my whole career  maybe I'm going to go to maybe    or    programs. But the problem is     or    programs  like  training    or    programs to use this technology  that is a tiny drop in the bucket. The demand for this  the need for data to run better programs just within health    not to mention all of the other fields in developing countries    is enormous. There are millions and millions and millions of programs  millions of clinics that need to track drugs  millions of vaccine programs. There are schools that need to track attendance. There are all these different things for us to get the data that we need to do. And I realized if I kept up the way that I was doing  I was basically hardly going to make any impact by the end of my career. And so I began to rack my brain  trying to think about  what was the process that I was doing  How was I training folks  and what were the bottlenecks and what were the obstacles to doing it faster and to doing it more efficiently  And  unfortunately  after thinking about this for some time  I identified the main obstacle. And the main obstacle  it turned out    and this is a sad realization    the main obstacle was me. So what do I mean by that  I had developed a process whereby I was the center of the universe of this technology. If you wanted to use this technology  you had to get in touch with me. That means you had to know I existed. Then you had to find the money to pay for me to fly out to your country and the money to pay for my hotel and my per diem and my daily rate. So you could be talking about     or     or        dollars  if I actually had the time or it fit my schedule and I wasn't on vacation. The point is that anything  any system that depends on a single human being or two or three or five human beings    it just doesn't scale. And this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology  and we need to scale it now. And so I began to think of ways in which I could basically take myself out of the picture. And  you know  I was thinking   How could I take myself out of the picture   for quite some time. I'd been trained that the way you distribute technology within international development is always consultant based. It's always guys that look pretty much like me  flying from countries that look pretty much like this to other countries with people with darker skin. And you go out there  and you spend money on airfare and you spend time and you spend per diem and you spend for a hotel and all that stuff. As far as I knew  that was the only way you could distribute technology  and I couldn't figure out a way around it. But the miracle that happened    I'm going to call it Hotmail for short. You may not think of Hotmail as being miraculous  but for me it was miraculous  because I noticed  just as I was wrestling with this problem    I was working in sub Saharan Africa  mostly  at the time    I noticed that every sub Saharan African health worker that I was working with had a Hotmail account. And it struck me   Wait a minute    I know the Hotmail people surely didn't fly to the Ministry of Health in Kenya to train people in how to use Hotmail. So these guys are distributing technology  getting software capacity out there  but they're not actually flying around the world. I need to think about this more.  While I was thinking about it  people started using even more things like this  just as we were. They started using LinkedIn and Flickr and Gmail and Google Maps    all these things. Of course  all of these things are cloud based and don't require any training. They don't require any programmers. They don't require consultants. Because the business model for all these businesses requires that something be so simple we can use it ourselves  with little or no training. You just have to hear about it and go to the website. And so I thought  what would happen if we built software to do what I'd been consulting in  Instead of training people how to put forms onto mobile devices  let's create software that lets them do it themselves with no training and without me being involved. And that's exactly what we did. So we created software called Magpi  which has an online form creator. No one has to speak to me  you just have to hear about it and go to the website. You can create forms  and once you've created the forms  you push them to a variety of common mobile phones. Obviously  nowadays  we've moved past PalmPilots to mobile phones. And it doesn't have to be a smartphone  it can be a basic phone  like the phone on the right  the basic Symbian phone that's very common in developing countries. And the great part about this is it's just like Hotmail. It's cloud based  and it doesn't require any training  programming  consultants. But there are some additional benefits as well. Now we knew when we built this system  the whole point of it  just like with the PalmPilots  was that you'd be able to collect the data and immediately upload the data and get your data set. But what we found  of course  since it's already on a computer  we can deliver instant maps and analysis and graphing. We can take a process that took two years and compress that down to the space of five minutes. Unbelievable improvements in efficiency. Cloud based  no training  no consultants  no me. And I told you that in the first few years of trying to do this the old fashioned way  going out to each country  we probably trained about       people. What happened after we did this  In the second three years  we had        people find the website  sign up and start using it to collect data  data for disaster response  Canadian pig farmers tracking pig disease and pig herds  people tracking drug supplies. One of my favorite examples  the IRC  International Rescue Committee  they have a program where semi literate midwives  using     mobile phones  send a text message using our software  once a week  with the number of births and the number of deaths  which gives IRC something that no one in global health has ever had  a near real time system of counting babies  of knowing how many kids are born  of knowing how many children there are in Sierra Leone  which is the country where this is happening  and knowing how many children die. Physicians for Human Rights    this is moving a little bit outside the health field    they're basically training people to do rape exams in Congo  where this is an epidemic  a horrible epidemic  and they're using our software to document the evidence they find  including photographically  so that they can bring the perpetrators to justice. Camfed  another charity based out of the UK    Camfed pays girls' families to keep them in school. They understand this is the most significant intervention they can make. They used to track the disbursements  the attendance  the grades  on paper. The turnaround time between a teacher writing down grades or attendance and getting that into a report was about two to three years. Now it's real time. And because this is such a low cost system and based in the cloud  it costs  for the entire five countries that Camfed runs this in  with tens of thousands of girls  the whole cost combined is        dollars a year. That's less than I used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation. So I told you before that when we were doing it the old fashioned way  I realized all of our work was really adding up to just a drop in the bucket               different programs. We've made a lot of progress  but I recognize that right now  even the work that we've done with        people using this is still a drop in the bucket. But something's changed  and I think it should be obvious. What's changed now is  instead of having a program in which we're scaling at such a slow rate that we can never reach all the people who need us  we've made it unnecessary for people to get reached by us. We've created a tool that lets programs keep kids in school  track the number of babies that are born and the number of babies that die  catch criminals and successfully prosecute them    to do all these different things to learn more about what's going on  to understand more  to see more ... and to save lives and improve lives. Thank you. Throughout the history of computers we've been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information  the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild. And this gap has become shorter  shorter  and even shorter  and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter  the thickness of a touch screen glass  and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone. But I wondered  what if there could be no boundary at all  I started to imagine what this would look like. First  I created this tool which penetrates into the digital space  so when you press it hard on the screen  it transfers its physical body into pixels. Designers can materialize their ideas directly in  D  and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen. So with this tool  this boundary has been broken. But our two hands still remain outside the screen. How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands  At Microsoft Applied Sciences  along with my mentor Cati Boulanger  I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace. By combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face  now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this  D space and grab pixels with your bare hands. Because windows and files have a position in the real space  selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf. Then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines  words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window. Architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly. So in these examples  we are reaching into the digital world. But how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead  I'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online. But now you don't have to worry about it. What I got here is an online augmented fitting room. This is a view that you get from head mounted or see through display when the system understands the geometry of your body. Taking this idea further  I started to think  instead of just seeing these pixels in our space  how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it  What would such a future look like  At MIT Media Lab  along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Rehmi Post  we created this one physical pixel. Well  in this case  this spherical magnet acts like a  D pixel in our space  which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little  D space. What we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies. And by digitally programming the object  we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space  which means that now  human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world. So choreography can be taught physically over distance and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality. Students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion  physics  and unlike computer screens or textbooks  this is a real  tangible experience that you can touch and feel  and it's very powerful. And what's more exciting than just turning what's currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities. As you can see  the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world. Today  we started by talking about the boundary  but if we remove this boundary  the only boundary left is our imagination. Thank you. When we talk about corruption  there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind. There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs. Saparmurat Niyazov  he was one of them. Until his death in       he was the all powerful leader of Turkmenistan  a Central Asian country rich in natural gas. Now  he really loved to issue presidential decrees. And one renamed the months of the year including after himself and his mother. He spent millions of dollars creating a bizarre personality cult  and his crowning glory was the building of a    foot high gold plated statue of himself which stood proudly in the capital's central square and rotated to follow the sun. He was a slightly unusual guy. And then there's that clich   the African dictator or minister or official. There's Teodor n Obiang. So his daddy is president for life of Equatorial Guinea  a West African nation that has exported billions of dollars of oil since the     s and yet has a truly appalling human rights record. The vast majority of its people are living in really miserable poverty despite an income per capita that's on a par with that of Portugal. So Obiang junior  well  he buys himself a     million mansion in Malibu  California. I've been up to its front gates. I can tell you it's a magnificent spread. He bought an     million art collection that used to belong to fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent  a stack of fabulous sports cars  some costing a million dollars apiece    oh  and a Gulfstream jet  too. Now get this  Until recently  he was earning an official monthly salary of less than       dollars. And there's Dan Etete. Well  he was the former oil minister of Nigeria under President Abacha  and it just so happens he's a convicted money launderer too. We've spent a great deal of time investigating a    billion    that's right  a    billion   oil deal that he was involved with  and what we found was pretty shocking  but more about that later. So it's easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there  carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries that we  personally  may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected by what might be going on. But does it just happen over there  Well  at     I was very lucky. My first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African ivory. And that's how my relationship with corruption really began. In       with two friends who were colleagues  Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley  we set up an organization called Global Witness. Our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in Cambodia. So a few years later  and it's now       and I'm in Angola undercover investigating blood diamonds. Perhaps you saw the film  the Hollywood film  Blood Diamond   the one with Leonardo DiCaprio. Well  some of that sprang from our work. Luanda  it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the streets  and a tiny  very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to Brazil and Portugal. And it was a slightly crazy place. So I'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room feeling just totally overwhelmed. But it wasn't about blood diamonds. Because I'd been speaking to lots of people there who  well  they talked about a different problem  that of a massive web of corruption on a global scale and millions of oil dollars going missing. And for what was then a very small organization of just a few people  trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge. And in the years that I've been  and we've all been campaigning and investigating  I've repeatedly seen that what makes corruption on a global  massive scale possible  well it isn't just greed or the misuse of power or that nebulous phrase  weak governance.  I mean  yes  it's all of those  but corruption  it's made possible by the actions of global facilitators. So let's go back to some of those people I talked about earlier. Now  they're all people we've investigated  and they're all people who couldn't do what they do alone. Take Obiang junior. Well  he didn't end up with high end art and luxury houses without help. He did business with global banks. A bank in Paris held accounts of companies controlled by him  one of which was used to buy the art  and American banks  well  they funneled    million dollars into the States  some of which was used to buy that California mansion. And he didn't do all of this in his own name either. He used shell companies. He used one to buy the property  and another  which was in somebody else's name  to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place. And then there's Dan Etete. Well  when he was oil minister  he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars to a company that  guess what  yeah  he was the hidden owner of. Now  it was then much later traded on with the kind assistance of the Nigerian government    now I have to be careful what I say here   to subsidiaries of Shell and the Italian Eni  two of the biggest oil companies around. So the reality is  is that the engine of corruption  well  it exists far beyond the shores of countries like Equatorial Guinea or Nigeria or Turkmenistan. This engine  well  it's driven by our international banking system  by the problem of anonymous shell companies  and by the secrecy that we have afforded big oil  gas and mining operations  and  most of all  by the failure of our politicians to back up their rhetoric and do something really meaningful and systemic to tackle this stuff. Now let's take the banks first. Well  it's not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money  but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too. For example  in Sarawak  Malaysia. Now this region  it has just five percent of its forests left intact. Five percent. So how did that happen  Well  because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years. So we sent an undercover investigator in to secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite  and the resulting footage  well  it made some people very angry  and you can see that on YouTube  but it proved what we had long suspected  because it showed how the state's chief minister  despite his later denials  used his control over land and forest licenses to enrich himself and his family. And HSBC  well  we know that HSBC bankrolled the region's largest logging companies that were responsible for some of that destruction in Sarawak and elsewhere. The bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process  but it earned around     million dollars. Now shortly after our expos   very shortly after our expos  earlier this year  the bank announced a policy review on this. And is this progress  Maybe  but we're going to be keeping a very close eye on that case. And then there's the problem of anonymous shell companies. Well  we've all heard about what they are  I think  and we all know they're used quite a bit by people and companies who are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society  also known as taxes. But what doesn't usually come to light is how shell companies are used to steal huge sums of money  transformational sums of money  from poor countries. In virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated  shell companies have appeared  and sometimes it's been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal. A recent study by the World Bank looked at     cases of corruption. It found that over    percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies  totaling almost    billion dollars. Now many of these companies were in America or the United Kingdom  its overseas territories and Crown dependencies  and so it's not just an offshore problem  it's an on shore one too. You see  shell companies  they're central to the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites rather than ordinary citizens. One striking recent case that we've investigated is how the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo sold off a series of valuable  state owned mining assets to shell companies in the British Virgin Islands. So we spoke to sources in country  trawled through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal. And we were alarmed to find that these shell companies had quickly flipped many of the assets on for huge profits to major international mining companies listed in London. Now  the Africa Progress Panel  led by Kofi Annan  they've calculated that Congo may have lost more than  .  billion dollars from these deals. That's almost twice the country's annual health and education budget combined. And will the people of Congo  will they ever get their money back  Well  the answer to that question  and who was really involved and what really happened  well that's going to probably remain locked away in the secretive company registries of the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere unless we all do something about it. And how about the oil  gas and mining companies  Okay  maybe it's a bit of a clich  to talk about them. Corruption in that sector  no surprise. There's corruption everywhere  so why focus on that sector  Well  because there's a lot at stake. In       natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost    to one in Africa  Asia and Latin America. Nineteen to one. Now that's a hell of a lot of schools and universities and hospitals and business startups  many of which haven't materialized and never will because some of that money has simply been stolen away. Now let's go back to the oil and mining companies  and let's go back to Dan Etete and that    billion deal. And now forgive me  I'm going to read the next bit because it's a very live issue  and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right. Now  on the surface  the deal appeared straightforward. Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni paid the Nigerian government for the block. The Nigerian government transferred precisely the same amount  to the very dollar  to an account earmarked for a shell company whose hidden owner was Etete. Now  that's not bad going for a convicted money launderer. And here's the thing. After many months of digging around and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents  we found evidence that  in fact  Shell and Eni had known that the funds would be transferred to that shell company  and frankly  it's hard to believe they didn't know who they were really dealing with there. Now  it just shouldn't take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went. I mean  these are state assets. They're supposed to be used for the benefit of the people in the country. But in some countries  citizens and journalists who are trying to expose stories like this have been harassed and arrested and some have even risked their lives to do so. And finally  well  there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable. It's just how some business is done. It's too complex and difficult to change. So in effect  what  We just accept it. But as a campaigner and investigator  I have a different view  because I've seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum. In the oil and mining sector  for example  there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems. In       when Global Witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent  well  some people laughed at the extreme naivet  of that small idea. But literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency  and now it's fast becoming the norm and the law. Two thirds of the value of the world's oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws. Two thirds. So this is change happening. This is progress. But we're not there yet  by far. Because it really isn't about corruption somewhere over there  is it  In a globalized world  corruption is a truly globalized business  and one that needs global solutions  supported and pushed by us all  as global citizens  right here. Thank you. This is my grandfather. And this is my son. My grandfather taught me to work with wood when I was a little boy  and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something  honor that tree's life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can. My little boy reminded me that for all the technology and all the toys in the world  sometimes just a small block of wood  if you stack it up tall  actually is an incredibly inspiring thing. These are my buildings. I build all around the world out of our office in Vancouver and New York. And we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials  depending on where we are. But wood is the material that I love the most  and I'm going to tell you the story about wood. And part of the reason I love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood  I notice they react completely differently. I've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings and hug a steel or a concrete column  but I've actually seen that happen in a wood building. I've actually seen how people touch the wood  and I think there's a reason for it. Just like snowflakes  no two pieces of wood can ever be the same anywhere on Earth. That's a wonderful thing. I like to think that wood gives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings. It's Mother Nature's fingerprints that make our buildings connect us to nature in the built environment. Now  I live in Vancouver  near a forest that grows to    stories tall. Down the coast here in California  the redwood forest grows to    stories tall. But the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on Earth. Even building codes actually limit the ability for us to build much taller than four stories in many places  and that's true here in the United States. Now there are exceptions  but there needs to be some exceptions  and things are going to change  I'm hoping. And the reason I think that way is that today half of us live in cities  and that number is going to grow to    percent. Cities and density mean that our buildings are going to continue to be big  and I think there's a role for wood to play in cities. And I feel that way because three billion people in the world today  over the next    years  will need a new home. That's    percent of the world that are going to need a new building built for them in the next    years. Now  one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum. That's one billion people in the world live in slums. A hundred million people in the world are homeless. The scale of the challenge for architects and for society to deal with in building is to find a solution to house these people. But the challenge is  as we move to cities  cities are built in these two materials  steel and concrete  and they're great materials. They're the materials of the last century. But they're also materials with very high energy and very high greenhouse gas emissions in their process. Steel represents about three percent of man's greenhouse gas emissions  and concrete is over five percent. So if you think about that  eight percent of our contribution to greenhouse gases today comes from those two materials alone. We don't think about it a lot  and unfortunately  we actually don't even think about buildings  I think  as much as we should. This is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases. Almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry  and if we look at energy  it's the same story. You'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list  but that's the conversation we mostly hear about. And although a lot of that is about energy  it's also so much about carbon. The problem I see is that  ultimately  the clash of how we solve that problem of serving those three billion people that need a home  and climate change  are a head on collision about to happen  or already happening. That challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways  and I think wood is going to be part of that solution  and I'm going to tell you the story of why. As an architect  wood is the only material  big material  that I can build with that's already grown by the power of the sun. When a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide  and it dies and it falls to the forest floor  it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground. If it burns in a forest fire  it's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well. But if you take that wood and you put it into a building or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy  it actually has an amazing capacity to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration. One cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide. Now our two solutions to climate are obviously to reduce our emissions and find storage. Wood is the only major material building material I can build with that actually does both those two things. So I believe that we have an ethic that the Earth grows our food  and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the Earth should grow our homes. Now  how are we going to do that when we're urbanizing at this rate and we think about wood buildings only at four stories  We need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger  and what we've been working on is    story tall buildings made of wood. We've been engineering them with an engineer named Eric Karsh who works with me on it  and we've been doing this new work because there are new wood products out there for us to use  and we call them mass timber panels. These are panels made with young trees  small growth trees  small pieces of wood glued together to make panels that are enormous  eight feet wide     feet long  and of various thicknesses. The way I describe this best  I've found  is to say that we're all used to two by four construction when we think about wood. That's what people jump to as a conclusion. Two by four construction is sort of like the little eight dot bricks of Lego that we all played with as kids  and you can make all kinds of cool things out of Lego at that size  and out of two by fours. But do remember when you were a kid  and you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement  and you found that big    dot brick of Lego  and you were kind of like   Cool  this is awesome. I can build something really big  and this is going to be great.  That's the change. Mass timber panels are those    dot bricks. They're changing the scale of what we can do  and what we've developed is something we call FFTT  which is a Creative Commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to. This animation shows you how the building goes together in a very simple way  but these buildings are available for architects and engineers now to build on for different cultures in the world  different architectural styles and characters. In order for us to build safely  we've engineered these buildings  actually  to work in a Vancouver context  where we're a high seismic zone  even at    stories tall. Now obviously  every time I bring this up  people even  you know  here at the conference  say   Are you serious  Thirty stories  How's that going to happen   And there's a lot of really good questions that are asked and important questions that we spent quite a long time working on the answers to as we put together our report and the peer reviewed report. I'm just going to focus on a few of them  and let's start with fire  because I think fire is probably the first one that you're all thinking about right now. Fair enough. And the way I describe it is this. If I asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire  it doesn't happen  right  We all know that. But to build a fire  you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up  and eventually you can add the log to the fire  and when you do add the log to the fire  of course  it burns  but it burns slowly. Well  mass timber panels  these new products that we're using  are much like the log. It's hard to start them on fire  and when they do  they actually burn extraordinarily predictably  and we can use fire science in order to predict and make these buildings as safe as concrete and as safe as steel. The next big issue  deforestation. Eighteen percent of our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide is the result of deforestation. The last thing we want to do is cut down trees. Or  the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees. There are models for sustainable forestry that allow us to cut trees properly  and those are the only trees appropriate to use for these kinds of systems. Now I actually think that these ideas will change the economics of deforestation. In countries with deforestation issues  we need to find a way to provide better value for the forest and actually encourage people to make money through very fast growth cycles                 year old trees that make these products and allow us to build at this scale. We've calculated a    story building  We'll grow enough wood in North America every    minutes. That's how much it takes. The carbon story here is a really good one. If we built a    story building out of cement and concrete  the process would result in the manufacturing of that cement and       tonnes of carbon dioxide. If we did it in wood  in this solution  we'd sequester about       tonnes  for a net difference of       tonnes. That's the equivalent of about     cars removed from the road in one year. Think back to that three billion people that need a new home  and maybe this is a contributor to reducing. We're at the beginning of a revolution  I hope  in the way we build  because this is the first new way to build a skyscraper in probably     years or more. But the challenge is changing society's perception of possibility  and it's a huge challenge. The engineering is  truthfully  the easy part of this. And the way I describe it is this. The first skyscraper  technically    and the definition of a skyscraper is    stories tall  believe it or not   but the first skyscraper was this one in Chicago  and people were terrified to walk underneath this building. But only four years after it was built  Gustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower  and as he built the Eiffel Tower  he changed the skylines of the cities of the world  changed and created a competition between places like New York City and Chicago  where developers started building bigger and bigger buildings and pushing the envelope up higher and higher with better and better engineering. We built this model in New York  actually  as a theoretical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come  and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like  because the exterior can change. It's really just the structure that we're talking about. The reason we picked it is because this is a technical university  and I believe that wood is the most technologically advanced material I can build with. It just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent  and we don't really feel comfortable with it. But that's the way it should be  nature's fingerprints in the built environment. I'm looking for this opportunity to create an Eiffel Tower moment  we call it. Buildings are starting to go up around the world. There's a building in London that's nine stories  a new building that just finished in Australia that I believe is    or   . We're starting to push the height up of these wood buildings  and we're hoping  and I'm hoping  that my hometown of Vancouver actually potentially announces the world's tallest at around    stories in the not so distant future. That Eiffel Tower moment will break the ceiling  these arbitrary ceilings of height  and allow wood buildings to join the competition. And I believe the race is ultimately on. Thank you. Diana Reiss  You may think you're looking through a window at a dolphin spinning playfully  but what you're actually looking through is a two way mirror at a dolphin looking at itself spinning playfully. This is a dolphin that is self aware. This dolphin has self awareness. It's a young dolphin named Bayley. I've been very interested in understanding the nature of the intelligence of dolphins for the past    years. How do we explore intelligence in this animal that's so different from us  And what I've used is a very simple research tool  a mirror  and we've gained great information  reflections of these animal minds. Dolphins aren't the only animals  the only non human animals  to show mirror self recognition. We used to think this was a uniquely human ability  but we learned that the great apes  our closest relatives  also show this ability. Then we showed it in dolphins  and then later in elephants. We did this work in my lab with the dolphins and elephants  and it's been recently shown in the magpie. Now  it's interesting  because we've embraced this Darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution  this physical continuity. But we've been much more reticent  much slower at recognizing this continuity in cognition  in emotion  in consciousness in other animals. Other animals are conscious. They're emotional. They're aware. There have been multitudes of studies with many species over the years that have given us exquisite evidence for thinking and consciousness in other animals  other animals that are quite different than we are in form. We are not alone. We are not alone in these abilities. And I hope  and one of my biggest dreams  is that  with our growing awareness about the consciousness of others and our relationship with the rest of the animal world  that we'll give them the respect and protection that they deserve. So that's a wish I'm throwing out here for everybody  and I hope I can really engage you in this idea. Now  I want to return to dolphins  because these are the animals that I feel like I've been working up closely and personal with for over    years. And these are real personalities. They are not persons  but they're personalities in every sense of the word. And you can't get more alien than the dolphin. They are very different from us in body form. They're radically different. They come from a radically different environment. In fact  we're separated by    million years of divergent evolution. Look at this body. And in every sense of making a pun here  these are true non terrestrials. I wondered how we might interface with these animals. In the     s  I developed an underwater keyboard. This was a custom made touch screen keyboard. What I wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control. These are big brains  highly social animals  and I thought  well  if we give them choice and control  if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard    and by the way  it was interfaced by fiber optic cables from Hewlett Packard with an Apple II computer. This seems prehistoric now  but this was where we were with technology. So the dolphins could hit a key  a symbol  they heard a computer generated whistle  and they got an object or activity. Now here's a little video. This is Delphi and Pan  and you're going to see Delphi hitting a key  he hears a computer generated whistle     Whistle     and gets a ball  so they can actually ask for things they want. What was remarkable is  they explored this keyboard on their own. There was no intervention on our part. They explored the keyboard. They played around with it. They figured out how it worked. And they started to quickly imitate the sounds they were hearing on the keyboard. They imitated on their own. Beyond that  though  they started learning associations between the symbols  the sounds and the objects. What we saw was self organized learning  and now I'm imagining  what can we do with new technologies  How can we create interfaces  new windows into the minds of animals  with the technologies that exist today  So I was thinking about this  and then  one day  I got a call from Peter. Peter Gabriel  I make noises for a living. On a good day  it's music  and I want to talk a little bit about the most amazing music making experience I ever had. I'm a farm boy. I grew up surrounded by animals  and I would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there  So as an adult  when I started to read about the amazing breakthroughs with Penny Patterson and Koko  with Sue Savage Rumbaugh and Kanzi  Panbanisha  Irene Pepperberg  Alex the parrot  I got all excited. What was amazing to me also was they seemed a lot more adept at getting a handle on our language than we were on getting a handle on theirs. I work with a lot of musicians from around the world  and often we don't have any common language at all  but we sit down behind our instruments  and suddenly there's a way for us to connect and emote. So I started cold calling  and eventually got through to Sue Savage Rumbaugh  and she invited me down. I went down  and the bonobos had had access to percussion instruments  musical toys  but never before to a keyboard. At first they did what infants do  just bashed it with their fists  and then I asked  through Sue  if Panbanisha could try with one finger only. Sue Savage Rumbaugh  Can you play a grooming song  I want to hear a grooming song. Play a real quiet grooming song. PG  So groom was the subject of the piece. So I'm just behind  jamming  yeah  this is what we started with. Sue's encouraging her to continue a little more. She discovers a note she likes  finds the octave. She'd never sat at a keyboard before. Nice triplets. SSR  You did good. That was very good. PG  She hit good. So that night  we began to dream  and we thought  perhaps the most amazing tool that man's created is the Internet  and what would happen if we could somehow find new interfaces  visual audio interfaces that would allow these remarkable sentient beings that we share the planet with access  And Sue Savage Rumbaugh got excited about that  called her friend Steve Woodruff  and we began hustling all sorts of people whose work related or was inspiring  which led us to Diana  and led us to Neil. Neil Gershenfeld  Thanks  Peter. PG  Thank you. NG  So Peter approached me. I lost it when I saw that clip. He approached me with a vision of doing these things not for people  for animals. And then I was struck in the history of the Internet. This is what the Internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the Internet of middle aged white men  mostly middle aged white men. Vint Cerf   Laughs  NG  Speaking as one. Then  when I first came to TED  which was where I met Peter  I showed this. This is a    web server  and at the time that was radical. And the possibility of making a web server for a dollar grew into what became known as the Internet of Things  which is literally an industry now with tremendous implications for health care  energy efficiency. And we were happy with ourselves. And then when Peter showed me that  I realized we had missed something  which is the rest of the planet. So we started up this interspecies Internet project. Now we started talking with TED about how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants to TED  and we realized that wouldn't work. So we're going to bring you to them. So if we could switch to the audio from this computer  we've been video conferencing with cognitive animals  and we're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them. And so if we could also have this up  great. So the first site we're going to meet is Cameron Park Zoo in Waco  with orangutans. In the daytime they live outside. It's nighttime there now. So can you please go ahead  Terri Cox  Hi  I'm Terri Cox with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco  Texas  and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei  two of our Bornean orangutans. During the day  they have a beautiful  large outdoor habitat  and at night  they come into this habitat  into their night quarters  where they can have a climate controlled and secure environment to sleep in. We participate in the Apps for Apes program Orangutan Outreach  and we use iPads to help stimulate and enrich the animals  and also help raise awareness for these critically endangered animals. And they share    percent of our DNA and are incredibly intelligent  so it's so exciting to think of all the opportunities that we have via technology and the Internet to really enrich their lives and open up their world. We're really excited about the possibility of an interspecies Internet  and K.J. has been enjoying the conference very much. NG  That's great. When we were rehearsing last night  he had fun watching the elephants. Next user group are the dolphins at the National Aquarium. Please go ahead. Allison Ginsburg  Good evening. Well  my name is Allison Ginsburg  and we're live in Baltimore at the National Aquarium. Joining me are three of our eight Atlantic bottlenose dolphins     year old Chesapeake  who was our first dolphin born here  her four year old daughter Bayley  and her half sister     year old Maya. Now  here at the National Aquarium we are committed to excellence in animal care  to research  and to conservation. The dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what's going on here tonight. They're not really used to having cameras here at   o'clock at night. In addition  we are very committed to doing different types of research. As Diana mentioned  our animals are involved in many different research studies. NG  Those are for you. Okay  that's great  thank you. And the third user group  in Thailand  is Think Elephants. Go ahead  Josh. Josh Plotnik  Hi  my name is Josh Plotnik  and I'm with Think Elephants International  and we're here in the Golden Triangle of Thailand with the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation elephants. And we have    elephants here  and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants  but our foundation Think Elephants is focused on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world virtually like this and showing people how incredible these animals are. So we're able to bring the camera right up to the elephant  put food into the elephant's mouth  show people what's going on inside their mouths  and show everyone around the world how incredible these animals really are. NG  Okay  that's great. Thanks Josh. And once again  we've been building great relationships among them just since we've been rehearsing. So at that point  if we can go back to the other computer  we were starting to think about how you integrate the rest of the biomass of the planet into the Internet  and we went to the best possible person I can think of  which is Vint Cerf  who is one of the founders who gave us the Internet. Vint  VC  Thank you  Neil. A long time ago in a galaxy   oops  wrong script. Forty years ago  Bob Kahn and I did the design of the Internet. Thirty years ago  we turned it on. Just last year  we turned on the production Internet. You've been using the experimental version for the last    years. The production version  it uses IP version  . It has  .  times    to the   th possible terminations. That's a number only that Congress can appreciate. But it leads to what is coming next. When Bob and I did this design  we thought we were building a system to connect computers together. What we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together. And what you've seen tonight tells you that we should not restrict this network to one species  that these other intelligent  sentient species should be part of the system too. This is the system as it looks today  by the way. This is what the Internet looks like to a computer that's trying to figure out where the traffic is supposed to go. This is generated by a program that's looking at the connectivity of the Internet  and how all the various networks are connected together. There are about         networks  interconnected  run independently by         different operating agencies  and the only reason this works is that they all use the same standard TCP IP protocols. Well  you know where this is headed. The Internet of Things tell us that a lot of computer enabled appliances and devices are going to become part of this system too  appliances that you use around the house  that you use in your office  that you carry around with yourself or in the car. That's the Internet of Things that's coming. Now  what's important about what these people are doing is that they're beginning to learn how to communicate with species that are not us but share a common sensory environment. We're beginning to explore what it means to communicate with something that isn't just another person. Well  you can see what's coming next. All kinds of possible sentient beings may be interconnected through this system  and I can't wait to see these experiments unfold. What happens after that  Well  let's see. There are machines that need to talk to machines and that we need to talk to  and so as time goes on  we're going to have to learn how to communicate with computers and how to get computers to communicate with us in the way that we're accustomed to  not with keyboards  not with mice  but with speech and gestures and all the natural human language that we're accustomed to. So we'll need something like C PO to become a translator between ourselves and some of the other machines we live with. Now  there is a project that's underway called the interplanetary Internet. It's in operation between Earth and Mars. It's operating on the International Space Station. It's part of the spacecraft that's in orbit around the Sun that's rendezvoused with two planets. So the interplanetary system is on its way  but there's a last project  which the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  which funded the original ARPANET  funded the Internet  funded the interplanetary architecture  is now funding a project to design a spacecraft to get to the nearest star in     years' time. What that means is that what we're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us  ultimately  how we might interact with an alien from another world. I can hardly wait. June Cohen  So first of all  thank you  and I would like to acknowledge that four people who could talk to us for full four days actually managed to stay to four minutes each  and we thank you for that. I have so many questions  but maybe a few practical things that the audience might want to know. You're launching this idea here at TED   PG  Today. JC  Today. This is the first time you're talking about it. Tell me a little bit about where you're going to take the idea. What's next  PG  I think we want to engage as many people here as possible in helping us think of smart interfaces that will make all this possible. NG  And just mechanically  there's a     c     and web infrastructure and all of that  but it's not quite ready to turn on  so we'll roll that out  and contact us if you want the information on it. The idea is this will be    much like the Internet functions as a network of networks  which is Vint's core contribution  this will be a wrapper around all of these initiatives  that are wonderful individually  to link them globally. JC  Right  and do you have a web address that we might look for yet  NG  Shortly. JC  Shortly. We will come back to you on that. And very quickly  just to clarify. Some people might have looked at the video that you showed and thought  well  that's just a webcam. What's special about it  If you could talk for just a moment about how you want to go past that  NG  So this is scalable video infrastructure  not for a few to a few but many to many  so that it scales to symmetrical video sharing and content sharing across these sites around the planet. So there's a lot of back end signal processing  not for one to many  but for many to many. JC  Right  and then on a practical level  which technologies are you looking at first  I know you mentioned that a keyboard is a really key part of this. DR  We're trying to develop an interactive touch screen for dolphins. This is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work  and we just got our first seed money today towards that  so it's our first project. JC  Before the talk  even. DR  Yeah. JC  Wow. Well done. All right  well thank you all so much for joining us. It's such a delight to have you on the stage. DR  Thank you. VC  Thank you. Have you ever experienced a moment in your life that was so painful and confusing  that all you wanted to do was learn as much as you could to make sense of it all  When I was     a close family friend who was like an uncle to me passed away from pancreatic cancer. When the disease hit so close to home  I knew I needed to learn more. So I went online to find answers. Using the Internet  I found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer  and what I had found shocked me. Over    percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late  when someone has less than a two percent chance of survival. Why are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer  The reason  Today's current  modern  medicine is a    year old technique. That's older than my dad. But also  it's extremely expensive  costing     dollars per test  and it's grossly inaccurate  missing    percent of all pancreatic cancers. Your doctor would have to be ridiculously suspicious that you have the cancer in order to give you this test. Learning this  I knew there had to be a better way. So  I set up scientific criteria as to what a sensor would have to look like in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer. The sensor would have to be  inexpensive  rapid  simple  sensitive  selective  and minimally invasive. Now  there's a reason why this test hasn't been updated in over six decades. And that's because when we're looking for pancreatic cancer  we're looking at your bloodstream  which is already abundant in all these tons and tons of protein  and you're looking for this miniscule difference in this tiny amount of protein. Just this one protein. That's next to impossible. However  undeterred due to my teenage optimism    I went online to a teenager's two best friends  Google and Wikipedia. I got everything for my homework from those two sources. And what I had found was an article that listed a database of over       different proteins that are found when you have pancreatic cancer. So  I decided to go and make it my new mission to go through all these proteins  and see which ones could serve as a bio marker for pancreatic cancer. And to make it a bit simpler for myself  I decided to map out scientific criteria  and here it is. Essentially  first  the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers  at high levels in the bloodstream  in the earliest stages  but also only in cancer. And so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task  and finally  on the      th try  when I'm close to losing my sanity  I find the protein. And the name of the protein I'd located was called mesothelin  and it's just your ordinary  run of the mill type protein  unless  of course  you have pancreatic  ovarian or lung cancer  in which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream. But also  the key is that it's found in the earliest stages of the disease  when someone has close to     percent chance of survival. So now that I'd found a reliable protein I could detect  I then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein  and thus  pancreatic cancer. Now  my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place  possibly the most unlikely place for innovation    my high school biology class  the absolute stifler of innovation. And I had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes  and that's just a long  thin pipe of carbon that's an atom thick  and one       th the diameter of your hair. And despite their extremely small sizes  they have these incredible properties. They're kind of like the superheroes of material science. And while I was sneakily reading this article under my desk in my biology class  we were supposed to be paying attention to these other kind of cool molecules  called antibodies. And these are pretty cool because they only react with one specific protein  but they're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes. And so then  I was sitting in class  and suddenly it hit me  I could combine what I was reading about  carbon nanotubes  with what I was supposed to be thinking about  antibodies. Essentially  I could weave a bunch of these antibodies into a network of carbon nanotubes  such that you have a network that only reacts with one protein  but also  due to the properties of these nanotubes  it will change its electrical properties  based on the amount of protein present. However  there's a catch. These networks of carbon nanotubes are extremely flimsy. And since they're so delicate  they need to be supported. So that's why I chose to use paper. Making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies  which I love. You start with some water  pour in some nanotubes  add antibodies  mix it up  take some paper  dip it  dry it  and you can detect cancer. Then  suddenly  a thought occurred that kind of put a blemish on my amazing plan here. I can't really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop. My mom wouldn't really like that. So instead  I decided to go for a lab. So I typed up a budget  a materials list  a timeline  and a procedure  and I emailed it to     different professors at Johns Hopkins University and the National Institutes of Health    essentially  anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer. I sat back waiting for these positive emails to be pouring in  saying   You're a genius  You're going to save us all   And    Then reality took hold  and over the course of a month  I got     rejections out of those     emails. One professor even went through my entire procedure  painstakingly    I'm not really sure where he got all this time    and he went through and said why each and every step was like the worst mistake I could ever make. Clearly  the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as I did. However  there is a silver lining. One professor said   Maybe I might be able to help you  kid.  So  I went in that direction. As you can never say no to a kid. And so then  three months later  I finally nailed down a harsh deadline with this guy  and I get into his lab  I get all excited  and then I sit down  I start opening my mouth and talking  and five seconds later  he calls in another Ph.D. Ph.D.s just flock into this little room  and they're just firing these questions at me  and by the end  I kind of felt like I was in a clown car. There were    Ph.D.s  plus me and the professor crammed into this tiny office space  with them firing these rapid fire questions at me  trying to sink my procedure. How unlikely is that  I mean  pshhh. However  subjecting myself to that interrogation    I answered all their questions  and I guessed on quite a few but I got them right    and I finally landed the lab space I needed. But it was shortly afterwards that I discovered my once brilliant procedure had something like a million holes in it  and over the course of seven months  I painstakingly filled each and every one of those holes. The result  One small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run. This makes it     times faster  over        times less expensive  and over     times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection. One of the best parts of the sensor  though  is that it has close to     percent accuracy  and can detect the cancer in the earliest stages  when someone has close to     percent chance of survival. And so in the next two to five years  this sensor could potentially lift the pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal  .  percent to close to     percent  and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer. But it wouldn't stop there. By switching out that antibody  you can look at a different protein  thus  a different disease    potentially any disease in the entire world. So that ranges from heart disease  to malaria  HIV  AIDS  as well as other forms of cancer    anything. And so  hopefully one day  we can all have that one extra uncle  that one mother  that one brother  sister  we can have that one more family member to love. And that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden that comes from pancreatic  ovarian and lung cancer  and potentially any disease. But through the Internet  anything is possible. Theories can be shared  and you don't have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued. It's a neutral space  where what you look like  age or gender    it doesn't matter. It's just your ideas that count. For me  it's all about looking at the Internet in an entirely new way  to realize that there's so much more to it than just posting duck face pictures of yourself online. You could be changing the world. So if a    year old who didn't even know what a pancreas was could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer    just imagine what you could do. Thank you. I'd like to talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education  by comparison. If you talk to someone today in America about sexual activity  you'll find pretty soon you're not just talking about sexual activity. You're also talking about baseball. Because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that Americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity  and we know that because there's all this language in English that seems to be talking about baseball but that's really talking about sexual activity. So  for example  you can be a pitcher or a catcher  and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act. Of course  there are the bases  which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order  ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run  which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm  at least for the guy. You can strike out  which means you don't get to have any sexual activity. And if you're a benchwarmer  you might be a virgin or somebody who for whatever reason isn't in the game  maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skillset. A bat's a penis  and a nappy dugout is a vulva  or a vagina. A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom. A switch hitter is a bisexual person  and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team. And then there's this one   if there's grass on the field  play ball.  And that usually refers to if a young person  specifically often a young woman  is old enough to have pubic hair  she's old enough to have sex with. This baseball model is incredibly problematic. It's sexist. It's heterosexist. It's competitive. It's goal directed. And it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults. So we need a new model. I'm here today to offer you that new model. And it's based on pizza. Now pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience. So let's do this. Let's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity  the trigger for sexual activity  what happens during sexual activity  and the expected outcome of sexual activity. So when do you play baseball  You play baseball when it's baseball season and when there's a game on the schedule. It's not exactly your choice. So if it's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren't home  hey  it's just batter up. Can you imagine saying to your coach   Uh  I'm not really feeling it today  I think I'll sit this game out.  That's just not the way it happens. And when you get together to play baseball  immediately you're with two opposing teams  one playing offense  one playing defense  somebody's trying to move deeper into the field. That's usually a sign to the boy. Somebody's trying to defend people moving into the field. That's often given to the girl. It's competitive. We're not playing with each other. We're playing against each other. And when you show up to play baseball  nobody needs to talk about what we're going to do or how this baseball game might be good for us. Everybody knows the rules. You just take your position and play the game. But when do you have pizza  Well  you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza. It starts with an internal sense  an internal desire  or a need.  Huh. I could go for some pizza.  And because it's an internal desire  we actually have some sense of control over that. I could decide that I'm hungry but know that it's not a great time to eat. And then when we get together with someone for pizza  we're not competing with them  we're looking for an experience that both of us will share that's satisfying for both of us  and when you get together for pizza with somebody  what's the first thing you do  You talk about it. You talk about what you want. You talk about what you like. You may even negotiate it.  How do you feel about pepperoni    Laughter   Not so much  I'm kind of a mushroom guy myself.   Well  maybe we can go half and half.  And even if you've had pizza with somebody for a very long time  don't you still say things like   Should we get the usual    Or maybe something a little more adventurous   Okay  so when you're playing baseball  so if we talk about during sexual activity  when you're playing baseball  you're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time. You can't hit the ball and run to right field. That doesn't work. And you also can't get to second base and say   I like it here. I'm going to stay here.  No. And also  of course  with baseball  there's  like  the specific equipment and a specific skill set. Not everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive. Okay  but what about pizza  When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza  isn't it all about what's our pleasure  There are a million different kinds of pizza. There's a million different toppings. There's a million different ways to eat pizza. And none of them are wrong. They're different. And in this case  difference is good  because that's going to increase the chance that we're having a satisfying experience. And lastly  what's the expected outcome of baseball  Well  in baseball  you play to win. You score as many runs as you can. There's always a winner in baseball  and that means there's always a loser in baseball. But what about pizza  Well  in pizza  we're not really    there's no winning. How do you win pizza  You don't. But you do look for   Are we satisfied   And sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days. And we get to decide when we feel satisfied. If we're still hungry  we might have some more. If you eat too much  though  you just feel gross. So what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education  A lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model  and it sets up education that can't help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people. And those young people become older people. But if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza  we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires  to make deliberate decisions about what they want  to talk about it with their partners  and to ultimately look for not some external outcome but for what feels satisfying  and we get to decide that. You may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison  under the baseball  it's all commands. They're all exclamation points. But under the pizza model  they're questions. And who gets to answer those questions  You do. I do. So remember  when we're thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity  baseball  you're out. Pizza is the way to think about healthy  satisfying sexual activity  and good  comprehensive sexuality education. Thank you very much for your time. When I first began recording wild soundscapes    years ago  I had no idea that ants  insect larvae  sea anemones and viruses created a sound signature. But they do. And so does every wild habitat on the planet  like the Amazon rainforest you're hearing behind me. In fact  temperate and tropical rainforests each produce a vibrant animal orchestra  that instantaneous and organized expression of insects  reptiles  amphibians  birds and mammals. And every soundscape that springs from a wild habitat generates its own unique signature  one that contains incredible amounts of information  and it's some of that information I want to share with you today. The soundscape is made up of three basic sources. The first is the geophony  or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat  like wind in the trees  water in a stream  waves at the ocean shore  movement of the Earth. The second of these is the biophony. The biophony is all of the sound that's generated by organisms in a given habitat at one time and in one place. And the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that's called anthrophony. Some of it is controlled  like music or theater  but most of it is chaotic and incoherent  which some of us refer to as noise. There was a time when I considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact. They were just there  but they had no significance. Well  I was wrong. What I learned from these encounters was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life. When I began recording in the late '  s  the typical methods of recording were limited to the fragmented capture of individual species like birds mostly  in the beginning  but later animals like mammals and amphibians. To me  this was a little like trying to understand the magnificence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra and hearing just that one part. Fortunately  more and more institutions are implementing the more holistic models that I and a few of my colleagues have introduced to the field of soundscape ecology. When I began recording over four decades ago  I could record for    hours and capture one hour of usable material  good enough for an album or a film soundtrack or a museum installation. Now  because of global warming  resource extraction  and human noise  among many other factors  it can take up to       hours or more to capture the same thing. Fully    percent of my archive comes from habitats so radically altered that they're either altogether silent or can no longer be heard in any of their original form. The usual methods of evaluating a habitat have been done by visually counting the numbers of species and the numbers of individuals within each species in a given area. However  by comparing data that ties together both density and diversity from what we hear  I'm able to arrive at much more precise fitness outcomes. And I want to show you some examples that typify the possibilities unlocked by diving into this universe. This is Lincoln Meadow. Lincoln Meadow's a three and a half hour drive east of San Francisco in the Sierra Nevada Mountains  at about       meters altitude  and I've been recording there for many years. In       a logging company convinced local residents that there would be absolutely no environmental impact from a new method they were trying called  selective logging   taking out a tree here and there rather than clear cutting a whole area. With permission granted to record both before and after the operation  I set up my gear and captured a large number of dawn choruses to very strict protocol and calibrated recordings  because I wanted a really good baseline. This is an example of a spectrogram. A spectrogram is a graphic illustration of sound with time from left to right across the page       seconds in this case is represented   and frequency from the bottom of the page to the top  lowest to highest. And you can see that the signature of a stream is represented here in the bottom third or half of the page  while birds that were once in that meadow are represented in the signature across the top. There were a lot of them. And here's Lincoln Meadow before selective logging. Well  a year later I returned  and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions  I recorded a number of examples of the same dawn choruses  and now this is what we've got. This is after selective logging. You can see that the stream is still represented in the bottom third of the page  but notice what's missing in the top two thirds. Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker. Well  I've returned to Lincoln Meadow    times in the last    years  and I can tell you that the biophony  the density and diversity of that biophony  has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation. But here's a picture of Lincoln Meadow taken after  and you can see that from the perspective of the camera or the human eye  hardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place  which would confirm the logging company's contention that there's nothing of environmental impact. However  our ears tell us a very different story. Young students are always asking me what these animals are saying  and really I've got no idea. But I can tell you that they do express themselves. Whether or not we understand it is a different story. I was walking along the shore in Alaska  and I came across this tide pool filled with a colony of sea anemones  these wonderful eating machines  relatives of coral and jellyfish. And curious to see if any of them made any noise  I dropped a hydrophone  an underwater microphone covered in rubber  down the mouth part  and immediately the critter began to absorb the microphone into its belly  and the tentacles were searching out of the surface for something of nutritional value. The static like sounds that are very low  that you're going to hear right now. Yeah  but watch. When it didn't find anything to eat    I think that's an expression that can be understood in any language. At the end of its breeding cycle  the Great Basin Spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard panned desert soil of the American West  where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are just right for it to emerge again. And when there's enough moisture in the soil in the spring  frogs will dig themselves to the surface and gather around these large  vernal pools in great numbers. And they vocalize in a chorus that's absolutely in sync with one another. And they do that for two reasons. The first is competitive  because they're looking for mates  and the second is cooperative  because if they're all vocalizing in sync together  it makes it really difficult for predators like coyotes  foxes and owls to single out any individual for a meal. This is a spectrogram of what the frog chorusing looks like when it's in a very healthy pattern. Mono Lake is just to the east of Yosemite National Park in California  and it's a favorite habitat of these toads  and it's also favored by U.S. Navy jet pilots  who train in their fighters flying them at speeds exceeding       kilometers an hour and altitudes only a couple hundred meters above ground level of the Mono Basin  very fast  very low  and so loud that the anthrophony  the human noise  even though it's six and a half kilometers from the frog pond you just heard a second ago  it masked the sound of the chorusing toads. You can see in this spectrogram that all of the energy that was once in the first spectrogram is gone from the top end of the spectrogram  and that there's breaks in the chorusing at two and a half  four and a half  and six and a half seconds  and then the sound of the jet  the signature  is in yellow at the very bottom of the page. Now at the end of that flyby  it took the frogs fully    minutes to regain their chorusing synchronicity  during which time  and under a full moon  we watched as two coyotes and a great horned owl came in to pick off a few of their numbers. The good news is that  with a little bit of habitat restoration and fewer flights  the frog populations  once diminishing during the     s and early '  s  have pretty much returned to normal. I want to end with a story told by a beaver. It's a very sad story  but it really illustrates how animals can sometimes show emotion  a very controversial subject among some older biologists. A colleague of mine was recording in the American Midwest around this pond that had been formed maybe        years ago at the end of the last ice age. It was also formed in part by a beaver dam at one end that held that whole ecosystem together in a very delicate balance. And one afternoon  while he was recording  there suddenly appeared from out of nowhere a couple of game wardens  who for no apparent reason  walked over to the beaver dam  dropped a stick of dynamite down it  blowing it up  killing the female and her young babies. Horrified  my colleagues remained behind to gather his thoughts and to record whatever he could the rest of the afternoon  and that evening  he captured a remarkable event  the lone surviving male beaver swimming in slow circles crying out inconsolably for its lost mate and offspring. This is probably the saddest sound I've ever heard coming from any organism  human or other. Yeah. Well. There are many facets to soundscapes  among them the ways in which animals taught us to dance and sing  which I'll save for another time. But you have heard how biophonies help clarify our understanding of the natural world. You've heard the impact of resource extraction  human noise and habitat destruction. And where environmental sciences have typically tried to understand the world from what we see  a much fuller understanding can be got from what we hear. Biophonies and geophonies are the signature voices of the natural world  and as we hear them  we're endowed with a sense of place  the true story of the world we live in. In a matter of seconds  a soundscape reveals much more information from many perspectives  from quantifiable data to cultural inspiration. Visual capture implicitly frames a limited frontal perspective of a given spatial context  while soundscapes widen that scope to a full     degrees  completely enveloping us. And while a picture may be worth       words  a soundscape is worth       pictures. And our ears tell us that the whisper of every leaf and creature speaks to the natural sources of our lives  which indeed may hold the secrets of love for all things  especially our own humanity  and the last word goes to a jaguar from the Amazon. Thank you for listening. Clouds. Have you ever noticed how much people moan about them  They get a bad rap. If you think about it  the English language has written into it negative associations towards the clouds. Someone who's down or depressed  they're under a cloud. And when there's bad news in store  there's a cloud on the horizon. I saw an article the other day. It was about problems with computer processing over the Internet.  A cloud over the cloud   was the headline. It seems like they're everyone's default doom and gloom metaphor. But I think they're beautiful  don't you  It's just that their beauty is missed because they're so omnipresent  so  I don't know  commonplace  that people don't notice them. They don't notice the beauty  but they don't even notice the clouds unless they get in the way of the sun. And so people think of clouds as things that get in the way. They think of them as the annoying  frustrating obstructions  and then they rush off and do some blue sky thinking. But most people  when you stop to ask them  will admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds. It's like a nostalgic fondness  and they make them think of their youth. Who here can't remember thinking  well  looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids  You know  when you were masters of daydreaming  Aristophanes  the ancient Greek playwright  he described the clouds as the patron godesses of idle fellows two and a half thousand years ago  and you can see what he means. It's just that these days  us adults seem reluctant to allow ourselves the indulgence of just allowing our imaginations to drift along in the breeze  and I think that's a pity. I think we should perhaps do a bit more of it. I think we should be a bit more willing  perhaps  to look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out from behind the clouds and go   Wait a minute  that's two cats dancing the salsa   Or seeing the big  white  puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the Abominable Snowman going to rob a bank. They're like nature's version of those inkblot images  you know  that shrinks used to show their patients in the '  s  and I think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds  you'll save money on psychoanalysis bills. Let's say you're in love. All right  And you look up and what do you see  Right  Or maybe the opposite. You've just been dumped by your partner  and everywhere you look  it's kissing couples. Perhaps you're having a moment of existential angst. You know  you're thinking about your own mortality. And there  on the horizon  it's the Grim Reaper. Or maybe you see a topless sunbather. What would that mean  What would that mean  I have no idea. But one thing I do know is this  The bad press that clouds get is totally unfair. I think we should stand up for them  which is why  a few years ago  I started the Cloud Appreciation Society. Tens of thousands of members now in almost     countries around the world. And all these photographs that I'm showing  they were sent in by members. And the society exists to remind people of this  Clouds are not something to moan about. Far from it. They are  in fact  the most diverse  evocative  poetic aspect of nature. I think  if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then  it helps you keep your feet on the ground. And I want to show you why  with the help of some of my favorite types of clouds. Let's start with this one. It's the cirrus cloud  named after the Latin for a lock of hair. It's composed entirely of ice crystals cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere  and as these ice crystals fall  they pass through different layers with different winds and they speed up and slow down  giving the cloud these brush stroked appearances  these brush stroke forms known as fall streaks. And these winds up there can be very  very fierce. They can be     miles an hour      miles an hour. These clouds are bombing along  but from all the way down here  they appear to be moving gracefully  slowly  like most clouds. And so to tune into the clouds is to slow down  to calm down. It's like a bit of everyday meditation. Those are common clouds. What about rarer ones  like the lenticularis  the UFO shaped lenticularis cloud  These clouds form in the region of mountains. When the wind passes  rises to pass over the mountain  it can take on a wave like path in the lee of the peak  with these clouds hovering at the crest of these invisible standing waves of air  these flying saucer like forms  and some of the early black and white UFO photos are in fact lenticularis clouds. It's true. A little rarer are the fallstreak holes. All right  This is when a layer is made up of very  very cold water droplets  and in one region they start to freeze  and this freezing sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards with the ice crystals cascading and falling down below  giving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below. Rarer still  the Kelvin Helmholtz cloud. Not a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand. This looks like a series of breaking waves  and it's caused by shearing winds    the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly  and in the middle  in between  you get this undulating of the air  and if the difference in those speeds is just right  the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave like vortices. All right. Those are rarer clouds than the cirrus  but they're not that rare. If you look up  and you pay attention to the sky  you'll see them sooner or later  maybe not quite as dramatic as these  but you'll see them. And you'll see them around where you live. Clouds are the most egalitarian of nature's displays  because we all have a good  fantastic view of the sky. And these clouds  these rarer clouds  remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday. Nothing is more nourishing  more stimulating to an active  inquiring mind than being surprised  being amazed. It's why we're all here at TED  right  But you don't need to rush off away from the familiar  across the world to be surprised. You just need to step outside  pay attention to what's so commonplace  so everyday  so mundane that everybody else misses it. One cloud that people rarely miss is this one  the cumulonimbus storm cloud. It's what's produces thunder and lightning and hail. These clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching    miles up into the atmosphere. They are an expression of the majestic architecture of our atmosphere. But from down below  they are the embodiment of the powerful  elemental force and power that drives our atmosphere. To be there is to be connected in the driving rain and the hail  to feel connected to our atmosphere. It's to be reminded that we are creatures that inhabit this ocean of air. We don't live beneath the sky. We live within it. And that connection  that visceral connection to our atmosphere feels to me like an antidote. It's an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life by watching it on a computer screen  you know  when we're in a wi fi zone. But the one cloud that best expresses why cloudspotting is more valuable today than ever is this one  the cumulus cloud. Right  It forms on a sunny day. If you close your eyes and think of a cloud  it's probably one of these that comes to mind. All those cloud shapes at the beginning  those were cumulus clouds. The sharp  crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in. And it reminds us of the aimless nature of cloudspotting  what an aimless activity it is. You're not going to change the world by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky  are you  It's pointless. It's a pointless activity  which is precisely why it's so important. The digital world conspires to make us feel eternally busy  perpetually busy. You know  when you're not dealing with the traditional pressures of earning a living and putting food on the table  raising a family  writing thank you letters  you have to now contend with answering a mountain of unanswered emails  updating a Facebook page  feeding your Twitter feed. And cloudspotting legitimizes doing nothing. And sometimes we need   Sometimes we need excuses to do nothing. We need to be reminded by these patron goddesses of idle fellows that slowing down and being in the present  not thinking about what you've got to do and what you should have done  but just being here  letting your imagination lift from the everyday concerns down here and just being in the present  it's good for you  and it's good for the way you feel. It's good for your ideas. It's good for your creativity. It's good for your soul. So keep looking up  marvel at the ephemeral beauty  and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds. Thank you very much. Where do you come from  It's such a simple question  but these days  of course  simple questions bring ever more complicated answers. People are always asking me where I come from  and they're expecting me to say India  and they're absolutely right insofar as     percent of my blood and ancestry does come from India. Except  I've never lived one day of my life there. I can't speak even one word of its more than        dialects. So I don't think I've really earned the right to call myself an Indian. And if  Where do you come from   means  Where were you born and raised and educated   then I'm entirely of that funny little country known as England  except I left England as soon as I completed my undergraduate education  and all the time I was growing up  I was the only kid in all my classes who didn't begin to look like the classic English heroes represented in our textbooks. And if  Where do you come from   means  Where do you pay your taxes  Where do you see your doctor and your dentist   then I'm very much of the United States  and I have been for    years now  since I was a really small child. Except  for many of those years  I've had to carry around this funny little pink card with green lines running through my face identifying me as a permanent alien. I do actually feel more alien the longer I live there. And if  Where do you come from   means  Which place goes deepest inside you and where do you try to spend most of your time   then I'm Japanese  because I've been living as much as I can for the last    years in Japan. Except  all of those years I've been there on a tourist visa  and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese would want to consider me one of them. And I say all this just to stress how very old fashioned and straightforward my background is  because when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver  most of the kids I meet are much more international and multi cultured than I am. And they have one home associated with their parents  but another associated with their partners  a third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be  a fourth connected with the place they dream of being  and many more besides. And their whole life will be spent taking pieces of many different places and putting them together into a stained glass whole. Home for them is really a work in progress. It's like a project on which they're constantly adding upgrades and improvements and corrections. And for more and more of us  home has really less to do with a piece of soil than  you could say  with a piece of soul. If somebody suddenly asks me   Where's your home   I think about my sweetheart or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be. And I'd always felt this way  but it really came home to me  as it were  some years ago when I was climbing up the stairs in my parents' house in California  and I looked through the living room windows and I saw that we were encircled by    foot flames  one of those wildfires that regularly tear through the hills of California and many other such places. And three hours later  that fire had reduced my home and every last thing in it except for me to ash. And when I woke up the next morning  I was sleeping on a friend's floor  the only thing I had in the world was a toothbrush I had just bought from an all night supermarket. Of course  if anybody asked me then   Where is your home   I literally couldn't point to any physical construction. My home would have to be whatever I carried around inside me. And in so many ways  I think this is a terrific liberation. Because when my grandparents were born  they pretty much had their sense of home  their sense of community  even their sense of enmity  assigned to them at birth  and didn't have much chance of stepping outside of that. And nowadays  at least some of us can choose our sense of home  create our sense of community  fashion our sense of self  and in so doing maybe step a little beyond some of the black and white divisions of our grandparents' age. No coincidence that the president of the strongest nation on Earth is half Kenyan  partly raised in Indonesia  has a Chinese Canadian brother in law. The number of people living in countries not their own now comes to     million  and that's an almost unimaginable number  but it means that if you took the whole population of Canada and the whole population of Australia and then the whole population of Australia again and the whole population of Canada again and doubled that number  you would still have fewer people than belong to this great floating tribe. And the number of us who live outside the old nation state categories is increasing so quickly  by    million just in the last    years  that soon there will be more of us than there are Americans. Already  we represent the fifth largest nation on Earth. And in fact  in Canada's largest city  Toronto  the average resident today is what used to be called a foreigner  somebody born in a very different country. And I've always felt that the beauty of being surrounded by the foreign is that it slaps you awake. You can't take anything for granted. Travel  for me  is a little bit like being in love  because suddenly all your senses are at the setting marked  on.  Suddenly you're alert to the secret patterns of the world. The real voyage of discovery  as Marcel Proust famously said  consists not in seeing new sights  but in looking with new eyes. And of course  once you have new eyes  even the old sights  even your home become something different. Many of the people living in countries not their own are refugees who never wanted to leave home and ache to go back home. But for the fortunate among us  I think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities. Certainly when I'm traveling  especially to the major cities of the world  the typical person I meet today will be  let's say  a half Korean  half German young woman living in Paris. And as soon as she meets a half Thai  half Canadian young guy from Edinburgh  she recognizes him as kin. She realizes that she probably has much more in common with him than with anybody entirely of Korea or entirely of Germany. So they become friends. They fall in love. They move to New York City. Or Edinburgh. And the little girl who arises out of their union will of course be not Korean or German or French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian or even American  but a wonderful and constantly evolving mix of all those places. And potentially  everything about the way that young woman dreams about the world  writes about the world  thinks about the world  could be something different  because it comes out of this almost unprecedented blend of cultures. Where you come from now is much less important than where you're going. More and more of us are rooted in the future or the present tense as much as in the past. And home  we know  is not just the place where you happen to be born. It's the place where you become yourself. And yet  there is one great problem with movement  and that is that it's really hard to get your bearings when you're in midair. Some years ago  I noticed that I had accumulated one million miles on United Airlines alone. You all know that crazy system  six days in hell  you get the seventh day free. And I began to think that really  movement was only as good as the sense of stillness that you could bring to it to put it into perspective. And eight months after my house burned down  I ran into a friend who taught at a local high school  and he said   I've got the perfect place for you.   Really   I said. I'm always a bit skeptical when people say things like that.  No  honestly   he went on   it's only three hours away by car  and it's not very expensive  and it's probably not like anywhere you've stayed before.   Hmm.  I was beginning to get slightly intrigued.  What is it    Well    Here my friend hemmed and hawed    Well  actually it's a Catholic hermitage.  This was the wrong answer. I had spent    years in Anglican schools  so I had had enough hymnals and crosses to last me a lifetime. Several lifetimes  actually. But my friend assured me that he wasn't Catholic  nor were most of his students  but he took his classes there every spring. And as he had it  even the most restless  distractible  testosterone addled    year old Californian boy only had to spend three days in silence and something in him cooled down and cleared out. He found himself. And I thought   Anything that works for a    year old boy ought to work for me.  So I got in my car  and I drove three hours north along the coast  and the roads grew emptier and narrower  and then I turned onto an even narrower path  barely paved  that snaked for two miles up to the top of a mountain. And when I got out of my car  the air was pulsing. The whole place was absolutely silent  but the silence wasn't an absence of noise. It was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening. And at my feet was the great  still blue plate of the Pacific Ocean. All around me were     acres of wild dry brush. And I went down to the room in which I was to be sleeping. Small but eminently comfortable  it had a bed and a rocking chair and a long desk and even longer picture windows looking out on a small  private  walled garden  and then       feet of golden pampas grass running down to the sea. And I sat down  and I began to write  and write  and write  even though I'd gone there really to get away from my desk. And by the time I got up  four hours had passed. Night had fallen  and I went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars  and I could see the tail lights of cars disappearing around the headlands    miles to the south. And it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day vanishing. And the next day  when I woke up in the absence of telephones and TVs and laptops  the days seemed to stretch for a thousand hours. It was really all the freedom I know when I'm traveling  but it also profoundly felt like coming home. And I'm not a religious person  so I didn't go to the services. I didn't consult the monks for guidance. I just took walks along the monastery road and sent postcards to loved ones. I looked at the clouds  and I did what is hardest of all for me to do usually  which is nothing at all. And I started to go back to this place  and I noticed that I was doing my most important work there invisibly just by sitting still  and certainly coming to my most critical decisions the way I never could when I was racing from the last email to the next appointment. And I began to think that something in me had really been crying out for stillness  but of course I couldn't hear it because I was running around so much. I was like some crazy guy who puts on a blindfold and then complains that he can't see a thing. And I thought back to that wonderful phrase I had learned as a boy from Seneca  in which he says   That man is poor not who has little but who hankers after more.  And  of course  I'm not suggesting that anybody here go into a monastery. That's not the point. But I do think it's only by stopping movement that you can see where to go. And it's only by stepping out of your life and the world that you can see what you most deeply care about and find a home. And I've noticed so many people now take conscious measures to sit quietly for    minutes every morning just collecting themselves in one corner of the room without their devices  or go running every evening  or leave their cell phones behind when they go to have a long conversation with a friend. Movement is a fantastic privilege  and it allows us to do so much that our grandparents could never have dreamed of doing. But movement  ultimately  only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to. And home  in the end  is of course not just the place where you sleep. It's the place where you stand. Thank you. Miranda Wang  We're here to talk about accidents. How do you feel about accidents  When we think about accidents  we usually consider them to be harmful  unfortunate or even dangerous  and they certainly can be. But are they always that bad  The discovery that had led to penicillin  for example  is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time. Without biologist Alexander Fleming's moldy accident  caused by a neglected workstation  we wouldn't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections. Jeanny Yao  Miranda and I are here today because we'd like to share how our accidents have led to discoveries. In       we visited the Vancouver Waste Transfer Station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste. We realized that when plastics get to the dump  it's difficult to sort them because they have similar densities  and when they're mixed with organic matter and construction debris  it's truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them. MW  However  plastics are useful because they're durable  flexible  and can be easily molded into so many useful shapes. The downside of this convenience is that there's a high cost to this. Plastics cause serious problems  such as the destruction of ecosystems  the pollution of natural resources  and the reduction of available land space. This picture you see here is the Great Pacific Gyre. When you think about plastic pollution and the marine environment  we think about the Great Pacific Gyre  which is supposed to be a floating island of plastic waste. But that's no longer an accurate depiction of plastic pollution in the marine environment. Right now  the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris  and there's nowhere you can go in the ocean where you wouldn't be able to find plastic particles. JY  In a plastic dependent society  cutting down production is a good goal  but it's not enough. And what about the waste that's already been produced  Plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade. So we thought  you know what  Instead of waiting for that garbage to sit there and pile up  let's find a way to break them down with bacteria. Sounds cool  right  Audience  Yeah. JY  Thank you. But we had a problem. You see  plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade. Anyhow  we were curious and hopeful and still wanted to give it a go. MW  With this idea in mind  Jeanny and I read through some hundreds of scientific articles on the Internet  and we drafted a research proposal in the beginning of our grade    year. We aimed to find bacteria from our local Fraser River that can degrade a harmful plasticizer called phthalates. Phthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexibility  durability and transparency. Although they're part of the plastic  they're not covalently bonded to the plastic backbone. As a result  they easily escape into our environment. Not only do phthalates pollute our environment  but they also pollute our bodies. To make the matter worse  phthalates are found in products to which we have a high exposure  such as babies' toys  beverage containers  cosmetics  and even food wraps. Phthalates are horrible because they're so easily taken into our bodies. They can be absorbed by skin contact  ingested  and inhaled. JY  Every year  at least     million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air  water and soil. The Environmental Protection Agency even classified this group as a top priority pollutant because it's been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor. We read that each year  the Vancouver municipal government monitors phthalate concentration levels in rivers to assess their safety. So we figured  if there are places along our Fraser River that are contaminated with phthalates  and if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas  then perhaps  perhaps these bacteria could have evolved to break down phthalates. MW  So we presented this good idea to Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the University of British Columbia  and surprisingly  he actually took us into his lab and asked his graduate students Adam and James to help us. Little did we know at that time that a trip to the dump and some research on the Internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life changing journey of accidents and discoveries. JY  The first step in our project was to collect soil samples from three different sites along the Fraser River. Out of thousands of bacteria  we wanted to find ones that could break down phthalates  so we enriched our cultures with phthalates as the only carbon source. This implied that  if anything grew in our cultures  then they must be able to live off of phthalates. Everything went well from there  and we became amazing scientists.  Laughter  MW  Um... uh  Jeanny. JY  I'm just joking. MW  Okay. Well  it was partially my fault. You see  I accidentally cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture  and as a result  we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice. And this is only one of the examples of the many accidents that happened during our experimentation. But this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous. We noticed that the unharmed cultures came from places of opposite contamination levels  so this mistake actually led us to think that perhaps we can compare the different degradative potentials of bacteria from sites of opposite contamination levels. JY  Now that we grew the bacteria  we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates  because we thought that would be less accident prone  but we were wrong again. We poked holes in our agar while streaking and contaminated some samples and funghi. As a result  we had to streak and restreak several times. Then we monitored phthalate utilization and bacterial growth  and found that they shared an inverse correlation  so as bacterial populations increased  phthalate concentrations decreased. This means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates. MW  So now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates  we wondered what these bacteria were. So Jeanny and I took three of our most efficient strains and then performed gene amplification sequencing on them and matched our data with an online comprehensive database. We were happy to see that  although our three strains had been previously identified bacteria  two of them were not previously associated with phthalate degradation  so this was actually a novel discovery. JY  To better understand how this biodegradation works  we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways of our three strains. To do this  we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid. MW  We monitored this experiment with spectrophotometry and obtained this beautiful graph. This graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates. Our bacteria can transform phthalates  which is a harmful toxin  into end products such as carbon dioxide  water and alcohol. I know some of you in the crowd are thinking  well  carbon dioxide is horrible  it's a greenhouse gas. But if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates  they would have used some other kind of carbon source  and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway. We were also interested to see that  although we've obtained greater diversity of bacteria biodegraders from the bird habitat site  we obtained the most efficient degraders from the landfill site. So this fully shows that nature evolves through natural selection. JY  So Miranda and I shared this research at the Sanofi BioGENEius Challenge competition and were recognized with the greatest commercialization potential. Although we're not the first ones to find bacteria that can break down phthalates  we were the first ones to look into our local river and find a possible solution to a local problem. We have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution  but also that being open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries. Throughout this journey  we have also discovered our passion for science  and are currently continuing research on other fossil fuel chemicals in university. We hope that in the near future  we'll be able to create model organisms that can break down not only phthalates but a wide variety of different contaminants. We can apply this to wastewater treatment plants to clean up our rivers and other natural resources. And perhaps one day we'll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste. MW  I think our journey has truly transformed our view of microorganisms  and Jeanny and I have shown that even mistakes can lead to discoveries. Einstein once said   You can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking you used when you created them.  If we're making plastic synthetically  then we think the solution would be to break them down biochemically. Thank you. JY  Thank you. My name is Tom  and I've come here today to come clean about what I do for money. Basically  I use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for cash. I usually do this kind of thing in seedy downtown bars and on street corners  so this mightn't be the most appropriate setting  but I'd like to give you guys a bit of a demonstration about what I do. And now  for my next number  I'd like to return to the classics. We're going to take it back  way back  back into time.   Billie Jean is not my lover     She's just a girl who claims that I am the one     But the kid is not my son   Wassup. Thank you very much  TEDx. If you guys haven't figured it out already  my name's Tom Thum  and I'm a beatboxer  which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice  and the only thing was my voice. And I can assure you there are absolutely no effects on this microphone whatsoever. And I'm very  very stoked   You guys are just applauding for everything. It's great. Look at this  Mom  I made it  I'm very  very stoked to be here today  representing my kinfolk and all those that haven't managed to make a career out of an innate ability for inhuman noisemaking. Because it is a bit of a niche market  and there's not much work going on  especially where I'm from. You know  I'm from Brisbane  which is a great city to live in. Yeah  All right  Most of Brisbane's here. That's good. You know  I'm from Brizzy  which is a great city to live in  but let's be honest    it's not exactly the cultural hub of the Southern Hemisphere. So I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane and outside Australia  and so the pursuit of this crazy passion of mine has enabled me to see so many amazing places in the world. So I'd like to share with you  if I may  my experiences. So ladies and gentlemen  I would like to take you on a journey throughout the continents and throughout sound itself. We start our journey in the central deserts. India. China. Germany. Party  party  yeah. And before we reach our final destination  ladies and gentlemen  I would like to share with you some technology that I brought all the way from the thriving metropolis of Brisbane. These things in front of me here are called Kaoss Pads  and they allow me to do a whole lot of different things with my voice. For example  the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound  which gives me that    flavor. And the other ones here  I can use them in unison to mimic the effect of a drum machine or something like that. I can sample in my own sounds and I can play it back just by hitting the pads here. TEDx. I got way too much time on my hands. And last but not least  the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice. So with all that in mind  ladies and gentlemen  I would like to take you on a journey to a completely separate part of Earth as I transform the Sydney Opera House into a smoky downtown jazz bar. All right boys  take it away. Ladies and gentlemen  I'd like to introduce you to a very special friend of mine  one of the greatest double bassists I know. Mr. Smokey Jefferson  let's take it for a walk. Come on  baby. All right  ladies and gentlemen  I'd like to introduce you to the star of the show  one of the greatest jazz legends of our time. Music lovers and jazz lovers alike  please give a warm hand of applause for the one and only Mr. Peeping Tom. Take it away. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk about consciousness. Why consciousness  Well  it's a curiously neglected subject  both in our scientific and our philosophical culture. Now why is that curious  Well  it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple  logical reason  namely  it's a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we're conscious. You care about science  philosophy  music  art  whatever    it's no good if you're a zombie or in a coma  right  So consciousness is number one. The second reason is that when people do get interested in it  as I think they should  they tend to say the most appalling things. And then  even when they're not saying appalling things and they're really trying to do serious research  well  it's been slow. Progress has been slow. When I first got interested in this  I thought  well  it's a straightforward problem in biology. Let's get these brain stabbers to get busy and figure out how it works in the brain. So I went over to UCSF and I talked to all the heavy duty neurobiologists there  and they showed some impatience  as scientists often do when you ask them embarrassing questions. But the thing that struck me is  one guy said in exasperation  a very famous neurobiologist  he said   Look  in my discipline it's okay to be interested in consciousness  but get tenure first. Get tenure first.  Now I've been working on this for a long time. I think now you might actually get tenure by working on consciousness. If so  that's a real step forward. Okay  now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness  Well  I think it's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions. One feature is the tradition of religious dualism  Consciousness is not a part of the physical world. It's a part of the spiritual world. It belongs to the soul  and the soul is not a part of the physical world. That's the tradition of God  the soul and immortality. There's another tradition that thinks it's opposed to this but accepts the worst assumption. That tradition thinks that we are heavy duty scientific materialists  Consciousness is not a part of the physical world. Either it doesn't exist at all  or it's something else  a computer program or some damn fool thing  but in any case it's not part of science. And I used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache. Here's how it went. Science is objective  consciousness is subjective  therefore there cannot be a science of consciousness. Okay  so these twin traditions are paralyzing us. It's very hard to get out of these twin traditions. And I have only one real message in this lecture  and that is  consciousness is a biological phenomenon like photosynthesis  digestion  mitosis    you know all the biological phenomena    and once you accept that  most  though not all  of the hard problems about consciousness simply evaporate. And I'm going to go through some of them. Okay  now I promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness. One  Consciousness does not exist. It's an illusion  like sunsets. Science has shown sunsets and rainbows are illusions. So consciousness is an illusion. Two  Well  maybe it exists  but it's really something else. It's a computer program running in the brain. Three  No  the only thing that exists is really behavior. It's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was  but I'll get back to that. And four  Maybe consciousness exists  but it can't make any difference to the world. How could spirituality move anything  Now  whenever somebody tells me that  I think  you want to see spirituality move something  Watch. I decide consciously to raise my arm  and the damn thing goes up.  Laughter  Furthermore  notice this  We do not say   Well  it's a bit like the weather in Geneva. Some days it goes up and some days it doesn't go up.  No. It goes up whenever I damn well want it to. Okay. I'm going to tell you how that's possible. Now  I haven't yet given you a definition. You can't do this if you don't give a definition. People always say consciousness is very hard to define. I think it's rather easy to define if you're not trying to give a scientific definition. We're not ready for a scientific definition  but here's a common sense definition. Consciousness consists of all those states of feeling or sentience or awareness. It begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep  and it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious. Dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition. Now  that's the common sense definition. That's our target. If you're not talking about that  you're not talking about consciousness. But they think   Well  if that's it  that's an awful problem. How can such a thing exist as part of the real world   And this  if you've ever had a philosophy course  this is known as the famous mind body problem. I think that has a simple solution too. I'm going to give it to you. And here it is  All of our conscious states  without exception  are caused by lower level neurobiological processes in the brain  and they are realized in the brain as higher level or system features. It's about as mysterious as the liquidity of water. Right  The liquidity is not an extra juice squirted out by the H O molecules. It's a condition that the system is in. And just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules  so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious  depending on the behavior of the molecules. The famous mind body problem is that simple. All right  But now we get into some harder questions. Let's specify the exact features of consciousness  so that we can then answer those four objections that I made to it. Well  the first feature is  it's real and irreducible. You can't get rid of it. You see  the distinction between reality and illusion is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are. It consciously seems like there's    I like the French  arc en ciel    it seems like there's an arch in the sky  or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains. It consciously seems to us  but that's not really happening. But for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are  you can't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness  because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned  if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious  you are conscious. I mean  if a bunch of experts come to me and say   We are heavy duty neurobiologists and we've done a study of you  Searle  and we're convinced you are not conscious  you are a very cleverly constructed robot   I don't think   Well  maybe these guys are right  you know   I don't think that for a moment  because  I mean  Descartes may have made a lot of mistakes  but he was right about this. You cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness. Okay  that's the first feature of consciousness. It's real and irreducible. You cannot get rid of it by showing that it's an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions. Okay  the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us  and that is  all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them. There's something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income tax or listen to music  and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature  namely  conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject  some self that experiences them. Maybe we'll be able to build a conscious machine. Since we don't know how our brains do it  we're not in a position  so far  to build a conscious machine. Okay. Another feature of consciousness is that it comes in unified conscious fields. So I don't just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes against the floor  but they occur to me as part of one single great conscious field that stretches forward and backward. That is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness. And we have not been able to do that in a robot. The disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don't know how to make a conscious robot  so we don't have a machine that can do this kind of thing. Okay  the next feature of consciousness  after this marvelous unified conscious field  is that it functions causally in our behavior. I gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand  but how is that possible  How can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects  Well  I'll tell you the answer. I mean  we don't know the detailed answer  but we know the basic part of the answer  and that is  there is a sequence of neuron firings  and they terminate where the acetylcholine is secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons. Sorry to use philosophical terminology here  but when it's secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons  a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up. Now  think of what I told you. One and the same event  my conscious decision to raise my arm has a level of description where it has all of these touchy feely spiritual qualities. It's a thought in my brain  but at the same time  it's busy secreting acetylcholine and doing all sorts of other things as it makes its way from the motor cortex down through the nerve fibers in the arm. Now  what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are totally obsolete. One and the same event has a level of description where it's neurobiological  and another level of description where it's mental  and that's a single event  and that's how nature works. That's how it's possible for consciousness to function causally. Okay  now with that in mind  with going through these various features of consciousness  let's go back and answer some of those early objections. Well  the first one I said was  consciousness doesn't exist  it's an illusion. Well  I've already answered that. I don't think we need to worry about that. But the second one had an incredible influence  and may still be around  and that is   Well  if consciousness exists  it's really something else. It's really a digital computer program running in your brain and that's what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program. Yeah  forget about the hardware. Any hardware will do provided it's rich enough and stable enough to carry the program.  Now  we know that that's wrong. I mean  anybody who's thought about computers at all can see that that's wrong  because computation is defined as symbol manipulation  usually thought of as zeros as ones  but any symbols will do. You get an algorithm that you can program in a binary code  and that's the defining trait of the computer program. But we know that that's purely syntactical. That's symbolic. We know that actual human consciousness has something more than that. It's got a content in addition to the syntax. It's got a semantics. Now that argument  I made that argument       oh my God  I don't want to think about it   more than    years ago  but there's a deeper argument implicit in what I've told you  and I want to tell you that argument briefly  and that is  consciousness creates an observer independent reality. It creates a reality of money  property  government  marriage  CERN conferences  cocktail parties and summer vacations  and all of those are creations of consciousness. Their existence is observer relative. It's only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university. Now  ask yourself about computation. Is that absolute  like force and mass and gravitational attraction  Or is it observer relative  Well  some computations are intrinsic. I add two plus two to get four. That's going on no matter what anybody thinks. But when I haul out my pocket calculator and do the calculation  the only intrinsic phenomenon is the electronic circuit and its behavior. That's the only absolute phenomenon. All the rest is interpreted by us. Computation only exists relative to consciousness. Either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation  or he's got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation. Now that doesn't mean computation is arbitrary. I spent a lot of money on this hardware. But we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims. And the bottom line of this part of my talk is this  You can have a completely objective science  a science where you make objectively true claims  about a domain whose existence is subjective  whose existence is in the human brain consisting of subjective states of sentience or feeling or awareness. So the objection that you can't have an objective science of consciousness because it's subjective and science is objective  that's a pun. That's a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity. You can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence  and indeed that's what neurologists do. I mean  you have patients that actually suffer pains  and you try to get an objective science of that. Okay  I promised to refute all these guys  and I don't have an awful lot of time left  but let me refute a couple more of them. I said that behaviorism ought to be one of the great embarrassments of our intellectual culture  because it's refuted the moment you think about it. Your mental states are identical with your behavior  Well  think about the distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior. I won't demonstrate pain behavior  but I can tell you I'm not having any pains right now. So it's an obvious mistake. Why did they make the mistake  The mistake was   and you can go back and read the literature on this  you can see this over and over   they think if you accept the irreducible existence of consciousness  you're giving up on science. You're giving up on     years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it. And the message I want to leave you with is  consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological phenomenon  as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology  or  for that matter  the rest of science. Thank you very much. I love paper  and I love technology  and what I do is I make paper interactive. And that's what I say when people ask me what I do  but it really confuses most people  so really  the best way for me to convey it is to take the technology and be creative and create experiences. So I tried to think what I could use for here  and a couple of weeks ago I had a crazy idea that I wanted to print two DJ decks and to try and mix some music. And I'm going to try and show that at the end  and the suspense will be as much mine if it works. And I'm not a DJ  and I'm not a musician  so I'm a little bit scared of that. So I think  I found the best way to describe my journey is just to mention a few little things that have happened to me throughout my life. There's three particular things that I've done  and I'll just describe those first  and then talk about some of my work. So when I was a kid  I was obsessed with wires  and I used to thread them under my carpet and thread them behind the walls and have little switches and little speakers  and I wanted to make my bedroom be interactive but kind of all hidden away. And I was also really interested in wireless as well. So I bought one of those little kits that you could get to make a radio transmitter  and I got an old book and I carved out the inside and I hid it inside there  and then I placed it next to my dad and snuck back to my bedroom and tuned in on the radio so I could eavesdrop. I was not at all interested in what he was saying. It's more that I just liked the idea of an everyday object having something inside and doing something different. Several year later  I managed to successfully fail all of my exams and didn't really leave school with much to show for at all  and my parents  maybe as a reward  bought me what turned out to be a one way ticket to Australia  and I came back home about four years later. I ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere. It was in far western New South Wales. And this farm was         acres. There were        sheep  and it was about    degrees  or     or so Fahrenheit. And on this farm there was the farmer  his wife  and there was the four year old daughter. And they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work. Obviously  one of the most important things was the sheep  and so my job was  well  pretty much to do everything  but it was about bringing the sheep back to the homestead. And we'd do that by building fences  using motorbikes and horses  and the sheep would make their way all the way back to the shearing shed for the different seasons. And what I learned was  although at the time  like everyone else  I thought sheep were pretty stupid because they didn't do what we wanted them to do  what I realize now  probably only just in the last few weeks looking back  is the sheep weren't stupid at all. We'd put them in an environment where they didn't want to be  and they didn't want to do what we wanted them to do. So the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by listening to the weather  the lay of the land  and creating things that would let the sheep flow and go where we wanted them to go. Another bunch of years later  I ended up at Cambridge University at the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K. doing a Ph.D. in physics. My Ph.D. was to move electrons around  one at a time. And I realize   again  it's kind of these realizations looking back as to what I did   I realize now that it was pretty much the same as moving sheep around. It really is. It's just you do it by changing an environment. And that's kind of been a big lesson to me  that you can't act on any object. You change its environment  and the object will flow. So we made it very small  so things were about    nanometers in size  making it very cold  so at liquid helium temperatures  and changing environment by changing the voltage  and the electrons could make flow around a loop one at a time  on and off  a little memory node. And I wanted to go one step further  and I wanted to move one electron on and one electron off. And I was told that I wouldn't be able to do this  which  you know  as we've heard from other people  that's the thing that makes you do it. And I was determined  and I managed to show that I could do that. And a lot of that learning  I think  came from being on that farm  because when I was working on the farm  we'd have to use what was around us  we'd have to use the environment  and there was no such thing as something can't be done  because you're in an environment where  if you can't do what you need to do  you can die  and  you know  I had seen that sort of thing happen. So now my obsession is printing  and I'm really fascinated by the idea of using conventional printing processes  so the types of print that are used to create many of the things around us to make paper and card interactive. When I spoke to some printers when I started doing this and told them what I wanted to do  which was to print conductive inks onto paper  they told me it couldn't be done  again  that kind of favorite thing. So I got about    credit cards and loans and got myself very close to bankruptcy  really  and bought myself this huge printing press  which I had no idea how to use at all. It was about five meters long  and I covered myself and the floor with ink and made a massive mess  but I learned to print. And then I took it back to the printers and showed them what I've done  and they were like   Of course you can do that. Why didn't you come here in the first place   That's always the case. So what we do is we take conventional printing presses  we make conductive inks  and run those through a press  and basically just letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow through pieces of paper so we can make that paper interactive. And it's pretty simple  really. It's just a collection of things that have been done before  but bringing them together in a different way. So we have a piece of paper with conductive ink on  and then add onto that a small circuit board with a couple of chips  one to run some capacitive touch software  so we know where we've touched it  and the other to run  quite often  some wireless software so the piece of paper can connect. So I'll just describe a couple of things that we've created. There's lots of different things we've created. This is one of them  because I love cake. And this one  it's a large poster  and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it  and the poster talks to you when you touch it and asks you a series of questions  and it works out your perfect cake. But it doesn't tell you the cake there and then. It uploads a picture  and the reason why it chose that cake for you  to our Facebook page and to Twitter. So we're trying to create that connection between the physical and the digital  but have it not looking on a screen  and just looking like a regular poster. We've worked with a bunch of universities on a project looking at interactive newsprint. So for example  we've created a newspaper  a regular newspaper. You can wear a pair of headphones that are connected to it wirelessly  and when you touch it  you can hear the music that's described on the top  which is something you can't read. You can hear a press conference as well as reading what the editor has determined that press conference was about. And you can press a Facebook  like  button or you can vote on something as well. Something else that we created  and this was an idea that I had a couple of years ago  and so we've done a project on this. It was for funding from the government for user centered design for energy efficient buildings  difficult to say  and something I had no idea what it was when I went into the workshop  but quickly learned. And we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better. And I really liked the idea that  instead of looking at dials and reading things to say    looking at your energy usage  I wanted to create a poster that was wirelessly connected and had color changing inks on it  and so if your energy usage was trending better  than the leaves would appear and the rabbits would appear and all would be good. And if it wasn't  then there'd be graffiti and the leaves would fall off the trees. So it was trying to make you look after something in your immediate environment  which you don't want to see not looking so good  rather than expecting people to do things in the local environment because of the effect that it has a long way off. And I think  kind of like going back to the farm  it's about how to let people do what you want them to do rather than making people do what you want them to do. Okay. So this is the bit I'm really scared of. So a couple of things I've created are  there's a poster over here that you can play drums on. And I am not a musician. It seemed like a good idea at the time. If anyone wants to try and play drums  then they can. I'll just describe how this works. This poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone  and when you touch it  it connects to the app. And it has really good response time. It's using Bluetooth    so it's pretty instantaneous. Okay. Thanks. And there's a couple of other things. So this one is like a sound board  so you can touch it  and I just love these horrible noises. Okay  and this is a D.J. turntable. So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad  and this is a software that's running on the iPad. Oh  yes. I just love doing that. I'm not a D.J.  though  but I just always wanted to do that. So I have a crossfader  and I have the two decks. So I've made some new technology  and I love things being creative  and I love working with creative people. So my    year old niece  she's amazing  and she's called Charlotte  and I asked her to record something  and I worked with a friend called Elliot to put some beats together. So this is my niece  Charlotte. Yay  So that's pretty much what I do. I just love bringing technology together  having a lot of fun  being creative. But it's not about the technology. It's just about  I want to create some great experiences. So thank you very much. Francesca Fedeli  Ciao. So he's Mario. He's our son. He was born two and a half years ago  and I had a pretty tough pregnancy because I had to stay still in a bed for  like  eight months. But in the end everything seemed to be under control. So he got the right weight at birth. He got the right Apgar index. So we were pretty reassured by this. But at the end     days later after he was born  we discovered that he had a stroke. As you might know  a stroke is a brain injury. A perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth  and in his case  as you can see  the right part of his brain has gone. So the effect that this stroke could have on Mario's body could be the fact that he couldn't be able to control the left side of his body. Just imagine  if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit  to input to print out a document  but the printer doesn't have the right drives  so the same is for Mario. It's just like  he would like to move his left side of his body  but he's not able to transmit the right input to move his left arm and left leg. So life had to change. We needed to change our schedule. We needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life. Roberto D'Angelo  As you may imagine  unfortunately  we were not ready. Nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities  and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds. And that has been really a tough time. Questions  some basics  like  you know  why did this happen to us  And what went wrong  Some more tough  like  really  what will be the impact on Mario's life  I mean  at the end  will he be able to work  Will he be able to be normal  And  you know  as a parent  especially for the first time  why is he not going to be better than us  And this  indeed  really is tough to say  but a few months later  we realized that we were really feeling like a failure. I mean  the only real product of our life  at the end  was a failure. And you know  it was not a failure for ourselves in itself  but it was a failure that will impact his full life. Honestly  we went down. I mean we went really down  but at the end  we started to look at him  and we said  we have to react. So immediately  as Francesca said  we changed our life. We started physiotherapy  we started the rehabilitation  and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot. Basically  we spent months doing this with Mario. You have an object  and we showed him how to grab the object. Now  the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains  exactly now  as you watch me doing this  you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions. It looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation. But one day we found that Mario was not looking at our hand. He was looking at us. We were his mirror. And the problem  as you might feel  is that we were down  we were depressed  we were looking at him as a problem  not as a son  not from a positive perspective. And that day really changed our perspective. We realized that we had to become a better mirror for Mario. We restarted from our strengths  and at the same time we restarted from his strengths. We stopped looking at him as a problem  and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve. And really  this was the change  and from our side  we said   What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario   And we started from our passions. I mean  at the end  my wife and myself are quite different  but we have many things in common. We love to travel  we love music  we love to be in places like this  and we started to bring Mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him. This short video is from last week. I am not saying    I am not saying it's a miracle. That's not the message  because we are just at the beginning of the path. But we want to share what was the key learning  the key learning that Mario drove to us  and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss  and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity. And this is the message that we want to share with you. This is why we are here. Mario  And this is why    And this is why we decided to share the best mirror in the world with him. And we thank you so much  all of you. FF  Thank you. RD  Thank you. Bye. FF  Thank you.  Applause  So if I was to ask you what the connection between a bottle of Tide detergent and sweat was  you'd probably think that's the easiest question that you're going to be asked in Edinburgh all week. But if I was to say that they're both examples of alternative or new forms of currency in a hyperconnected  data driven global economy  you'd probably think I was a little bit bonkers. But trust me  I work in advertising. And I am going to tell you the answer  but obviously after this short break. So a more challenging question is one that I was asked  actually  by one of our writers a couple of weeks ago  and I didn't know the answer  What's the world's best performing currency  It's actually Bitcoin. Now  for those of you who may not be familiar  Bitcoin is a crypto currency  a virtual currency  synthetic currency. It was founded in      by this anonymous programmer using a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. No one knows who or what he is. He's almost like the Banksy of the Internet. And I'm probably not going to do it proper service here  but my interpretation of how it works is that Bitcoins are released through this process of mining. So there's a network of computers that are challenged to solve a very complex mathematical problem and the person that manages to solve it first gets the Bitcoins. And the Bitcoins are released  they're put into a public ledger called the Blockchain  and then they float  so they become a currency  and completely decentralized  that's the sort of scary thing about this  which is why it's so popular. So it's not run by the authorities or the state. It's actually managed by the network. And the reason that it's proved very successful is it's private  it's anonymous  it's fast  and it's cheap. And you do get to the point where there's some wild fluctuations with Bitcoin. So in one level it went from something like    dollars to      literally in the space of four months  and then crashed and lost half of its value in six hours. And it's currently around that kind of     dollar mark in value. But what it does show is that it's sort of gaining ground  it's gaining respectability. You get services  like Reddit and Wordpress are actually accepting Bitcoin as a payment currency now. And that's showing you that people are actually placing trust in technology  and it's started to trump and disrupt and interrogate traditional institutions and how we think about currencies and money. And that's not surprising  if you think about the basket case that is the E.U. I think there was a Gallup survey out recently that said something like  in America  trust in banks is at an all time low  it's something like    percent. And you can see here some photographs from London where Barclays sponsored the city bike scheme  and some activists have done some nice piece of guerrilla marketing here and doctored the slogans.  Sub prime pedaling.   Barclays takes you for a ride.  These are the more polite ones I could share with you today. But you get the gist  so people have really started to sort of lose faith in institutions. There's a P.R. company called Edelman  they do this very interesting survey every year precisely around trust and what people are thinking. And this is a global survey  so these numbers are global. And what's interesting is that you can see that hierarchy is having a bit of a wobble  and it's all about heterarchical now  so people trust people like themselves more than they trust corporations and governments. And if you look at these figures for the more developed markets like U.K.  Germany  and so on  they're actually much lower. And I find that sort of scary. People are actually trusting businesspeople more than they're trusting governments and leaders. So what's starting to happen  if you think about money  if you sort of boil money down to an essence  it is literally just an expression of value  an agreed value. So what's happening now  in the digital age  is that we can quantify value in lots of different ways and do it more easily  and sometimes the way that we quantify those values  it makes it much easier to create new forms and valid forms of currency. In that context  you can see that networks like Bitcoin suddenly start to make a bit more sense. So if you think we're starting to question and disrupt and interrogate what money means  what our relationship with it is  what defines money  then the ultimate extension of that is  is there a reason for the government to be in charge of money anymore  So obviously I'm looking at this through a marketing prism  so from a brand perspective  brands literally stand or fall on their reputations. And if you think about it  reputation has now become a currency. You know  reputations are built on trust  consistency  transparency. So if you've actually decided that you trust a brand  you want a relationship  you want to engage with the brand  you're already kind of participating in lots of new forms of currency. So you think about loyalty. Loyalty essentially is a micro economy. You think about rewards schemes  air miles. The Economist said a few years ago that there are actually more unredeemed air miles in the world than there are dollar bills in circulation. You know  when you are standing in line in Starbucks     percent of transactions in Starbucks on any one day are actually being made with Starbucks Star points. So that's a sort of Starbucks currency staying within its ecosystem. And what I find interesting is that Amazon has recently launched Amazon coins. So admittedly it's a currency at the moment that's purely for the Kindle. So you can buy apps and make purchases within those apps  but you think about Amazon  you look at the trust barometer that I showed you where people are starting to trust businesses  especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments. So suddenly  you start thinking  well Amazon potentially could push this. It could become a natural extension  that as well as buying stuff    take it out of the Kindle    you could buy books  music  real life products  appliances and goods and so on. And suddenly you're getting Amazon  as a brand  is going head to head with the Federal Reserve in terms of how you want to spend your money  what money is  what constitutes money. And I'll get you back to Tide  the detergent now  as I promised. This is a fantastic article I came across in New York Magazine  where it was saying that drug users across America are actually purchasing drugs with bottles of Tide detergent. So they're going into convenience stores  stealing Tide  and a     bottle of Tide is equal to    dollars of crack cocaine or weed. And what they're saying  so some criminologists have looked at this and they're saying  well  okay  Tide as a product sells at a premium. It's    percent above the category average. It's infused with a very complex cocktail of chemicals  so it smells very luxurious and very distinctive  and  being a Procter and Gamble brand  it's been supported by a lot of mass media advertising. So what they're saying is that drug users are consumers too  so they have this in their neural pathways. When they spot Tide  there's a shortcut. They say  that is trust. I trust that. That's quality. So it becomes this unit of currency  which the New York Magazine described as a very oddly loyal crime wave  brand loyal crime wave  and criminals are actually calling Tide  liquid gold.  Now  what I thought was funny was the reaction from the P G spokesperson. They said  obviously tried to dissociate themselves from drugs  but said   It reminds me of one thing and that's the value of the brand has stayed consistent.   Laughter  Which backs up my point and shows he didn't even break a sweat when he said that. So that brings me back to the connection with sweat. In Mexico  Nike has run a campaign recently called  literally  Bid Your Sweat. So you think about  these Nike shoes have got sensors in them  or you're using a Nike FuelBand that basically tracks your movement  your energy  your calorie consumption. And what's happening here  this is where you've actually elected to join that Nike community. You've bought into it. They're not advertising loud messages at you  and that's where advertising has started to shift now is into things like services  tools and applications. So Nike is literally acting as a well being partner  a health and fitness partner and service provider. So what happens with this is they're saying   Right  you have a data dashboard. We know how far you've run  how far you've moved  what your calorie intake  all that sort of stuff. What you can do is  the more you run  the more points you get  and we have an auction where you can buy Nike stuff but only by proving that you've actually used the product to do stuff.  And you can't come into this. This is purely for the community that are sweating using Nike products. You can't buy stuff with pesos. This is literally a closed environment  a closed auction space. In Africa  you know  airtime has become literally a currency in its own right. People are used to  because mobile is king  they're very  very used to transferring money  making payments via mobile. And one of my favorite examples from a brand perspective going on is Vodafone  where  in Egypt  lots of people make purchases in markets and very small independent stores. Loose change  small change is a real problem  and what tends to happen is you buy a bunch of stuff  you're due  say     cents     cents in change. The shopkeepers tend to give you things like an onion or an aspirin  or a piece of gum  because they don't have small change. So when Vodafone came in and saw this problem  this consumer pain point  they created some small change which they call Fakka  which literally sits and is given by the shopkeepers to people  and it's credit that goes straight onto their mobile phone. So this currency becomes credit  which again  is really  really interesting. And we did a survey that backs up the fact that  you know     percent of people in this very crucial demographic in the U.S. were saying that they're comfortable using an independent or branded currency. So that's getting really interesting here  a really interesting dynamic going on. And you think  corporations should start taking their assets and thinking of them in a different way and trading them. And you think  is it much of a leap  It seems farfetched  but when you think about it  in America in       there were       corporations issuing banknotes. There were       kinds of notes in America. And the only thing that stopped that  the government controlled four percent of the supply  and the only thing that stopped it was the Civil War breaking out  and the government suddenly wanted to take control of the money. So government  money  war  nothing changes there  then. So what I'm going to ask is  basically  is history repeating itself  Is technology making paper money feel outmoded  Are we decoupling money from the government  You know  you think about  brands are starting to fill the gaps. Corporations are filling gaps that governments can't afford to fill. So I think  you know  will we be standing on stage buying a coffee    organic  fair trade coffee    next year using TED florins or TED shillings  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  I'm five years old  and I am very proud. My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine. Inside  it's a smelly  gaping hole in the ground  but outside  it's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun. This makes me feel so proud  so important  that I appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and I devise missions for us. So we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free. Four years earlier  when I was one  after the Chernobyl accident  the rain came down black  and my sister's hair fell out in clumps  and I spent nine months in the hospital. There were no visitors allowed  so my mother bribed a hospital worker. She acquired a nurse's uniform  and she snuck in every night to sit by my side. Five years later  an unexpected silver lining. Thanks to Chernobyl  we get asylum in the U.S. I am six years old  and I don't cry when we leave home and we come to America  because I expect it to be a place filled with rare and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate and Bazooka bubble gum  Bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside  Bazooka that we'd get once a year in Ukraine and we'd have to chew one piece for an entire week. So the first day we get to New York  my grandmother and I find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family's staying in. Only  we don't know that it's a homeless shelter. We think that it's a hotel  a hotel with lots of rats. So we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor  and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don't just lose money. And I hold this penny in the palm of my hand  and it's sticky and rusty  but it feels like I'm holding a fortune. I decide that I'm going to get my very own piece of Bazooka bubble gum. And in that moment  I feel like a millionaire. About a year later  I get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash  and suddenly I have more toys than I've ever had in my whole life. And again  I get that feeling when we get a knock on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn  and my sister and I find a deliveryman with a box of pizza that we didn't order. So we take the pizza  our very first pizza  and we devour slice after slice as the deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway. And he tells us to pay  but we don't speak English. My mother comes out  and he asks her for money  but she doesn't have enough. She walks    blocks to and from work every day just to avoid spending money on bus fare. Then our neighbor pops her head in  and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza. Everyone's upset. But the pizza is delicious. It doesn't hit me until years later just how little we had. On our    year anniversary of being in the U.S.  we decided to celebrate by reserving a room at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the U.S. The man at the front desk laughs  and he says   You can't reserve a room here. This is a homeless shelter.  And we were shocked. My husband Brian was also homeless as a kid. His family lost everything  and at age     he had to live in motels with his dad  motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill. And one time  when he finally got his box of Frosted Flakes back  it was crawling with roaches. But he did have one thing. He had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books  two G.I. Joes painted to look like Spider Man and five Gobots. And this was his treasure. This was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams. I'm going to tell you about one more formerly homeless member of our family. This is Scarlett. Once upon a time  Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights. She was tied up and thrown into the ring for other dogs to attack so they'd get more aggressive before the fight. And now  these days  she eats organic food and she sleeps on an orthopedic bed with her name on it  but when we pour water for her in her bowl  she still looks up and she wags her tail in gratitude. Sometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett  and she rolls through the grass  and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude. We forget about all of our new middle class frustrations and disappointments  and we feel like millionaires. Thank you. What do we know about the future  Difficult question  simple answer  nothing. We cannot predict the future. We only can create a vision of the future  how it might be  a vision which reveals disruptive ideas  which is inspiring  and this is the most important reason which breaks the chains of common thinking. There are a lot of people who created their own vision about the future  for instance  this vision here from the early   th century. It says here that this is the ocean plane of the future. It takes only one and a half days to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Today  we know that this future vision didn't come true. So this is our largest airplane which we have  the Airbus A     and it's quite huge  so a lot of people fit in there and it's technically completely different than the vision I've shown to you. I'm working in a team with Airbus  and we have created our vision about a more sustainable future of aviation. So sustainability is quite important for us  which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values. So we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone  or a skeleton  which occurs in nature. So that's why it looks maybe a little bit weird  especially to the people who deal with structures in general. But at least it's just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future. What are the main customers of the future  So  we have the old  we have the young  we have the uprising power of women  and there's one mega trend which affects all of us. These are the future anthropometrics. So our children are getting larger  but at the same time we are growing into different directions. So what we need is space inside the aircraft  inside a very dense area. These people have different needs. So we see a clear need of active health promotion  especially in the case of the old people. We want to be treated as individuals. We like to be productive throughout the entire travel chain  and what we are doing in the future is we want to use the latest man machine interface  and we want to integrate this and show this in one product. So we combined these needs with technology's themes. So for instance  we are asking ourselves  how can we create more light  How can we bring more natural light into the airplane  So this airplane has no windows anymore  for example. What about the data and communication software which we need in the future  My belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness. It will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology. This will be very different in the future. It will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment. And then we are talking also about materials  synthetic biology  for example. And my belief is that we will get more and more new materials which we can put into structure later on  because structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design. So let's compare the old world with the new world. I just want to show you here what we are doing today. So this is a bracket of an A    crew rest compartment. It takes a lot of weight  and it follows the classical design rules. This here is an equal bracket for the same purpose. It follows the design of bone. The design process is completely different. At the one hand  we have  .  kilos  and at the other hand  .  kilos. So this technology   D printing  and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight  which is the biggest issue in aircraft design  because it's directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions. Push this idea a little bit forward. So how does nature build its components and structures  So nature is very clever. It puts all the information into these small building blocks  which we call DNA. And nature builds large skeletons out of it. So we see a bottom up approach here  because all the information  as I said  are inside the DNA. And this is combined with a top down approach  because what we are doing in our daily life is we train our muscles  we train our skeleton  and it's getting stronger. And the same approach can be applied to technology as well. So our building block is carbon nanotubes  for example  to create a large  rivet less skeleton at the end of the day. How this looks in particular  you can show it here. So imagine you have carbon nanotubes growing inside a  D printer  and they are embedded inside a matrix of plastic  and follow the forces which occur in your component. And you've got trillions of them. So you really align them to wood  and you take this wood and make morphological optimization  so you make structures  sub structures  which allows you to transmit electrical energy or data. And now we take this material  combine this with a top down approach  and build bigger and bigger components. So how might the airplane of the future look  So we have very different seats which adapt to the shape of the future passenger  with the different anthropometrics. We have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf. And finally  this bionic structure  which is covered by a transparent biopolymer membrane  will really change radically how we look at aircrafts in the future. So as Jason Silva said  if we can imagine it  why not make it so  See you in the future. Thank you. This is an ambucycle. This is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency. It has everything an ambulance has except for a bed. You see the defibrillator. You see the equipment. We all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston. When I was looking at these pictures  it brought me back many years to my past when I was a child. I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem. When I was six years old  I was walking back from school on a Friday afternoon with my older brother. We were passing by a bus stop. We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes. The bus was on fire  and many people were hurt and killed. I remembered an old man yelling to us and crying to help us get him up. He just needed someone helping him. We were so scared and we just ran away. Growing up  I decided I wanted to become a doctor and save lives. Maybe that was because of what I saw when I was a child. When I was     I took an EMT course  and I went to volunteer on an ambulance. For two years  I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem. I helped many people  but whenever someone really needed help  I never got there in time. We never got there. The traffic is so bad. The distance  and everything. We never got there when somebody really needed us. One day  we received a call about a seven year old child choking from a hot dog. Traffic was horrific  and we were coming from the other side of town in the north part of Jerusalem. When we got there     minutes later  we started CPR on the kid. A doctor comes in from a block away  stop us  checks the kid  and tells us to stop CPR. That second he declared this child dead. At that moment  I understood that this child died for nothing. If this doctor  who lived one block away from there  would have come    minutes earlier  not have to wait until that siren he heard before coming from the ambulance  if he would have heard about it way before  he would have saved this child. He could have run from a block away. He could have saved this child. I said to myself  there must be a better way. Together with    of my friends    we were all EMTs   we decided  let's protect our neighborhood  so when something like that happens again  we will be there running to the scene a lot before the ambulance. So I went over to the manager of the ambulance company and I told him   Please  whenever you have a call coming into our neighborhood  we have    great guys who are willing to stop everything they're doing and run and save lives. Just alert us by beeper. We'll buy these beepers  just tell your dispatch to send us the beeper  and we will run and save lives.  Well  he was laughing. I was    years old. I was a kid. And he said to me   I remember this like yesterday   he was a great guy  but he said to me   Kid  go to school  or go open a falafel stand. We're not really interested in these kinds of new adventures. We're not interested in your help.  And he threw me out of the room.  I don't need your help   he said. I was a very stubborn kid. As you see now  I'm walking around like crazy  meshugenah. So I decided to use the Israeli very famous technique you've probably all heard of  chutzpah.  Laughter  And the next day  I went and I bought two police scanners  and I said   The hell with you  if you don't want to give me information  I'll get the information myself.  And we did turns  who's going to listen to the radio scanners. The next day  while I was listening to the scanners  I heard about a call coming in of a    year old man hurt by a car only one block away from me on the main street of my neighborhood. I ran there by foot. I had no medical equipment. When I got there  the    year old man was lying on the floor  blood was gushing out of his neck. He was on Coumadin. I knew I had to stop his bleeding or else he would die. I took off my yarmulke  because I had no medical equipment  and with a lot of pressure  I stopped his bleeding. He was bleeding from his neck. When the ambulance arrived    minutes later  I gave them over a patient who was alive. When I went to visit him two days later  he gave me a hug and was crying and thanking me for saving his life. At that moment  when I realized this is the first person I ever saved in my life after two years volunteering in an ambulance  I knew this is my life's mission. So today     years later  we have United Hatzalah.  Hatzalah  means  rescue   for all of you who don't know Hebrew. I forgot I'm not in Israel. So we have thousands of volunteers who are passionate about saving lives  and they're spread all around  so whenever a call comes in  they just stop everything and go and run and save a life. Our average response time today went down to less than three minutes in Israel. I'm talking about heart attacks  I'm talking about car accidents  God forbid bomb attacks  shootings  whatever it is  even a woman   o'clock in the morning falling in her home and needs someone to help her. Three minutes  we'll have a guy with his pajamas running to her house and helping her get up. The reasons why we're so successful are because of three things. Thousands of passionate volunteers who will leave everything they do and run to help people they don't even know. We're not there to replace ambulances. We're just there to get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive. And we save people that otherwise would not be saved. The second reason is because of our technology. You know  Israelis are good in technology. Every one of us has on his phone  no matter what kind of phone  a GPS technology done by NowForce  and whenever a call comes in  the closest five volunteers get the call  and they actually get there really quick  and navigated by a traffic navigator to get there and not waste time. And this is a great technology we use all over the country and reduce the response time. And the third thing are these ambucycles. These ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels. We don't transfer people  but we stabilize them  and we save their lives. They never get stuck in traffic. They could even go on a sidewalk. They never  literally  get stuck in traffic. That's why we get there so fast. A few years after I started this organization  in a Jewish community  two Muslims from east Jerusalem called me up. They ask me to meet. They wanted to meet with me. Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan. When Muhammad told me his personal story  how his father     years old  collapsed at home  had a cardiac arrest  and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive  and he saw his father die in front of his eyes  he asked me   Please start this in east Jerusalem.  I said to myself  I saw so much tragedy  so much hate  and it's not about saving Jews. It's not about saving Muslims. It's not about saving Christians. It's about saving people. So I went ahead  full force    and I started United Hatzalah in east Jerusalem  and that's why the names United and Hatzalah match so well. We started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs. Arabs were saving Jews. Jews were saving Arabs. Something special happened. Arabs and Jews  they don't always get along together  but here in this situation  the communities  literally  it's an unbelievable situation that happened  the diversities  all of a sudden they had a common interest  Let's save lives together. Settlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers. It's an unbelievable concept that could work only when you have such a great cause. And these are all volunteers. No one is getting money. They're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives. When my own father collapsed a few years ago from a cardiac arrest  one of the first volunteers to arrive to save my father was one of these Muslim volunteers from east Jerusalem who was in the first course to join Hatzalah. And he saved my father. Could you imagine how I felt in that moment  When I started this organization  I was    years old. I never imagined that one day I'd be speaking at TEDMED. I never even knew what TEDMED was then. I don't think it existed  but I never imagined  I never imagined that it's going to go all around  it's going to spread around  and this last year we started in Panama and Brazil. All I need is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me  passionate about saving lives  and willing to do it. And I'm actually starting it in India very soon with a friend who I met in Harvard just a while back. Hatzalah actually started in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew years before us in Williamsburg  and now it's all over the Jewish community in New York  even Australia and Mexico and many other Jewish communities. But it could spread everywhere. It's very easy to adopt. You even saw these volunteers in New York saving lives in the World Trade Center. Last year alone  we treated in Israel         people. Forty two thousand of them were life threatening situations. And we made a difference. I guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob  and it works. When I look all around here  I see lots of people who would go an extra mile  run an extra mile to save other people  no matter who they are  no matter what religion  no matter who  where they come from. We all want to be heroes. We just need a good idea  motivation and lots of chutzpah  and we could save millions of people that otherwise would not be saved. Thank you very much.   Oedipus Rex     The Lion King     Titus     Frida     The Magic Flute     Across The Universe   Julie Taymor  Thank you. Thank you very much. That's a few samples of the theater  opera and films that I have done over the last    years. But what I'd like to begin with right now is to take you back to a moment that I went through in Indonesia  which is a seminal moment in my life and  like all myths  these stories need to be retold and told  lest we forget them. And when I'm in the turbulent times  as we know  that I am right now  through the crucible and the fire of transformation  which is what all of you do  actually. Anybody who creates knows there's that point where it hasn't quite become the phoenix or the burnt char. And I am right there on the edge  which I'll tell you about  another story. I want to go back to Indonesia where I was about        years  a long time ago  on a fellowship. And I found myself  after two years there and performing and learning  on the island of Bali  on the edge of a crater  Gunung Batur. And I was in a village where there was an initiation ceremony for the young men  a rite of passage. Little did I know that it was mine as well. And as I sat in this temple square under this gigantic beringin banyan tree  in the dark  there was no electricity  just the full moon  down in this empty square  and I heard the most beautiful sounds  like a Charles Ives concert as I listened to the gamelan music from all the different villagers that came for this once every five years ceremony. And I thought I was alone in the dark under this tree. And all of a sudden  out of the dark  from the other end of the square  I saw the glint of mirrors lit by the moon. And these    old men who I'd seen before all of a sudden stood up in these full warrior costumes with the headdress and the spears  and no one was in the square  and I was hidden in the shadows. No one was there  and they came out  and they did this incredible dance.  Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha.  And they moved their bodies and they came forward  and the lights bounced off these costumes. And I've been in theater since I was    years old  and performing  creating  and I went   Who are they performing for with these elaborate costumes  these extraordinary headdresses   And I realized that they were performing for God  whatever that means. But somehow  it didn't matter about the publicity. There was no money involved. It wasn't going to be written down. It was no news. And there were these incredible artists that felt for me like an eternity as they performed. The next moment  as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows  a young man with a propane lantern came on  hung it up on a tree  set up a curtain. The village square was filled with hundreds of people. And they put on an opera all night long. Human beings needed the light. They needed the light to see. So what I gained and gathered from this incredible  seminal moment in my life as a young artist was that you must be true to what you believe as an artist all the way through  but you also have to be aware that the audience is out there in our lives at this time  and they also need the light. And it's this incredible balance that I think that we walk when we are creating something that is breaking ground  that's trying to do something you've never seen before  that imaginary world where you actually don't know where you're going to end up  that's the fine line on the edge of a crater that I have walked my whole life. What I would like to do now is to tell you a little bit about how I work. Let's take  The Lion King.  You saw many examples of my work up there  but it's one that people know. I start with the notion of the ideograph. An ideograph is like a brush painting  a Japanese brush painting. Three strokes  you get the whole bamboo forest. I go to the concept of  The Lion King  and I say   What is the essence of it  What is the abstraction  If I were to reduce this entire story into one image  what would it be   The circle. The circle. It's so obvious. The circle of life. The circle of Mufasa's mask. The circle that  when we come to Act II and there's a drought  how do you express drought  It's a circle of silk on the floor that disappears into the hole in the stage floor. The circle of life comes in the wheels of the gazelles that leap. And you see the mechanics. And being a theater person  what I know and love about the theater is that when the audience comes in and they suspend their disbelief  when you see men walking or women walking with a platter of grass on their heads  you know it's the savanna. You don't question that. I love the apparent truth of theater. I love that people are willing to fill in the blanks. The audience is willing to say   Oh  I know that's not a real sun. You took pieces of sticks. You added silk to the bottom. You suspended these pieces. You let it fall flat on the floor. And as it rises with the strings  I see that it's a sun. But the beauty of it is that it's just silk and sticks. And in a way  that is what makes it spiritual. That's what moves you. It's not the actual literal sunrise that's coming. It's the art of it. So in the theater  as much as the story is critical and the book and the language  the telling of the story  how it's told  the mechanics  the methods that you use  is equal to the story itself. And I'm one who loves high tech and low tech. So I could go from    For instance  I'll show you some  Spider Man  later  these incredible machines that move people along. But the fact is  without the dancer who knows how to use his body and swing on those wires  it's nothing. So now I'm going to show you some clips from the other big project of my life this year   The Tempest.  It's a movie. I did  The Tempest  on a stage three times in the theater since       '    and I love the play. I did it always with a male Prospero. And all of a sudden  I thought   Well  who am I gonna get to play Prospero  Why not Helen Mirren  She's a great actor. Why not   And this material really did work for a woman equally as well. So now  let's take a look at some of the images from  The Tempest.  Ariel  I boarded the king's ship. In every cabin  I flamed amazement. Prospera  At first sight  they have changed eyes. Miranda  Do you love me  Ferdinand  Beyond all limit. HM  They are both in either's powers. Trinculo  Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows. Looking for business  governor  Caliban  Hast thou not dropped from heaven  Stephano  Out of the moon  I do assure thee. Prospera  Caliban  Caliban  This island is mine. Prospera  For this  be sure  tonight thou shalt have cramps. Antonio  Here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon. Sebastian  Draw thy sword. And I  the king  shall love thee. Prospera  I will plague them all  even to roaring. Ariel  I have made you mad. Prospera  We are such stuff as dreams are made on. and our little life is rounded with a sleep. JT  Okay. So I went from theater  doing  The Tempest  on the stage in a very low budget production many years ago  and I love the play  and I also think it's Shakespeare's last play  and it really lends itself  as you can see  to cinema. But I'm just going to give you a little example about how one stages it in theater and then how one takes that same idea or story and moves it into cinema. The ideograph that I talked to you about before  what is it for  The Tempest   What  if I were to boil it down  would be the one image that I could hang my hat on for this  And it was the sand castle  the idea of nurture versus nature  that we build these civilizations    she speaks about it at the end  Helen Mirren's Prospera    we build them  but under nature  under the grand tempest  these cloud capped towers  these gorgeous palaces will fade and there will    leave not a rack behind. So in the theater  I started the play  it was a black sand rake  white cyc  and there was a little girl  Miranda  on the horizon  building a drip castle  a sand castle. And as she was there on the edge of that stage  two stagehands all in black with watering cans ran along the top and started to pour water on the sand castle  and the sand castle started to drip and sink  but before it did  the audience saw the black clad stagehands. The medium was apparent. It was banal. We saw it. But as they started to pour the water  the light changed from showing you the black clad stagehands to focusing  this rough magic that we do in theater  it focused right on the water itself. And all of a sudden  the audience's perspective changes. It becomes something magically large. It becomes the rainstorm. The masked actors  the puppeteers  they disappear  and the audience makes that leap into this world  into this imaginary world of  The Tempest  actually happening. Now the difference when I went and did it in the cinema  I started the actual movie with a close up of a sand castle  a black sand castle  and what cinema can do is  by using camera  perspective  and also long shots and close ups  it started on a close up of the sand castle  and as it pulled away  you saw that it was a miniature sitting in the palm of the girl's hands. And so I could play with the medium  and why I move from one medium to another is to be able to do this. Now I'm going to take you to  Spider Man.  I can soar away from this.   JT  We're trying to do everything in live theater that you can't do in two dimensions in film and television. PP    Rise above yourself and take control.   George Tsypin  We're looking at New York from a Spider Man point of view. Spider Man is not bound by gravity. Manhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either. PP    Be yourself and rise above it all.   Ensemble    Sock  Pow      Slam  Scratch    Danny Ezralow  I don't want you to even think there's a choreographer. It's real  what's happening. I prefer you to see people moving  and you're going   Whoa  what was that   JT  If I give enough movement in the sculpture  and the actor moves their head  you feel like it's alive. It's really comic book live. It's a comic book coming alive. Bono  They're mythologies. They're modern myths  these comic book heroes. PP    They believe.   JT  Ohhhh. What was that  Circus  rock 'n' roll  drama. What the hell are we doing up there on that stage  Well  one last story  very quickly. After I was in that village  I crossed the lake  and I saw that the volcano was erupting on the other side  Gunung Batur  and there was a dead volcano next to the live volcano. I didn't think I'd be swallowed by the volcano  and I am here. But it's very easy to climb up  is it not  You hold on to the roots  you put your foot in the little rocks and climb up there  and you get to the top  and I was with a good friend who was an actor  and we said   Let's go up there. Let's see if we can come close to the edge of that live volcano.  And we climbed up and we got to the very top  and we're on the edge  on this precipice  Roland disappears into the sulfur smoke at the volcano at the other end  and I'm up there alone on this incredible precipice. Did you hear the lyrics  I'm on the precipice looking down into a dead volcano to my left. To my right is sheer shale. It's coming off. I'm in thongs and sarongs. It was many years ago. And no hiking boots. And he's disappeared  this mad French gypsy actor  off in the smoke  and I realize  I can't go back the way that I've come. I can't. So I throw away my camera. I throw away my thongs  and I looked at the line straight in front of me  and I got down on all fours like a cat  and I held with my knees to either side of this line in front of me  for    yards or    feet  I don't know. The wind was massively blowing  and the only way I could get to the other side was to look at the line straight in front of me. I know you've all been there. I'm in the crucible right now. It's my trial by fire. It's my company's trials by fire. We survive because our theme song is  Rise Above.  Boy falls from the sky  rise above. It's right there in the palm of both of our hands  of all of my company's hands. I have beautiful collaborators  and we as creators only get there all together. I know you understand that. And you just stay going forward  and then you see this extraordinary thing in front of your eyes. Thank you. Motor racing is a funny old business. We make a new car every year  and then we spend the rest of the season trying to understand what it is we've built to make it better  to make it faster. And then the next year  we start again. Now  the car you see in front of you is quite complicated. The chassis is made up of about        components  the engine another        the electronics about eight and a half thousand. So there's about        things there that can go wrong. So motor racing is very much about attention to detail. The other thing about Formula   in particular is we're always changing the car. We're always trying to make it faster. So every two weeks  we will be making about       new components to fit to the car. Five to    percent of the race car will be different every two weeks of the year. So how do we do that  Well  we start our life with the racing car. We have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things. On the race car in front of you here there are about     sensors when it goes into a race. It's measuring all sorts of things around the car. That data is logged. We're logging about     different parameters within the data systems  about        health parameters and events to say when things are not working the way they should do  and we're sending that data back to the garage using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second. So during a two hour race  each car will be sending     million numbers. That's twice as many numbers as words that each of us speaks in a lifetime. It's a huge amount of data. But it's not enough just to have data and measure it. You need to be able to do something with it. So we've spent a lot of time and effort in turning the data into stories to be able to tell  what's the state of the engine  how are the tires degrading  what's the situation with fuel consumption  So all of this is taking data and turning it into knowledge that we can act upon. Okay  so let's have a look at a little bit of data. Let's pick a bit of data from another three month old patient. This is a child  and what you're seeing here is real data  and on the far right hand side  where everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic  that is the patient going into cardiac arrest. It was deemed to be an unpredictable event. This was a heart attack that no one could see coming. But when we look at the information there  we can see that things are starting to become a little fuzzy about five minutes or so before the cardiac arrest. We can see small changes in things like the heart rate moving. These were all undetected by normal thresholds which would be applied to data. So the question is  why couldn't we see it  Was this a predictable event  Can we look more at the patterns in the data to be able to do things better  So this is a child  about the same age as the racing car on stage  three months old. It's a patient with a heart problem. Now  when you look at some of the data on the screen above  things like heart rate  pulse  oxygen  respiration rates  they're all unusual for a normal child  but they're quite normal for the child there  and so one of the challenges you have in health care is  how can I look at the patient in front of me  have something which is specific for her  and be able to detect when things start to change  when things start to deteriorate  Because like a racing car  any patient  when things start to go bad  you have a short time to make a difference. So what we did is we took a data system which we run every two weeks of the year in Formula   and we installed it on the hospital computers at Birmingham Children's Hospital. We streamed data from the bedside instruments in their pediatric intensive care so that we could both look at the data in real time and  more importantly  to store the data so that we could start to learn from it. And then  we applied an application on top which would allow us to tease out the patterns in the data in real time so we could see what was happening  so we could determine when things started to change. Now  in motor racing  we're all a little bit ambitious  audacious  a little bit arrogant sometimes  so we decided we would also look at the children as they were being transported to intensive care. Why should we wait until they arrived in the hospital before we started to look  And so we installed a real time link between the ambulance and the hospital  just using normal  G telephony to send that data so that the ambulance became an extra bed in intensive care. And then we started looking at the data. So the wiggly lines at the top  all the colors  this is the normal sort of data you would see on a monitor    heart rate  pulse  oxygen within the blood  and respiration. The lines on the bottom  the blue and the red  these are the interesting ones. The red line is showing an automated version of the early warning score that Birmingham Children's Hospital were already running. They'd been running that since       and already have stopped cardiac arrests and distress within the hospital. The blue line is an indication of when patterns start to change  and immediately  before we even started putting in clinical interpretation  we can see that the data is speaking to us. It's telling us that something is going wrong. The plot with the red and the green blobs  this is plotting different components of the data against each other. The green is us learning what is normal for that child. We call it the cloud of normality. And when things start to change  when conditions start to deteriorate  we move into the red line. There's no rocket science here. It is displaying data that exists already in a different way  to amplify it  to provide cues to the doctors  to the nurses  so they can see what's happening. In the same way that a good racing driver relies on cues to decide when to apply the brakes  when to turn into a corner  we need to help our physicians and our nurses to see when things are starting to go wrong. So we have a very ambitious program. We think that the race is on to do something differently. We are thinking big. It's the right thing to do. We have an approach which  if it's successful  there's no reason why it should stay within a hospital. It can go beyond the walls. With wireless connectivity these days  there is no reason why patients  doctors and nurses always have to be in the same place at the same time. And meanwhile  we'll take our little three month old baby  keep taking it to the track  keeping it safe  and making it faster and better. Thank you very much. I'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before  What is possible with the human voice  What is possible with the human voice    Ooh baby     baby     baby     baby    Baby crying    baby    Baby crying    baby    Cat meowing  Yeah. It was coming straight for me. I had to. It was  yeah. As you can probably well imagine  I was a strange child. Because the thing is  I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be. I was constantly experimenting with these noises. And I'm still on that mission. I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make. And the thing is  I'm a bit older and wiser now  and I know that there's some noises I'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body  and there's things it can't do. And there's things that no one's voice can do. For example  no one can do two notes at the same time. You can do two tone singing  which monks can do  which is like... But that's cheating. And it hurts your throat. So there's things you can't do  and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me  because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world  but they're sketches at best  which is what's annoyed me. If only  if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it. So I've been working with these guys  and we've made a machine. We've made a system which is basically a live production machine  a real time music production machine  and it enables me to  using nothing but my voice  create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me. And I'm going to show you what it can do. And before I start making noises with it  and using it to manipulate my voice  I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice. This system has    thank you  beautiful assistant    this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it  so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind. So once this thing really gets going  and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it  it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice  but it is  so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple. So the polyphony problem  I've only got one voice. How do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time. The simplest way to do it is something like this. By dancing. It's like this. Thanks. So that's probably the easiest way. But if you want to do something a little bit more immediate  something that you can't achieve with live looping  there's other ways to layer your voice up. There's things like pitch shifting  which are awesome  and I'm going to show you now what that sounds like. So I'm going to start another beat for you  like this. There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start  because it's just fun  so you can clap along if you want. You don't have to. It's fine. Check it out. I'm going to lay down a bass sound now. And now  a rockabilly guitar. Which is nice. But what if I want to make  say  a     Applause     Thanks. What if I want to make  say  a rock organ  Is that possible  Yes  it is  by recording myself like this. And now I have that  I have that recorded. Assign it to a keyboard. So that's cool. But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd  Impossible  you say. No. It is possible  and you can do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out. So every noise you can hear there is my voice. I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that. There's no samples. There's no synthesizers. That is literally all my voice being manipulated  and when you get to that point  you have to ask  don't you  what's the point  Why do this   Laughter  Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd  I suppose  is the easy answer. But in actual fact  I haven't made this machine so that I can emulate things that already exist. I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine. So with your permission  I'm going to do some things that are in my mind  and I hope you enjoy them  because they're rather unusual  especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this  it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice  you see. Like this. So  loosely defined  that is what's possible with the human voice. Thank you very much  ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dan Cohen and I am an academic  as he said. And what that means is that I argue. It's an important part of my life. And I like to argue. And I'm not just an academic  I'm a philosopher  so I like to think that I'm actually pretty good at arguing. But I also like to think a lot about arguing. And in thinking about arguing  I've come across some puzzles. And one of the puzzles is that  as I've been thinking about arguing over the years    and it's been decades now    I've gotten better at arguing. But the more that I argue and the better I get at arguing  the more that I lose. And that's a puzzle. And the other puzzle is that I'm actually okay with that. Why is it that I'm okay with losing and why is it that I think good arguers are actually better at losing  Well  there are some other puzzles. One is  why do we argue  Who benefits from arguments  When I think about arguments  I'm talking about    let's call them academic arguments or cognitive arguments    where something cognitive is at stake  Is this proposition true  Is this theory a good theory  Is this a viable interpretation of the data or the text  And so on. I'm not interested really in arguments about whose turn it is to do the dishes or who has to take out the garbage. Yeah  we have those arguments  too. I tend to win those arguments  because I know the tricks. But those aren't the important arguments. I'm interested in academic arguments  and here are the things that puzzle me. First  what do good arguers win when they win an argument  What do I win if I convince you that utilitarianism isn't really the right framework for thinking about ethical theories  What do we win when we win an argument  Even before that  what does it matter to me whether you have this idea that Kant's theory works or Mill is the right ethicist to follow  It's no skin off my back whether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind. So why do we even try to argue  Why do we try to convince other people to believe things they don't want to believe  and is that even a nice thing to do  Is that a nice way to treat another human being  try and make them think something they don't want to think  Well  my answer is going to make reference to three models for arguments. The first model    let's call it the dialectical model    is we think of arguments as war  you know what that's like    a lot of screaming and shouting and winning and losing. That's not a very helpful model for arguing  but it's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing. But there's a second model for arguing  arguments as proofs. Think of a mathematician's argument. Here's my argument. Does it work  Is it any good  Are the premises warranted  Are the inferences valid  Does the conclusion follow from the premises  No opposition  no adversariality    not necessarily any arguing in the adversarial sense. But there's a third model to keep in mind that I think is going to be very helpful  and that is arguments as performances  arguments in front of an audience. We can think of a politician trying to present a position  trying to convince the audience of something. But there's another twist on this model that I really think is important  namely  that when we argue before an audience  sometimes the audience has a more participatory role in the argument  that is  arguments are also  performances  in front of juries  who make a judgment and decide the case. Let's call this the rhetorical model  where you have to tailor your argument to the audience at hand. You know  presenting a sound  well argued  tight argument in English before a francophone audience just isn't going to work. So we have these models    argument as war  argument as proof and argument as performance. Of those three  the argument as war is the dominant one. It dominates how we talk about arguments  it dominates how we think about arguments  and because of that  it shapes how we argue  our actual conduct in arguments. Now  when we talk about arguments  we talk in a very militaristic language. We want strong arguments  arguments that have a lot of punch  arguments that are right on target. We want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order. We want killer arguments. That's the kind of argument we want. It is the dominant way of thinking about arguments. When I'm talking about arguments  that's probably what you thought of  the adversarial model. But the war metaphor  the war paradigm or model for thinking about arguments  has  I think  deforming effects on how we argue. First  it elevates tactics over substance. You can take a class in logic  argumentation. You learn all about the subterfuges that people use to try and win arguments    the false steps. It magnifies the us versus them aspect of it. It makes it adversarial  it's polarizing. And the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph    glorious triumph    or abject  ignominious defeat. I think those are deforming effects  and worst of all  it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation or compromise or collaboration. Think about that one    have you ever entered an argument thinking   Let's see if we can hash something out  rather than fight it out. What can we work out together   I think the argument as war metaphor inhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation. And finally    this is really the worst thing    arguments don't seem to get us anywhere  they're dead ends. They are like roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock in conversation. We don't get anywhere. And one more thing. And as an educator  this is the one that really bothers me  If argument is war  then there's an implicit equation of learning with losing. And let me explain what I mean. Suppose you and I have an argument. You believe a proposition  P  and I don't. And I say   Well  why do you believe P   And you give me your reasons. And I object and say   Well  what about ...   And you answer my objection. And I have a question   Well  what do you mean  How does it apply over here   And you answer my question. Now  suppose at the end of the day  I've objected  I've questioned  I've raised all sorts of counter counter considerations and in every case you've responded to my satisfaction. And so at the end of the day  I say   You know what  I guess you're right  P.  So  I have a new belief. And it's not just any belief  it's well articulated  examined    it's a battle tested belief. Great cognitive gain. OK  who won that argument  Well  the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won  even though I'm the only one who made any cognitive gain. What did you gain  cognitively  from convincing me  Sure  you got some pleasure out of it  maybe your ego stroked  maybe you get some professional status in the field     This guy's a good arguer.  But just from a cognitive point of view  who was the winner  The war metaphor forces us into thinking that you're the winner and I lost  even though I gained. And there's something wrong with that picture. And that's the picture I really want to change if we can. So  how can we find ways to make arguments yield something positive  What we need is new exit strategies for arguments. But we're not going to have new exit strategies for arguments until we have new entry approaches to arguments. We need to think of new kinds of arguments. In order to do that  well    I don't know how to do that. That's the bad news. The argument as war metaphor is just ... it's a monster. It's just taken up habitation in our mind  and there's no magic bullet that's going to kill it. There's no magic wand that's going to make it disappear. I don't have an answer. But I have some suggestions. Here's my suggestion  If we want to think of new kinds of arguments  what we need to do is think of new kinds of arguers. So try this  Think of all the roles that people play in arguments. There's the proponent and the opponent in an adversarial  dialectical argument. There's the audience in rhetorical arguments. There's the reasoner in arguments as proofs. All these different roles. Now  can you imagine an argument in which you are the arguer  but you're also in the audience  watching yourself argue  Can you imagine yourself watching yourself argue  losing the argument  and yet still  at the end of the argument  saying   Wow  that was a good argument   Can you do that  I think you can  and I think if you can imagine that kind of argument  where the loser says to the winner and the audience and the jury can say   Yeah  that was a good argument   then you have imagined a good argument. And more than that  I think you've imagined a good arguer  an arguer that's worthy of the kind of arguer you should try to be. Now  I lose a lot of arguments. It takes practice to become a good arguer  in the sense of being able to benefit from losing  but fortunately  I've had many  many colleagues who have been willing to step up and provide that practice for me. Thank you. In an age of global strife and climate change  I'm here to answer the all important question  Why is sex so damn good  If you're laughing  you know what I mean. Now  before we get to that answer  let me tell you about Chris Hosmer. Chris is a great friend of mine from my university days  but secretly  I hate him. Here's why. Back in university  we had a quick project to design some solar powered clocks. Here's my clock. It uses something called the dwarf sunflower  which grows to about    inches in height. Now  as you know  sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day. So in the morning  you see which direction the sunflower is facing  and you mark it on the blank area in the base. At noon  you mark the changed position of the sunflower  and in the evening again  and that's your clock. Now  I know my clock doesn't tell you the exact time  but it does give you a general idea using a flower. So  in my completely unbiased  subjective opinion  it's brilliant. However  here's Chris' clock. It's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one. In each shot glass is a different scented oil. In the morning  the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass  focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath. This will warm up the scented oil inside  and a particular smell will be emitted. A couple of hours later  the sun will shine on the next magnifying glass  and a different smell will be emitted. So during the course of the day  five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment. Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell. You can see why I hate Chris. I thought my idea was pretty good  but his idea is genius  and at the time  I knew his idea was better than mine  but I just couldn't explain why. One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose. This problem's been bugging me for well over a decade. All right  let's get back to the question of why sex is so good. Many years after the solar powered clocks project  a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses. And when she said this  I had an epiphany. So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses. To do this  I devised something called the five senses graph. Along the y axis  you have a scale from zero to     and along the x axis  you have  of course  the five senses. Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life  I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary. Here's a quick video to show you how it works. and today  I'm going to show you what riding motorbikes is like from the point of view of the five senses. Hey  Bike designer  This is  unclear   custom bike designer.  Sound   Touch   Sight   Smell   Taste  JL  And that's how the five senses graph works. Now  for a period of three years  I gathered data  not just me but also some of my friends  and I used to teach in university  so I forced my    I mean  I asked my students to do this as well. So here are some other results. The first is for instant noodles. Now obviously  taste and smell are quite high  but notice sound is at three. Many people told me a big part of the noodle eating experience is the slurping noise. You know.  Slurps  Needless to say  I no longer dine with these people. Okay  next  clubbing. Okay  here what I found interesting was that taste is at four  and many respondents told me it's because of the taste of drinks  but also  in some cases  kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience. These people I still do hang out with. All right  and smoking. Here I found touch is at  six   and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience  which shows  it's kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers. Okay. Now  what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph  It would  of course  be a horizontal line along the top. Now you can see  not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close. In fact  in the years that I gathered data  only one experience came close to being the perfect one. That is  of course  sex. Great sex. Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level. Here I'll quote one of my students who said   Sex is so good  it's good even when it's bad.  So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good. Now in the middle of all this five senses work  I suddenly remembered the solar powered clocks project from my youth. And I realized this theory also explains why Chris' clock is so much better than mine. You see  my clock only focuses on sight  and a little bit of touch. Here's Chris' clock. It's the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time. In fact  in terms of the five senses  Chris' clock is a revolution. And that's what this theory taught me about my field. You see  up till now  us designers  we've mainly focused on making things look very pretty  and a little bit of touch  which means we've ignored the other three senses. Chris' clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product. So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs  Here's three quick ideas I came up with. This is an iron  you know  for your clothes  to which I added a spraying mechanism  so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent  and your clothes will smell nicer  but hopefully it should also make the ironing experience more enjoyable. We could call this  the perfumator.  All right  next. So I brush my teeth twice a day  and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy  and when the taste of candy ran out  you'd know it's time to change your toothbrush  Finally  I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet. It's not just the way they look  but I love the way they feel when you press down on them. Now  I don't play the flute or the clarinet  so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play  the television remote control. Now  when we look at these three ideas together  you'll notice that the five senses theory doesn't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look. So in conclusion  I've found the five senses theory to be a very useful tool in evaluating different experiences in my life  and then taking those best experiences and hopefully incorporating them into my designs. Now  I realize the five senses isn't the only thing that makes life interesting. There's also the six emotions and that elusive x factor. Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk. Until then  please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs. Oh  one last thing before I leave. Here's the experience you all had while listening to the TED Talks. However  it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses like smell and taste. And the best way to do that is with free candy. You guys ready  All right. I moved back home    years ago after a    year stay in the United States  and Africa called me back. And I founded my country's first graphic design and new media college. And I called it the Zimbabwe Institute of Vigital Arts. The idea  the dream  was really for a sort of Bauhaus sort of school where new ideas were interrogated and investigated  the creation of a new visual language based on the African creative heritage. We offer a two year diploma to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education. And typography's a very important part of the curriculum and we encourage our students to look inward for influence. Here's a poster designed by one of the students under the theme  Education is a right.  Some logos designed by my students. Africa has had a long tradition of writing  but this is not such a well known fact  and I wrote the book  Afrikan Alphabets  to address that. The different types of writing in Africa  first was proto writing  as illustrated by Nsibidi  which is the writing system of a secret society of the Ejagham people in southern Nigeria. So it's a special interest writing system. The Akan of people of Ghana and  Cote d'Ivoire  developed Adinkra symbols some     years ago  and these are proverbs  historical sayings  objects  animals  plants  and my favorite Adinkra system is the first one at the top on the left. It's called Sankofa. It means   Return and get it.  Learn from the past. This pictograph by the Jokwe people of Angola tells the story of the creation of the world. At the top is God  at the bottom is man  mankind  and on the left is the sun  on the right is the moon. All the paths lead to and from God. These secret societies of the Yoruba  Kongo and Palo religions in Nigeria  Congo and Angola respectively  developed this intricate writing system which is alive and well today in the New World in Cuba  Brazil and Trinidad and Haiti. In the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo  in the Ituri society  the men pound out a cloth out of a special tree  and the women  who are also the praise singers  paint interweaving patterns that are the same in structure as the polyphonic structures that they use in their singing    a sort of a musical score  if you may. In South Africa  Ndebele women use these symbols and other geometric patterns to paint their homes in bright colors  and the Zulu women use the symbols in the beads that they weave into bracelets and necklaces. Ethiopia has had the longest tradition of writing  with the Ethiopic script that was developed in the fourth century A.D. and is used to write Amharic  which is spoken by over    million people. King Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum Kingdom of Cameroon developed Sh  mom at the age of   . Sh  mom is a writing system. It's a syllabary. It's not exactly an alphabet. And here we see three stages of development that it went through in    years. The Vai people of Liberia had a long tradition of literacy before their first contact with Europeans in the     s. It's a syllabary and reads from left to right. Next door  in Sierra Leone  the Mende also developed a syllabary  but theirs reads from right to left. Africa has had a long tradition of design  a well defined design sensibility  but the problem in Africa has been that  especially today  designers in Africa struggle with all forms of design because they are more apt to look outward for influence and inspiration. The creative spirit in Africa  the creative tradition  is as potent as it has always been  if only designers could look within. This Ethiopic cross illustrates what Dr. Ron Eglash has established  that Africa has a lot to contribute to computing and mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals. Africans of antiquity created civilization  and their monuments  which still stand today  are a true testimony of their greatness. Most probably  one of humanity's greatest achievements is the invention of the alphabet  and that has been attributed to Mesopotamia with their invention of cuneiform in      BC  followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt  and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact. That is  until       when one Yale professor John Coleman Darnell discovered these inscriptions in the Thebes desert on the limestone cliffs in western Egypt  and these have been dated at between      and      B.C.  centuries before Mesopotamia. Called Wadi el Hol because of the place that they were discovered  these inscriptions    research is still going on  a few of them have been deciphered  but there is consensus among scholars that this is really humanity's first alphabet. Over here  you see a paleographic chart that shows what has been deciphered so far  starting with the letter A    lep   at the top  and  b t   in the middle  and so forth. It is time that students of design in Africa read the works of titans like Cheikh Anta Diop  Senegal's Cheikh Anta Diop  whose seminal work on Egypt is vindicated by this discovery. The last word goes to the great Jamaican leader Marcus Mosiah Garvey and the Akan people of Ghana with their Adinkra symbol Sankofa  which encourages us to go to the past so as to inform our present and build on a future for us and our children. It is also time that designers in Africa stop looking outside. They've been looking outward for a long time  yet what they were looking for has been right there within grasp  right within them. Thank you very much. The day I left home for the first time to go to university was a bright day brimming with hope and optimism. I'd done well at school. Expectations for me were high  and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures  parties and traffic cone theft. Now appearances  of course  can be deceptive  and to an extent  this feisty  energetic persona of lecture going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer  albeit a very well crafted and convincing one. Underneath  I was actually deeply unhappy  insecure and fundamentally frightened    frightened of other people  of the future  of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me. But I was skilled at hiding it  and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and aspire to. This fantasy of invulnerability was so complete that I even deceived myself  and as the first semester ended and the second began  there was no way that anyone could have predicted what was just about to happen. I was leaving a seminar when it started  humming to myself  fumbling with my bag just as I'd done a hundred times before  when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe   She is leaving the room.  I looked around  and there was no one there  but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable. Shaken  I left my books on the stairs and hurried home  and there it was again.  She is opening the door.  This was the beginning. The voice had arrived. And the voice persisted  days and then weeks of it  on and on  narrating everything I did in the third person.  She is going to the library.   She is going to a lecture.  It was neutral  impassive and even  after a while  strangely companionate and reassuring  although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion. So  for example  if I was angry and had to hide it  which I often did  being very adept at concealing how I really felt  then the voice would sound frustrated. Otherwise  it was neither sinister nor disturbing  although even at that point it was clear that it had something to communicate to me about my emotions  particularly emotions which were remote and inaccessible. Now it was then that I made a fatal mistake  in that I told a friend about the voice  and she was horrified. A subtle conditioning process had begun  the implication that normal people don't hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong. Such fear and mistrust was infectious. Suddenly the voice didn't seem quite so benign anymore  and when she insisted that I seek medical attention  I duly complied  and which proved to be mistake number two. I spent some time telling the college G.P. about what I perceived to be the real problem  anxiety  low self worth  fears about the future  and was met with bored indifference until I mentioned the voice  upon which he dropped his pen  swung round and began to question me with a show of real interest. And to be fair  I was desperate for interest and help  and I began to tell him about my strange commentator. And I always wish  at this point  the voice had said   She is digging her own grave.  I was referred to a psychiatrist  who likewise took a grim view of the voice's presence  subsequently interpreting everything I said through a lens of latent insanity. For example  I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus  and during an appointment which was running very late  I said   I'm sorry  doctor  I've got to go. I'm reading the news at six.  Now it's down on my medical records that Eleanor has delusions that she's a television news broadcaster. It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me. A hospital admission followed  the first of many  a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next  and then  worst of all  a toxic  tormenting sense of hopelessness  humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects. But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom  my fear and resistance towards it intensified. Now essentially  this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind  a kind of psychic civil war  and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing. Helplessly and hopelessly  I began to retreat into this nightmarish inner world in which the voices were destined to become both my persecutors and my only perceived companions. They told me  for example  that if I proved myself worthy of their help  then they could change my life back to how it had been  and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set  a kind of labor of Hercules. It started off quite small  for example  pull out three strands of hair  but gradually it grew more extreme  culminating in commands to harm myself  and a particularly dramatic instruction   You see that tutor over there  You see that glass of water  Well  you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students.  Which I actually did  and which needless to say did not endear me to the faculty. In effect  a vicious cycle of fear  avoidance  mistrust and misunderstanding had been established  and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation. Two years later  and the deterioration was dramatic. By now  I had the whole frenzied repertoire  terrifying voices  grotesque visions  bizarre  intractable delusions. My mental health status had been a catalyst for discrimination  verbal abuse  and physical and sexual assault  and I'd been told by my psychiatrist   Eleanor  you'd be better off with cancer  because cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia.  I'd been diagnosed  drugged and discarded  and was by now so tormented by the voices that I attempted to drill a hole in my head in order to get them out. Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years  it seems to me now as if someone died in that place  and yet  someone else was saved. A broken and haunted person began that journey  but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be. Many people have harmed me in my life  and I remember them all  but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who've helped me. The fellow survivors  the fellow voice hearers  the comrades and collaborators  the mother who never gave up on me  who knew that one day I would come back to her and was willing to wait for me for as long as it took  the doctor who only worked with me for a brief time but who reinforced his belief that recovery was not only possible but inevitable  and during a devastating period of relapse told my terrified family   Don't give up hope. I believe that Eleanor can get through this. Sometimes  you know  it snows as late as May  but summer always comes eventually.  Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized  lonely place. But together  they forged a blend of courage  creativity  integrity  and an unshakeable belief that my shattered self could become healed and whole. I used to say that these people saved me  but what I now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself  and crucially  they helped me to understand something which I'd always suspected  that my voices were a meaningful response to traumatic life events  particularly childhood events  and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into solvable emotional problems. Now  at first  this was very difficult to believe  not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing  so in this respect  a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth. So for example  voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world  rather than an actual  objective danger. Now at first  I would have believed them. I remember  for example  sitting up one night on guard outside my parents' room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices. Because I'd had such a bad problem with self injury that most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden  so I ended up arming myself with a plastic fork  kind of like picnic ware  and sort of sat outside the room clutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen. It was like   Don't mess with me. I've got a plastic fork  don't you know   Strategic. But a later response  and much more useful  would be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words  so when the voices warned me not to leave the house  then I would thank them for drawing my attention to how unsafe I felt    because if I was aware of it  then I could do something positive about it    but go on to reassure both them and myself that we were safe and didn't need to feel frightened anymore. I would set boundaries for the voices  and try to interact with them in a way that was assertive yet respectful  establishing a slow process of communication and collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another. Throughout all of this  what I would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself  and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had an opportunity to process or resolve  memories of sexual trauma and abuse  of anger  shame  guilt  low self worth. The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it  and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly  and as such  it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care. It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self  each fragment represented by a different voice  gradually withdraw from all my medication  and return to psychiatry  only this time from the other side. Ten years after the voice first came  I finally graduated  this time with the highest degree in psychology the university had ever given  and one year later  the highest masters  which shall we say isn't bad for a madwoman. In fact  one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam  which technically possibly counts as cheating. And to be honest  sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well. As Oscar Wilde has said  the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. It also makes you very good at eavesdropping  because you can listen to two conversations simultaneously. So it's not all bad. I worked in mental health services  I spoke at conferences  I published book chapters and academic articles  and I argued  and continue to do so  the relevance of the following concept  that an important question in psychiatry shouldn't be what's wrong with you but rather what's happened to you. And all the while  I listened to my voices  with whom I'd finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn reflected a growing sense of compassion  acceptance and respect towards myself. And I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment when supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices  and becoming fully aware  for the very first time  that I no longer felt that way myself but was finally able to help someone else who was. I'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice  the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement  an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher  which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy  a sane reaction to insane circumstances  not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured  but a complex  significant and meaningful experience to be explored. Together  we envisage and enact a society that understands and respects voice hearing  supports the needs of individuals who hear voices  and which values them as full citizens. This type of society is not only possible  it's already on its way. To paraphrase Chavez  once social change begins  it cannot be reversed. You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride. You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore. For me  the achievements of the Hearing Voices Movement are a reminder that empathy  fellowship  justice and respect are more than words  they are convictions and beliefs  and that beliefs can change the world. In the last    years  the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in    countries across five continents  working together to promote dignity  solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress  to create a new language and practice of hope  which  at its very center  lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual. As Peter Levine has said  the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity. In this respect  for members of society  there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone  to bear witness  to reach out a hand  to share the burden of someone's suffering  and to hold the hope for their recovery. And likewise  for survivors of distress and adversity  that we remember we don't have to live our lives forever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us. We are unique. We are irreplaceable. What lies within us can never be truly colonized  contorted  or taken away. The light never goes out. As a very wonderful doctor once said to me   Don't tell me what other people have told you about yourself. Tell me about you.  Thank you. Adam Ockelford  I promise there won't be too much of me talking  and a lot of Derek playing  but I thought it would just be nice to recap on how Derek got to where he is today. It's amazing now  because he's so much bigger than me  but when Derek was born  he could have fitted on the palm of your hand. He was born three and a half months premature  and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive. He had to have a lot of oxygen  and that affected your eyes  Derek  and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world. But that was the end of the bad news  because when Derek came home from the hospital  his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you  Derek  really for the rest of your childhood. And Nanny's great insight  really  was to think  here's a child who can't see. Music must be the thing for Derek. And sure enough  she sang  or as Derek called it  warbled  to him for his first few years of life. And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe  you know  in his brain something was stirring  some sort of musical gift. Here's a little picture of Derek going up now  when you were with your nanny. Now Nanny's great other insight was to think  perhaps we should get Derek something to play  and sure enough  she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft  never thinking really that anything much would come of it. But Derek  your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it  bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break. But out of all the bashing  after a few months  emerged the most fantastic music  and I think there was just a miracle moment  really  Derek  when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard. That was the great eureka moment. Now  not being able to see meant  of course  that you taught yourself. Derek Paravicini  I taught myself to play. AO  You did teach yourself to play  and as a consequence  playing the piano for you  Derek  was a lot of knuckles and karate chops  and even a bit of nose going on in there. And now  here's what Nanny did also do was to press the record button on one of those little early tape recorders that they had  and this is a wonderful tape  now  of Derek playing when you were four years old. DP   Molly Malone  Cockles and Mussels .  AO  It wasn't actually  Cockles and Mussels.  This one is  English Country Garden.  DP   English Country Garden.  AO  There you are. I think that's just fantastic. You know  there's this little child who can't see  can't really understand much about the world  has no one in the family who plays an instrument  and yet he taught himself to play that. And as you can see from the picture  there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing  Derek. Now  along    Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old  and at first  Derek  I thought you were mad  to be honest  because when you played the piano  you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard  and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way. So as soon as I tried to get near the piano  I was firmly shoved off. And having said to your dad  Nic  that I would try to teach you  I was then slightly confused as to how I might go about that if I wasn't allowed near the piano. But after a while  I thought  well  the only way is to just pick you up  shove Derek over to the other side of the room  and in the    seconds that I got before Derek came back  I could just play something very quickly for him to learn. And in the end  Derek  I think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together. As you can see  there's me in my early  pre marriage days with a brown beard  and little Derek concentrating there. I just realized this is going to be recorded  isn't it  Right. Okay. Now then  by the age of     Derek really had taken the world by storm. This is a photo of you  Derek  playing at the Barbican with the Royal Philharmonic Pops. Basically it was just an exciting journey  really. And in those days  Derek  you didn't speak very much  and so there was always a moment of tension as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key  and all that kind of thing. But the orchestra were wowed as well  and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability to play these fantastic pieces. Now the question is  how do you do it  Derek  And hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do. I think that one of the first things that happened when you were very little  Derek  was that by the time you were two  your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults. And so whenever you heard any note at all    if I just play a random note    you knew instantly what it was  and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano. Now that's called perfect pitch  and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano. You can see how    you get a sense of playing with Derek. But Derek  your ear is so much more than that. If I just put the microphone down for a bit  I'm going to play a cluster of notes. Those of you who can see will know how many notes  but Derek  of course  can't. Not only can you say how many notes  it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are. Well  forget the terminology  Derek. Fantastic. And it's that ability  that ability to hear simultaneous sounds  not only just single sounds  but when a whole orchestra is playing  Derek  you can hear every note  and instantly  through all those hours and hours of practice  reproduce those on the keyboard  that makes you  I think  is the basis of all your ability. Now then. It's no use having that kind of raw ability without the technique  and luckily  Derek  you decided that  once we did start learning  you'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings. So for example using your thumb under with C major. Etc. And in the end  you got so quick  that things like  Flight of the Bumblebee  were no problem  were they  DP  No. AO  Right. So here  by the age of     Derek was playing things like this. DP  This. AO  Derek  let's have a bow. Well done. Now the truly amazing thing was  with all those scales  Derek  you could not only play  Flight of the Bumblebee  in the usual key  but any note I play  Derek can play it on. So if I just choose a note at random  like that one. Can you play  Flight of the Bumblebee  on that note  DP   Flight of the Bumblebee  on that note. AO  Or another one  How about in G minor  DP  G minor. AO  Fantastic. Well done  Derek. So you see  in your brain  Derek  is this amazing musical computer that can instantly recalibrate  recalculate  all the pieces in the world that are out there. Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said   Sorry  do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee' in B minor instead of A minor   as we went on. In fact  the first time  Derek  you played that with an orchestra  you'd learned the version that you'd learned  and then the orchestra  in fact  did have a different version  so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert  Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra. Fantastic chap. The other wonderful thing about you is memory. DP  Memory. AO  Your memory is truly amazing  and every concert we do  we ask the audience to participate  of course  by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play. And people say   Well  that's terribly brave because what happens if Derek doesn't know it   And I say   No  it's not brave at all  because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know  you're invited to come and sing it first  and then he'll pick it up.   Laughter  So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish. But seriously  would anyone like to choose a piece  DP  Choose a piece. Choose  choose  would you like to choose  AO  Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out. Would you like to hear me play  AO  Paganini. DP   The Theme of Paganini.  AO  Well done. Derek's going to L.A. soon  and it's a milestone  because it means that Derek and I will have spent over     hours on long haul flights together  which is quite interesting  isn't it Derek  DP  Very interesting  Adam  yes. Long haul flights. Yes. AO  You may think    hours is a long time to keep talking  but Derek does it effortlessly. Now then. But in America  they've coined this term   the human iPod  for Derek  which I think is just missing the point  really  because Derek  you're so much more than an iPod. You're a fantastic  creative musician  and I think that was nowhere clearer to see  really  than when we went to Slovenia  and someone    in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in  and this person  very  very nervously came onto the stage. DP  He played  Chopsticks.  AO  And played  Chopsticks.  DP   Chopsticks.  AO  A bit like this. DP  Like this. Yes. AO  I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it. He's sitting there. DP  Somebody played  Chopsticks  like this. AO  Just teasing  right  Here we go. DP  Let Derek play it. AO  What did you do with it  Derek  DP  I got to improvise with it  Adam. AO  This is Derek the musician. Keep up with Derek. The TED people will kill me  but perhaps there's time for one encore. DP  For one encore. AO  One encore  yes. So this is one of Derek's heroes. It's the great Art Tatum    DP  Art Tatum. AO     who also was a pianist who couldn't see  and also  I think  like Derek  thought that all the world was a piano  so whenever Art Tatum plays something  it sounds like there's three pianos in the room. And here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on  Tiger Rag.  DP   Tiger Rag.  In the northwest corner of the United States  right up near the Canadian border  there's a little town called Libby  Montana  and it's surrounded by pine trees and lakes and just amazing wildlife and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky. And in there is a little town called Libby  which I visited  which feels kind of lonely  a little isolated. And in Libby  Montana  there's a rather unusual woman named Gayla Benefield. She always felt a little bit of an outsider  although she's been there almost all her life  a woman of Russian extraction. She told me when she went to school  she was the only girl who ever chose to do mechanical drawing. Later in life  she got a job going house to house reading utility meters    gas meters  electricity meters. And she was doing the work in the middle of the day  and one thing particularly caught her notice  which was  in the middle of the day she met a lot of men who were at home  middle aged  late middle aged  and a lot of them seemed to be on oxygen tanks. It struck her as strange. Then  a few years later  her father died at the age of     five days before he was due to receive his pension. He'd been a miner. She thought he must just have been worn out by the work. But then a few years later  her mother died  and that seemed stranger still  because her mother came from a long line of people who just seemed to live forever. In fact  Gayla's uncle is still alive to this day  and learning how to waltz. It didn't make sense that Gayla's mother should die so young. It was an anomaly  and she kept puzzling over anomalies. And as she did  other ones came to mind. She remembered  for example  when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital  and she had a lot of x rays  and two of them were leg x rays  which made sense  but six of them were chest x rays  which didn't. She puzzled and puzzled over every piece of her life and her parents' life  trying to understand what she was seeing. She thought about her town. The town had a vermiculite mine in it. Vermiculite was used for soil conditioners  to make plants grow faster and better. Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts  huge amounts of it put under the roof to keep houses warm during the long Montana winters. Vermiculite was in the playground. It was in the football ground. It was in the skating rink. What she didn't learn until she started working this problem is vermiculite is a very toxic form of asbestos. When she figured out the puzzle  she started telling everyone she could what had happened  what had been done to her parents and to the people that she saw on oxygen tanks at home in the afternoons. But she was really amazed. She thought  when everybody knows  they'll want to do something  but actually nobody wanted to know. In fact  she became so annoying as she kept insisting on telling this story to her neighbors  to her friends  to other people in the community  that eventually a bunch of them got together and they made a bumper sticker  which they proudly displayed on their cars  which said   Yes  I'm from Libby  Montana  and no  I don't have asbestosis.  But Gayla didn't stop. She kept doing research. The advent of the Internet definitely helped her. She talked to anybody she could. She argued and argued  and finally she struck lucky when a researcher came through town studying the history of mines in the area  and she told him her story  and at first  of course  like everyone  he didn't believe her  but he went back to Seattle and he did his own research and he realized that she was right. So now she had an ally. Nevertheless  people still didn't want to know. They said things like   Well  if it were really dangerous  someone would have told us.   If that's really why everyone was dying  the doctors would have told us.  Some of the guys used to very heavy jobs said   I don't want to be a victim. I can't possibly be a victim  and anyway  every industry has its accidents.  But still Gayla went on  and finally she succeeded in getting a federal agency to come to town and to screen the inhabitants of the town           people    and what they discovered was that the town had a mortality rate    times higher than anywhere in the United States. That was in       and even at that moment  no one raised their hand to say   Gayla  look in the playground where your grandchildren are playing. It's lined with vermiculite.  This wasn't ignorance. It was willful blindness. Willful blindness is a legal concept which means  if there's information that you could know and you should know but you somehow manage not to know  the law deems that you're willfully blind. You have chosen not to know. There's a lot of willful blindness around these days. You can see willful blindness in banks  when thousands of people sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them. You could see them in banks when interest rates were manipulated and everyone around knew what was going on  but everyone studiously ignored it. You can see willful blindness in the Catholic Church  where decades of child abuse went ignored. You could see willful blindness in the run up to the Iraq War. Willful blindness exists on epic scales like those  and it also exists on very small scales  in people's families  in people's homes and communities  and particularly in organizations and institutions. Companies that have been studied for willful blindness can be asked questions like   Are there issues at work that people are afraid to raise   And when academics have done studies like this of corporations in the United States  what they find is    percent of people say yes. Eighty five percent of people know there's a problem  but they won't say anything. And when I duplicated the research in Europe  asking all the same questions  I found exactly the same number. Eighty five percent. That's a lot of silence. It's a lot of blindness. And what's really interesting is that when I go to companies in Switzerland  they tell me   This is a uniquely Swiss problem.  And when I go to Germany  they say   Oh yes  this is the German disease.  And when I go to companies in England  they say   Oh  yeah  the British are really bad at this.  And the truth is  this is a human problem. We're all  under certain circumstances  willfully blind. What the research shows is that some people are blind out of fear. They're afraid of retaliation. And some people are blind because they think  well  seeing anything is just futile. Nothing's ever going to change. If we make a protest  if we protest against the Iraq War  nothing changes  so why bother  Better not to see this stuff at all. And the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time is people say   Well  you know  the people who do see  they're whistleblowers  and we all know what happens to them.  So there's this profound mythology around whistleblowers which says  first of all  they're all crazy. But what I've found going around the world and talking to whistleblowers is  actually  they're very loyal and quite often very conservative people. They're hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for  and the reason that they speak up  the reason they insist on seeing  is because they care so much about the institution and want to keep it healthy. And the other thing that people often say about whistleblowers is   Well  there's no point  because you see what happens to them. They are crushed. Nobody would want to go through something like that.  And yet  when I talk to whistleblowers  the recurrent tone that I hear is pride. I think of Joe Darby. We all remember the photographs of Abu Ghraib  which so shocked the world and showed the kind of war that was being fought in Iraq. But I wonder who remembers Joe Darby  the very obedient  good soldier who found those photographs and handed them in. And he said   You know  I'm not the kind of guy to rat people out  but some things just cross the line. Ignorance is bliss  they say  but you can't put up with things like this.  I talked to Steve Bolsin  a British doctor  who fought for five years to draw attention to a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies. And I asked him why he did it  and he said   Well  it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it. She came up to me one night  and she just said  'Dad  you can't let the kids die.'  Or I think of Cynthia Thomas  a really loyal army daughter and army wife  who  as she saw her friends and relations coming back from the Iraq War  was so shocked by their mental condition and the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge post traumatic stress syndrome that she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town to give them legal  psychological and medical assistance. And she said to me  she said   You know  Margaret  I always used to say I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grow up. But I've found myself in this cause  and I'll never be the same.  We all enjoy so many freedoms today  hard won freedoms  the freedom to write and publish without fear of censorship  a freedom that wasn't here the last time I came to Hungary  a freedom to vote  which women in particular had to fight so hard for  the freedom for people of different ethnicities and cultures and sexual orientation to live the way that they want. But freedom doesn't exist if you don't use it  and what whistleblowers do  and what people like Gayla Benefield do is they use the freedom that they have. And what they're very prepared to do is recognize that yes  this is going to be an argument  and yes I'm going to have a lot of rows with my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends  but I'm going to become very good at this conflict. I'm going to take on the naysayers  because they'll make my argument better and stronger. I can collaborate with my opponents to become better at what I do. These are people of immense persistence  incredible patience  and an absolute determination not to be blind and not to be silent. When I went to Libby  Montana  I visited the asbestosis clinic that Gayla Benefield brought into being  a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went in the back door because they didn't want to acknowledge that she'd been right. I sat in a diner  and I watched as trucks drove up and down the highway  carting away the earth out of gardens and replacing it with fresh  uncontaminated soil. I took my    year old daughter with me  because I really wanted her to meet Gayla. And she said   Why  What's the big deal   I said   She's not a movie star  and she's not a celebrity  and she's not an expert  and Gayla's the first person who'd say she's not a saint. The really important thing about Gayla is she is ordinary. She's like you  and she's like me. She had freedom  and she was ready to use it.  Thank you very much. Hi. I am an architect. I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube  and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes.       much  much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues  I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure. It's very complicated to test the new material for the building  but this is much stronger than I expected  and also it's very easy to waterproof  and also  because it's industrial material  it's also possible to fireproof. Then I built the temporary structure      . This is the first temporary building made out of paper. There are     tubes  diameter     centimeters   there are only    tubes with a diameter of     centimeters  or four feet  wide. As you see it in the photo  inside is the toilet. In case you're finished with toilet paper  you can tear off the inside of the wall.  Laughter  So it's very useful. Year       there was a big expo in Germany. I was asked to design the building  because the theme of the expo was environmental issues. So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes  recyclable paper. My goal of the design is not when it's completed. My goal was when the building was demolished  because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year  we create a lot of industrial waste  so my building has to be reused or recycled. After  the building was recycled. So that was the goal of my design. Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz. Because I was so poor  I wanted to rent an office in Paris  but I couldn't afford it  so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves. So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the    meter long office. We stayed there for six years without paying any rent. Thank you. I had one big problem. Because we were part of the exhibition  even if my friend wanted to see me  they had to buy a ticket to see me. That was the problem. Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz. It's a very popular museum now  and I created a big monument for the government. But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect  because we are not helping  we are not working for society  but we are working for privileged people  rich people  government  developers. They have money and power. Those are invisible. So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture. That is our profession  even historically it's the same  even now we are doing the same. So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society  even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters. But I must say they are no longer natural disasters. For example  earthquakes never kill people  but collapse of the buildings kill people. That's the responsibility of architects. Then people need some temporary housing  but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people. So I thought  even as architects  we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing. We can make it better. So that is why I started working in disaster areas.       there was a big disaster in Rwanda  Africa. Two tribes  Hutu and Tutsi  fought each other. Over two million people became refugees. But I was so surprised to see the shelter  refugee camp organized by the U.N. They're so poor  and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season  In the shelters built by the U.N.  they were just providing a plastic sheet  and the refugees had to cut the trees  and just like this. But over two million people cut trees. It just became big  heavy deforestation and an environmental problem. That is why they started providing aluminum pipes  aluminum barracks. Very expensive  they throw them out for money  then cutting trees again. So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong  but my budget is only    U.S. dollars per unit. We built    units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites  so on. And then  year afterward        in Kobe  Japan  we had a big earthquake. Nearly       people were killed  and the city like this Nagata district  all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake. And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church    all the building was totally destroyed. So I went there and also I proposed to the priests   Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes   And he said   Oh God  are you crazy  After a fire  what are you proposing   So he never trusted me  but I didn't give up. I started commuting to Kobe  and I met the society of Vietnamese people. They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park. So I proposed to rebuild. I raised    did fundraising. I made a paper tube shelter for them  and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish  I used beer crates as a foundation. I asked the Kirin beer company to propose  because at that time  the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red  which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes. The color coordination is very important. And also I still remember  we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate  but it came empty.  Laughter  So I remember it was so disappointing. So during the summer with my students  we built over    units of the shelters. Finally the priest  finally he trusted me to rebuild. He said   As long as you collect money by yourself  bring your students to build  you can do it.  So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church. It was meant to stay there for three years  but actually it stayed there    years because people loved it. Then  in Taiwan  they had a big earthquake  and we proposed to donate this church  so we dismantled them  we sent them over to be built by volunteer people. It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now. So this building became a permanent building. Then I wonder  what is a permanent and what is a temporary building  Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it. Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money. In       in Turkey  the big earthquake  I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.       in West India  I built also a shelter. In       in Sri Lanka  after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami  I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages. And in       in Chengdu  Sichuan area in China  nearly        people were killed  and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor. I was asked to rebuild the temporary church. I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students. In one month  we completed nine classrooms  over     square meters. It's still used  even after the current earthquake in China. In       in Italy  L'Aquila  also they had a big earthquake. And this is a very interesting photo  former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso    you know  because we have to change the prime minister ever year. And they are very kind  affording my model. I proposed a big rebuilding  a temporary music hall  because L'Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed  so musicians were moving out. So I proposed to the mayor  I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium. He said   As long as you bring your money  you can do it.  And I was very lucky. Mr. Berlusconi brought G  summit  and our former prime minister came  so they helped us to collect money  and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium. Year      in Haiti  there was a big earthquake  but it's impossible to fly over  so I went to Santo Domingo  next door country  to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build    units of shelter out of local paper tubes. This is what happened in Japan two years ago  in northern Japan. After the earthquake and tsunami  people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium. But look at this. There's no privacy. People suffer mentally and physically. So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes  just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain. However  some of the facility authority doesn't want us to do it  because  they said  simply  it's become more difficult to control them. But it's really necessary to do it. They don't have enough flat area to build standard government single story housing like this one. Look at this. Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing  so dense and so messy because there is no storage  nothing  water is leaking  so I thought  we have to make multi story building because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable. So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions. Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi. He asked me to build three story housing on baseball  fields . I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable  within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same  but much more comfortable. Many of the people want to stay here forever. I was very happy to hear that. Now I am working in New Zealand  Christchurch. About    days before the Japanese earthquake happened  also they had a big earthquake  and many Japanese students were also killed  and the most important cathedral of the city  the symbol of Christchurch  was totally destroyed. And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral. So this is under construction. And I'd like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  What I'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects  and that is the neuroscience of sleep. Now  there is a sound    Ah  it worked  A sound that is desperately familiar to most of us  and of course it's the sound of the alarm clock. And what that truly ghastly  awful sound does is stop the single most important behavioral experience that we have  and that's sleep. If you're an average sort of person     percent of your life will be spent asleep  which means that if you live to     then    years will have been spent entirely asleep. Now what that    years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important. And yet  for most of us  we don't give sleep a second thought. We throw it away. We really just don't think about sleep. And so what I'd like to do today is change your views  change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep. And the journey that I want to take you on  we need to start by going back in time.  Enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber.  Any ideas who said that  Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Yes  let me give you a few more quotes.  O sleep  O gentle sleep  nature's soft nurse  how have I frighted thee   Shakespeare again  from    I won't say it    the Scottish play. From the same time   Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.  Extremely prophetic  by Thomas Dekker  another Elizabethan dramatist. But if we jump forward     years  the tone about sleep changes somewhat. This is from Thomas Edison  from the beginning of the   th century   Sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days.  Bang  And if we also jump into the     s  some of you may remember that Margaret Thatcher was reported to have said   Sleep is for wimps.  And of course the infamous    what was his name     the infamous Gordon Gekko from  Wall Street  said   Money never sleeps.  What do we do in the   th century about sleep  Well  of course  we use Thomas Edison's light bulb to invade the night  and we occupied the dark  and in the process of this occupation  we've treated sleep as an illness  almost. We've treated it as an enemy. At most now  I suppose  we tolerate the need for sleep  and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep as an illness that needs some sort of a cure. And our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound. Why is it  Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts  Well  it's because you don't do anything much while you're asleep  it seems. You don't eat. You don't drink. And you don't have sex. Well  most of us anyway. And so  therefore it's    Sorry. It's a complete waste of time  right  Wrong. Actually  sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology  and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it's so very important. So let's move to the brain. Now  here we have a brain. This is donated by a social scientist  and they said they didn't know what it was or indeed  how to use it  so    Sorry. So I borrowed it. I don't think they noticed. OK. The point I'm trying to make is that when you're asleep  this thing doesn't shut down. In fact  some areas of the brain are actually more active during the sleep state than during the wake state. The other thing that's really important about sleep is that it doesn't arise from a single structure within the brain  but is to some extent a network property. If we flip the brain on its back    I love this little bit of spinal cord here    this bit here is the hypothalamus  and right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures  not least the biological clock. The biological clock tells us when it's good to be up  when it's good to be asleep  and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus  the lateral hypothalamus  the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei. All of those combine  and they send projections down to the brain stem here. The brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex  this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here  with neurotransmitters that keep us awake and essentially provide us with our consciousness. So sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions within the brain  and essentially  sleep is turned on and off as a result of a range of interactions in here. OK. So where have we got to  We've said that sleep is complicated and it takes    years of our life. But what I haven't explained is what sleep is about. So why do we sleep  And it won't surprise any of you that  of course  as scientists  we don't have a consensus. There are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep  and I'm going to outline three of those. The first is sort of the restoration idea  and it's somewhat intuitive. Essentially  all the stuff we've burned up during the day  we restore  we replace  we rebuild during the night. And indeed  as an explanation  it goes back to Aristotle  so that's what          years ago. It's gone in and out of fashion. It's fashionable at the moment because what's been shown is that within the brain  a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep  and those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways. So there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis. What about energy conservation  Again  perhaps intuitive. You essentially sleep to save calories. Now  when you do the sums  though  it doesn't really pan out. If you compare an individual who has slept at night  or stayed awake and hasn't moved very much  the energy saving of sleeping is about     calories a night. Now  that's the equivalent of a hot dog bun. Now  I would say that a hot dog bun is kind of a meager return for such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep. So I'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea. But the third idea I'm quite attracted to  which is brain processing and memory consolidation. What we know is that  if after you've tried to learn a task  and you sleep deprive individuals  the ability to learn that task is smashed. It's really hugely attenuated. So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important. However  it's not just the laying down of memory and recalling it. What's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep. In fact  it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage. Sleeping at night enhances our creativity. And what seems to be going on is that  in the brain  those neural connections that are important  those synaptic connections that are important  are linked and strengthened  while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important. OK. So we've had three explanations for why we might sleep  and I think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary  and it's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons. But sleep is not an indulgence. It's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually. I think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade from economy to business class  you know  the equivalent of. It's not even an upgrade from economy to first class. The critical thing to realize is that if you don't sleep  you don't fly. Essentially  you never get there. And what's extraordinary about much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleep deprived. So let's now look at sleep deprivation. Huge sectors of society are sleep deprived  and let's look at our sleep o meter. So in the     s  good data suggests that most of us were getting around eight hours of sleep a night. Nowadays  we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night  so we're in the six and a half hours every night league. For teenagers  it's worse  much worse. They need nine hours for full brain performance  and many of them  on a school night  are only getting five hours of sleep. It's simply not enough. If we think about other sectors of society    the aged  if you are aged  then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted  and many sleep  again  less than five hours a night. Shift work. Shift work is extraordinary  perhaps    percent of the working population  and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night. It's locked onto the same light dark cycle as the rest of us. So when the poor old shift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day  desperately tired  the body clock is saying   Wake up. This is the time to be awake.  So the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor  again in that sort of five hour region. And then  of course  tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag. So who here has jet lag  Well  my goodness gracious. Well  thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep  because that's what your brain is craving. One of the things that the brain does is indulge in micro sleeps  this involuntary falling asleep  and you have essentially no control over it. Now  micro sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing  but they can also be deadly. It's been estimated that    percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life  and in the US  the statistics are pretty good          accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness  loss of vigilance  and falling asleep    a hundred thousand a year. It's extraordinary. At another level of terror  we dip into the tragic accidents at Chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle Challenger  which was so tragically lost. And in the investigations that followed those disasters  poor judgment as a result of extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk of those disasters. When you're tired and you lack sleep  you have poor memory  you have poor creativity  you have increased impulsiveness  and you have overall poor judgment. But my friends  it's so much worse than that. If you are a tired brain  the brain is craving things to wake it up. So drugs  stimulants. Caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across much of the Western world. Much of the day is fueled by caffeine  and if you're a really naughty tired brain  nicotine. Of course  you're fueling the waking state with these stimulants  and then  of course  it gets to    o'clock at night  and the brain says to itself   Actually  I need to be asleep fairly shortly. What do we do about that when I'm feeling completely wired   Well  of course  you then resort to alcohol. Now alcohol  short term  you know  once or twice  to use to mildly sedate you  can be very useful. It can actually ease the sleep transition. But what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep. A biological mimic for sleep  it sedates you. So it actually harms some of the neural processing that's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall. So it's a short term acute measure  but for goodness sake  don't become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night. Another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain. If you sleep around about five hours or less every night  then you have a    percent likelihood of being obese. What's the connection here  Well  sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin  the hunger hormone. Ghrelin is released. It gets to the brain. The brain says   I need carbohydrates   and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars. So there's a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain  stress. Tired people are massively stressed. And one of the things of stress  of course  is loss of memory  which is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of. But stress is so much more. So  if you're acutely stressed  not a great problem  but it's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that's the problem. Sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity. And so  tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection  and there's some very good studies showing that shift workers  for example  have higher rates of cancer. Increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation. Glucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature and essentially you become glucose intolerant. Therefore  diabetes  . Stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure. So there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss that are more than just a mildly impaired brain  which is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides. So at this point in the talk  this is a nice time to think   Well  do you think on the whole I'm getting enough sleep   So a quick show of hands. Who feels that they're getting enough sleep here  Oh. Well  that's pretty impressive. Good. We'll talk more about that later  about what are your tips. So most of us  of course  ask the question   How do I know whether I'm getting enough sleep   Well  it's not rocket science. If you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning  if you are taking a long time to get up  if you need lots of stimulants  if you're grumpy  if you're irritable  if you're told by your work colleagues that you're looking tired and irritable  chances are you are sleep deprived. Listen to them. Listen to yourself. What do you do  Well    and this is slightly offensive    sleep for dummies. Make your bedroom a haven for sleep. The first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can  and also make it slightly cool. Very important. Actually  reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed. Light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep. What's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed  We stand in a massively lit bathroom  looking into the mirror cleaning our teeth. It's the worst thing we can possibly do before we go to sleep. Turn off those mobile phones. Turn off those computers. Turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain. Try not to drink caffeine too late in the day  ideally not after lunch. Now  we've set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed  but light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological clock to the light dark cycle. So seek out morning light. Basically  listen to yourself. Wind down. Do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the honey heavy dew of slumber. OK. That's some facts. What about some myths  Teenagers are lazy. No. Poor things. They have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late  so give them a break. We need eight hours of sleep a night. That's an average. Some people need more. Some people need less. And what you need to do is listen to your body. Do you need that much or do you need more  Simple as that. Old people need less sleep. Not true. The sleep demands of the aged do not go down. Essentially  sleep fragments and becomes less robust  but sleep requirements do not go down. And the fourth myth is early to bed  early to rise makes a man healthy  wealthy and wise. Well  that's wrong at so many different levels. There is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all. There's no difference in socioeconomic status. In my experience  the only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug. OK. So for the last few minutes  what I want to do is change gears and talk about some really new  breaking areas of neuroscience  which is the association between mental health  mental illness and sleep disruption. We've known for     years that in severe mental illness  there is always  always sleep disruption  but it's been largely ignored. In the     s  when people started to think about this again  they said   Yes  well  of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia  because they're on antipsychotics. It's the antipsychotics causing the sleep problems   ignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously  sleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics. So what's going on  Several groups are studying conditions like depression  schizophrenia and bipolar and what's going on in terms of sleep disruption. We have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia  and the data were quite extraordinary. In those individuals with schizophrenia  much of the time  they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day. Other groups showed no    hour patterns whatsoever    their sleep was absolutely smashed. And some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light dark cycle. They were getting up later and later and later and later each night. It was smashed. So what's going on  And the really exciting news is that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated  but they are physically linked within the brain. The neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep  give you normal sleep  and those that give you normal mental health  are overlapping. And what's the evidence for that  Well  genes that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal sleep  when mutated  when changed  also predispose individuals to mental health problems. And last year  we published a study which showed that a gene that's been linked to schizophrenia  when mutated  also smashes the sleep. So we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems. Other work flowed from these studies. The first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types of mental illness  and we've shown that in those young individuals who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder  they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical diagnosis of bipolar. The other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate  make worse  the mental illness state. My colleague Dan Freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by    percent. So what have we got  We've got  in these connections  some really exciting things. In terms of the neuroscience  by understanding these two systems  we're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain. The second area is that if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal  then we have the chance of going in. If we know these individuals are vulnerable  early intervention then becomes possible. And the third  which I think is the most exciting  is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target. Stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable  we can certainly make them healthier  but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness. So let me just finish. What I started by saying is  Take sleep seriously. Our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre industrial age  when we were almost wrapped in a duvet. We used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep. And this isn't some sort of crystal waving nonsense. This is a pragmatic response to good health. If you have good sleep  it increases your concentration  attention  decision making  creativity  social skills  health. If you get sleep  it reduces your mood changes  your stress  your levels of anger  your impulsivity  and your tendency to drink and take drugs. And we finished by saying that an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep is really informing the way we think about some of the causes of mental illness  and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions. Jim Butcher  the fantasy writer  said   Sleep is God. Go worship.  And I can only recommend that you do the same. Thank you for your attention. Steve Ramirez  My first year of grad school  I found myself in my bedroom eating lots of Ben   Jerry's watching some trashy TV and maybe  maybe listening to Taylor Swift. I had just gone through a breakup. So for the longest time  all I would do is recall the memory of this person over and over again  wishing that I could get rid of that gut wrenching  visceral  blah  feeling. Now  as it turns out  I'm a neuroscientist  so I knew that the memory of that person and the awful  emotional undertones that color in that memory  are largely mediated by separate brain systems. And so I thought  what if we could go into the brain and edit out that nauseating feeling but while keeping the memory of that person intact  Then I realized  maybe that's a little bit lofty for now. So what if we could start off by going into the brain and just finding a single memory to begin with  Could we jump start that memory back to life  maybe even play with the contents of that memory  All that said  there is one person in the entire world right now that I really hope is not watching this talk. So there is a catch. There is a catch. These ideas probably remind you of  Total Recall    Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind   or of  Inception.  But the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab. Xu Liu  Test mice. As neuroscientists  we work in the lab with mice trying to understand how memory works. And today  we hope to convince you that now we are actually able to activate a memory in the brain at the speed of light. To do this  there's only two simple steps to follow. First  you find and label a memory in the brain  and then you activate it with a switch. As simple as that. SR  Are you convinced  So  turns out finding a memory in the brain isn't all that easy. XL  Indeed. This is way more difficult than  let's say  finding a needle in a haystack  because at least  you know  the needle is still something you can physically put your fingers on. But memory is not. And also  there's way more cells in your brain than the number of straws in a typical haystack. So yeah  this task does seem to be daunting. But luckily  we got help from the brain itself. It turned out that all we need to do is basically to let the brain form a memory  and then the brain will tell us which cells are involved in that particular memory. SR  So what was going on in my brain while I was recalling the memory of an ex  If you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now  you would see that there was an amazing number of brain regions that were active while recalling that memory. Now one brain region that would be robustly active in particular is called the hippocampus  which for decades has been implicated in processing the kinds of memories that we hold near and dear  which also makes it an ideal target to go into and to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory. XL  When you zoom in into the hippocampus  of course you will see lots of cells  but we are able to find which cells are involved in a particular memory  because whenever a cell is active  like when it's forming a memory  it will also leave a footprint that will later allow us to know these cells are recently active. SR  So the same way that building lights at night let you know that somebody's probably working there at any given moment  in a very real sense  there are biological sensors within a cell that are turned on only when that cell was just working. They're sort of biological windows that light up to let us know that that cell was just active. XL  So we clipped part of this sensor  and attached that to a switch to control the cells  and we packed this switch into an engineered virus and injected that into the brain of the mice. So whenever a memory is being formed  any active cells for that memory will also have this switch installed. SR  So here is what the hippocampus looks like after forming a fear memory  for example. The sea of blue that you see here are densely packed brain cells  but the green brain cells  the green brain cells are the ones that are holding on to a specific fear memory. So you are looking at the crystallization of the fleeting formation of fear. You're actually looking at the cross section of a memory right now. XL  Now  for the switch we have been talking about  ideally  the switch has to act really fast. It shouldn't take minutes or hours to work. It should act at the speed of the brain  in milliseconds. SR  So what do you think  Xu  Could we use  let's say  pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells  XL  Nah. Drugs are pretty messy. They spread everywhere. And also it takes them forever to act on cells. So it will not allow us to control a memory in real time. So Steve  how about let's zap the brain with electricity  SR  So electricity is pretty fast  but we probably wouldn't be able to target it to just the specific cells that hold onto a memory  and we'd probably fry the brain. XL  Oh. That's true. So it looks like  hmm  indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light. SR  So it just so happens that light travels at the speed of light. So maybe we could activate or inactive memories by just using light    XL  That's pretty fast. SR     and because normally brain cells don't respond to pulses of light  so those that would respond to pulses of light are those that contain a light sensitive switch. Now to do that  first we need to trick brain cells to respond to laser beams. XL  Yep. You heard it right. We are trying to shoot lasers into the brain. SR  And the technique that lets us do that is optogenetics. Optogenetics gave us this light switch that we can use to turn brain cells on or off  and the name of that switch is channelrhodopsin  seen here as these green dots attached to this brain cell. You can think of channelrhodopsin as a sort of light sensitive switch that can be artificially installed in brain cells so that now we can use that switch to activate or inactivate the brain cell simply by clicking it  and in this case we click it on with pulses of light. XL  So we attach this light sensitive switch of channelrhodopsin to the sensor we've been talking about and inject this into the brain. So whenever a memory is being formed  any active cell for that particular memory will also have this light sensitive switch installed in it so that we can control these cells by the flipping of a laser just like this one you see. SR  So let's put all of this to the test now. What we can do is we can take our mice and then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here  and then we can give them a very mild foot shock so that they form a fear memory of this box. They learn that something bad happened here. Now with our system  the cells that are active in the hippocampus in the making of this memory  only those cells will now contain channelrhodopsin. XL  When you are as small as a mouse  it feels as if the whole world is trying to get you. So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected. Whenever a mouse is in fear  it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box  trying to not move any part of its body  and this posture is called freezing. So if a mouse remembers that something bad happened in this box  and when we put them back into the same box  it will basically show freezing because it doesn't want to be detected by any potential threats in this box. SR  So you can think of freezing as  you're walking down the street minding your own business  and then out of nowhere you almost run into an ex girlfriend or ex boyfriend  and now those terrifying two seconds where you start thinking   What do I do  Do I say hi  Do I shake their hand  Do I turn around and run away  Do I sit here and pretend like I don't exist   Those kinds of fleeting thoughts that physically incapacitate you  that temporarily give you that deer in headlights look. XL  However  if you put the mouse in a completely different new box  like the next one  it will not be afraid of this box because there's no reason that it will be afraid of this new environment. But what if we put the mouse in this new box but at the same time  we activate the fear memory using lasers just like we did before  Are we going to bring back the fear memory for the first box into this completely new environment  SR  All right  and here's the million dollar experiment. Now to bring back to life the memory of that day  I remember that the Red Sox had just won  it was a green spring day  perfect for going up and down the river and then maybe going to the North End to get some cannolis   justsaying. Now Xu and I  on the other hand  were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen. We were looking at this mouse here trying to activate a memory for the first time using our technique. XL  And this is what we saw. When we first put the mouse into this box  it's exploring  sniffing around  walking around  minding its own business  because actually by nature  mice are pretty curious animals. They want to know  what's going on in this new box  It's interesting. But the moment we turned on the laser  like you see now  all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode. It stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body. Clearly it's freezing. So indeed  it looks like we are able to bring back the fear memory for the first box in this completely new environment. While watching this  Steve and I are as shocked as the mouse itself. So after the experiment  the two of us just left the room without saying anything. After a kind of long  awkward period of time  Steve broke the silence. SR   Did that just work   XL   Yes   I said.  Indeed it worked   We're really excited about this. And then we published our findings in the journal Nature. Ever since the publication of our work  we've been receiving numerous comments from all over the Internet. Maybe we can take a look at some of those.   OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come  virtual reality  neural manipulation  visual dream emulation... neural coding  'writing and re writing of memories'  mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome   SR  So the first thing that you'll notice is that people have really strong opinions about this kind of work. Now I happen to completely agree with the optimism of this first quote  because on a scale of zero to Morgan Freeman's voice  it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that I've heard come our way. But as you'll see  it's not the only opinion that's out there.   This scares the hell out of me... What if they could do that easily in humans in a couple of years   OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOMED   XL  Indeed  if we take a look at the second one  I think we can all agree that it's  meh  probably not as positive. But this also reminds us that  although we are still working with mice  it's probably a good idea to start thinking and discussing about the possible ethical ramifications of memory control. SR  Now  in the spirit of the third quote  we want to tell you about a recent project that we've been working on in lab that we've called Project Inception.   They should make a movie about this. Where they plant ideas into peoples minds  so they can control them for their own personal gain. We'll call it  Inception.   So we reasoned that now that we can reactivate a memory  what if we do so but then begin to tinker with that memory  Could we possibly even turn it into a false memory  XL  So all memory is sophisticated and dynamic  but if just for simplicity  let's imagine memory as a movie clip. So far what we've told you is basically we can control this  play  button of the clip so that we can play this video clip any time  anywhere. But is there a possibility that we can actually get inside the brain and edit this movie clip so that we can make it different from the original  Yes we can. Turned out that all we need to do is basically reactivate a memory using lasers just like we did before  but at the same time  if we present new information and allow this new information to incorporate into this old memory  this will change the memory. It's sort of like making a remix tape. SR  So how do we do this  Rather than finding a fear memory in the brain  we can start by taking our animals  and let's say we put them in a blue box like this blue box here and we find the brain cells that represent that blue box and we trick them to respond to pulses of light exactly like we had said before. Now the next day  we can take our animals and place them in a red box that they've never experienced before. We can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box. So what would happen here if  while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box  we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks  So here we're trying to artificially make an association between the memory of the blue box and the foot shocks themselves. We're just trying to connect the two. So to test if we had done so  we can take our animals once again and place them back in the blue box. Again  we had just reactivated the memory of the blue box while the animal got a couple of mild foot shocks  and now the animal suddenly freezes. It's as though it's recalling being mildly shocked in this environment even though that never actually happened. So it formed a false memory  because it's falsely fearing an environment where  technically speaking  nothing bad actually happened to it. XL  So  so far we are only talking about this light controlled  on  switch. In fact  we also have a light controlled  off  switch  and it's very easy to imagine that by installing this light controlled  off  switch  we can also turn off a memory  any time  anywhere. So everything we've been talking about today is based on this philosophically charged principle of neuroscience that the mind  with its seemingly mysterious properties  is actually made of physical stuff that we can tinker with. SR  And for me personally  I see a world where we can reactivate any kind of memory that we'd like. I also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories. Now  I even see a world where editing memories is something of a reality  because we're living in a time where it's possible to pluck questions from the tree of science fiction and to ground them in experimental reality. XL  Nowadays  people in the lab and people in other groups all over the world are using similar methods to activate or edit memories  whether that's old or new  positive or negative  all sorts of memories so that we can understand how memory works. SR  For example  one group in our lab was able to find the brain cells that make up a fear memory and converted them into a pleasurable memory  just like that. That's exactly what I mean about editing these kinds of processes. Now one dude in lab was even able to reactivate memories of female mice in male mice  which rumor has it is a pleasurable experience. XL  Indeed  we are living in a very exciting moment where science doesn't have any arbitrary speed limits but is only bound by our own imagination. SR  And finally  what do we make of all this  How do we push this technology forward  These are the questions that should not remain just inside the lab  and so one goal of today's talk was to bring everybody up to speed with the kind of stuff that's possible in modern neuroscience  but now  just as importantly  to actively engage everybody in this conversation. So let's think together as a team about what this all means and where we can and should go from here  because Xu and I think we all have some really big decisions ahead of us. Thank you. XL  Thank you. I come from Lebanon  and I believe that running can change the world. I know what I have just said is simply not obvious. You know  Lebanon as a country has been once destroyed by a long and bloody civil war. Honestly  I don't know why they call it civil war when there is nothing civil about it. With Syria to the north  Israel and Palestine to the south  and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable. For years  the country has been divided between politics and religion. However  for one day a year  we truly stand united  and that's when the marathon takes place. I used to be a marathon runner. Long distance running was not only good for my well being but it helped me meditate and dream big. So the longer distances I ran  the bigger my dreams became. Until one fateful morning  and while training  I was hit by a bus. I nearly died  was in a coma  stayed at the hospital for two years  and underwent    surgeries to be able to walk again. As soon as I came out of my coma  I realized that I was no longer the same runner I used to be  so I decided  if I couldn't run myself  I wanted to make sure that others could. So out of my hospital bed  I asked my husband to start taking notes  and a few months later  the marathon was born. Organizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident may sound strange  but at that time  even during my most vulnerable condition  I needed to dream big. I needed something to take me out of my pain  an objective to look forward to. I didn't want to pity myself  nor to be pitied  and I thought by organizing such a marathon  I'll be able to pay back to my community  build bridges with the outside world  and invite runners to come to Lebanon and run under the umbrella of peace. Organizing a marathon in Lebanon is definitely not like organizing one in New York. How do you introduce the concept of running to a nation that is constantly at the brink of war  How do you ask those who were once fighting and killing each other to come together and run next to each other  More than that  how do you convince people to run a distance of   .  miles at a time they were not even familiar with the word  marathon   So we had to start from scratch. For almost two years  we went all over the country and even visited remote villages. I personally met with people from all walks of life    mayors  NGOs  schoolchildren  politicians  militiamen  people from mosques  churches  the president of the country  even housewives. I learned one thing  When you walk the talk  people believe you. Many were touched by my personal story  and they shared their stories in return. It was honesty and transparency that brought us together. We spoke one common language to each other  and that was from one human to another. Once that trust was built  everybody wanted to be part of the marathon to show the world the true colors of Lebanon and the Lebanese and their desire to live in peace and harmony. In October       over       runners from    different nationalities came to the start line  all determined  and when the gunfire went off  this time it was a signal to run in harmony  for a change. The marathon grew. So did our political problems. But for every disaster we had  the marathon found ways to bring people together. In       our prime minister was assassinated  and the country came to a complete standstill  so we organized a five kilometer United We Run campaign. Over        people came to the start line  all wearing white T shirts with no political slogans. That was a turning point for the marathon  where people started looking at it as a platform for peace and unity. Between      up to       our country  Lebanon  went through unstable years  invasions  and more assassinations that brought us close to a civil war. The country was divided again  so much that our parliament resigned  we had no president for a year  and no prime minister. But we did have a marathon. So through the marathon  we learned that political problems can be overcome. When the opposition party decided to shut down part of the city center  we negotiated alternative routes. Government protesters became sideline cheerleaders. They even hosted juice stations. You know  the marathon has really become one of its kind. It gained credibility from both the Lebanese and the international community. Last November       over        runners from    different nationalities came to the start line  but this time  they challenged a very stormy and rainy weather. The streets were flooded  but people didn't want to miss out on the opportunity of being part of such a national day. BMA has expanded. We include everyone  the young  the elderly  the disabled  the mentally challenged  the blind  the elite  the amateur runners  even moms with their babies. Themes have included runs for the environment  breast cancer  for the love of Lebanon  for peace  or just simply to run. The first annual all women and girls race for empowerment  which is one of its kind in the region  has just taken place only a few weeks ago  with       women  including the first lady  and this is only the beginning. Thank you. BMA has supported charities and volunteers who have helped reshape Lebanon  raising funds for their causes and encouraging others to give. The culture of giving and doing good has become contagious. Stereotypes have been broken. Change makers and future leaders have been created. I believe these are the building blocks for future peace. BMA has become such a respected event in the region that government officials in the region  like Iraq  Egypt and Syria  have asked the organization to help them structure a similar sporting event. We are now one of the largest running events in the Middle East  but most importantly  it is a platform for hope and cooperation in an ever fragile and unstable part of the world. From Boston to Beirut  we stand as one. After    years in Lebanon  from national marathons or from national events to smaller regional races  we've seen that people want to run for a better future. After all  peacemaking is not a sprint. It is more of a marathon. Thank you. Ah yes  those university days  a heady mix of Ph.D level pure mathematics and world debating championships  or  as I like to say   Hello  ladies. Oh yeah.  Didn't get much sexier than the Spence at university  let me tell you. It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer from Sydney  Australia  to be here on the TED stage literally on the other side of the world. And I wanted to let you know  a lot of the things you've heard about Australians are true. From the youngest of ages  we display a prodigious sporting talent. On the field of battle  we are brave and noble warriors. What you've heard is true. Australians  we don't mind a bit of a drink  sometimes to excess  leading to embarrassing social situations.  Laughter  This is my father's work Christmas party  December     . I'm almost five years old. Fair to say  I'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was. But I stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host  not as a comedian  but as someone who was  is  and always will be a mathematician. And anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep. I cast my mind back when I was in second grade at a beautiful little government run school called Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney  and as we came up towards lunchtime  our teacher  Ms. Russell  said to the class   Hey  year two. What do you want to do after lunch  I've got no plans.  It was an exercise in democratic schooling  and I am all for democratic schooling  but we were only seven. So some of the suggestions we made as to what we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical  and after a while  someone made a particularly silly suggestion and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism   That wouldn't work. That'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole.  Now I wasn't trying to be smart. I wasn't trying to be funny. I just politely raised my hand  and when Ms. Russell acknowledged me  I said  in front of my year two classmates  and I quote   But Miss  surely if the diagonal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle  well  the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole.   It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop  wouldn't it   And there was that same awkward silence from most of my classmates  until sitting next to me  one of my friends  one of the cool kids in class  Steven  leaned across and punched me really hard in the head. Now what Steven was saying was   Look  Adam  you are at a critical juncture in your life here  my friend. You can keep sitting here with us. Any more of that sort of talk  you've got to go and sit over there with them.  I thought about it for a nanosecond. I took one look at the road map of life  and I ran off down the street marked  Geek  as fast as my chubby  asthmatic little legs would carry me. I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages. I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful. It's natural. It's everywhere. Numbers are the musical notes with which the symphony of the universe is written. The great Descartes said something quite similar. The universe  is written in the mathematical language.  And today  I want to show you one of those musical notes  a number so beautiful  so massive  I think it will blow your mind. Today we're going to talk about prime numbers. Most of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime because it's   x  . Seven is prime because it's   x    but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks  or as we call them  factors. Now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers. One is not prime. The proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties. Another thing about primes  there is no final biggest prime number. They keep going on forever. We know there are an infinite number of primes due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid. Over thousands of years ago  he proved that for us. But the third thing about prime numbers  mathematicians have always wondered  well at any given moment in time  what is the biggest prime that we know about  Today we're going to hunt for that massive prime. Don't freak out. All you need to know  of all the mathematics you've ever learned  unlearned  crammed  forgotten  never understood in the first place  all you need to know is this  When I say        I'm talking about five little number twos next to each other all multiplied together    x   x   x   x  . So       is   x                 . If you've got that  you're with me for the entire journey. Okay  So        those five little twos multiplied together.    is a prime number  and that five in the power is also a prime number. And the vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found are of that form  two to a prime number  take away one. I won't go into great detail as to why  because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do  but suffice to say  a number of that form is fairly easy to test for primacy. A random odd number is a lot harder to test. But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes  we realize it's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power. and you don't need me to tell you that's    x   . But                            After that point  they thin out a lot. And one of the things about the search for massive primes that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds of all time have gone on this search. This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. In the     s  other mathematicians said he is simply the master of us all. He was so respected  they put him on European currency back when that was a compliment. Euler discovered at the time the world's biggest prime  It's over two billion. He proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill  ink  paper and his mind. You think that's big. We know that               is a prime number. It's an absolute brute. Look at it here     digits long  proven to be prime in      by a mathematician called Lucas. Word up  L Dog. But one of the great things about the search for massive primes  it's not just finding the primes. Sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting. Lucas again  in       showed us                  digits long  was not prime. But he didn't know what the factors were. We knew it was like six  but we didn't know what are the   x   that multiply together to give us that massive number. We didn't know for almost    years until Frank Nelson Cole came along. And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians  he walked to the board  took up a piece of chalk  and started writing out the powers of two  two  four  eight        come on  join in with me  you know how it goes                                       . I'm in geek heaven. We'll stop it there for a second. Frank Nelson Cole did not stop there. He went on and on and calculated    powers of two. He took away one and wrote that number on the board. A frisson of excitement went around the room. It got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format    and for the rest of the hour of his talk Frank Nelson Cole busted that out. He had found the prime factors of             . The room went berserk    as Frank Nelson Cole sat down  having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words. He admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do. It took focus. It took dedication. It took him  by his estimate   three years of Sundays.  But then in the field of mathematics  as in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED  the age of the computer goes along and things explode. These are the largest prime numbers we knew decade by decade  each one dwarfing the one before as computers took over and our power to calculate just grew and grew. This is the largest prime number we knew in       a very emotional year for me. It was the year I left university. I was torn between mathematics and media. It was a tough decision. I loved university. My arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life. But I came to a realization about my own ability. Put simply  in a room full of randomly selected people  I'm a maths genius. In a roomful of maths Ph.Ds  I'm as dumb as a box of hammers. My skill is not in the mathematics. It is in telling the story of the mathematics. And during that time  since I've left university  these numbers have got bigger and bigger  each one dwarfing the last  until along came this man  Dr. Curtis Cooper  who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime  only to see it snatched away by a rival university. And then Curtis Cooper got it back. Not years ago  not months ago  days ago. In an amazing moment of serendipity  I had to send TED a new slide to show you what this guy had done. I still remember     Applause     I still remember when it happened. I was doing my breakfast radio show. I looked down on Twitter. There was a tweet   Adam  have you seen the new largest prime number   I shivered    contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room  and said  Girls  hold the front page. We're not talking politics today. We're not talking sport today. They found another megaprime.  The girls just shook their heads  put them in their hands  and let me go my own way. It's because of Curtis Cooper that we know  currently the largest prime number we know  is               . Don't forget to subtract the one. This number is almost    and a half million digits long. If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file  that's    meg. For the slightly less geeky of you  think about the Harry Potter novels  okay  This is the first Harry Potter novel. This is all seven Harry Potter novels  because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end. Written out as a book  this number would run the length of the Harry Potter novels and half again. Here's a slide of the first       digits of this prime. If  when TED had begun  at    o'clock on Tuesday  we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second  it would have taken five hours to show you that number. I was keen to do it  could not convince Bono. That's the way it goes. This number is    and a half thousand slides long  and we know it is prime as confidently as we know the number seven is prime. That fills me with almost sexual excitement. And who am I kidding when I say almost  I know what you're thinking  Adam  we're happy that you're happy  but why should we care  Let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful. First of all  as I explained  to ask a computer  Is that number prime   to type it in its abbreviated form  and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy  is a remarkably simple question to ask. It's got a remarkably clear yes no answer  and just requires phenomenal grunt. Large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips. But secondly  as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime  he wasn't the only guy searching. My laptop at home was looking through four potential candidate primes myself as part of a networked computer hunt around the world for these large numbers. The discovery of that prime is similar to the work people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences  in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects. We live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia but on laptops  desktops  in the palms of people's hands who are simply helping out for the search. But for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor for the time in which we live  when human minds and machines can conquer together. We've heard a lot about robots in this TED. We've heard a lot about what they can and can't do. It is true  you can now download onto your smartphone an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess. You think that's cool. Here's a machine doing something cool. This is the CubeStormer II. It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube. Using the power of the smartphone  it can examine the cube and solve the cube in five seconds. That scares some people. That excites me. How lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together  I was asked in an interview last year in my capacity as a lower case  c  celebrity in Australia   What was your highlight of        People were expecting me to talk about my beloved Sydney Swans football team. In our beautiful  indigenous sport of Australian football  they won the equivalent of the Super Bowl. I was there. It was the most emotional  exciting day. It wasn't my highlight of     . People thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show. It might have been a politician. It might have been a breakthrough. It might have been a book I read  the arts. No  no  no. It might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done. No  it wasn't. The highlight of       so clearly  was the discovery of the Higgs boson. Give it up for the fundamental particle that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass. And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was    years ago Peter Higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions  How is it that the things that make us up have no mass  I've clearly got mass. Where does it come from  And he postulated a suggestion that there's this infinite  incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe  and as other particles go through those particles and interact  that's where they get their mass. The rest of the scientific community said   Great idea  Higgsy. We've got no idea if we could ever prove it. It's beyond our reach.  And within just    years  in his lifetime  with him sitting in the audience  we had designed the greatest machine ever to prove this incredible idea that originated just in a human mind. That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number. We thought it might be there  and we went and found it. That is the essence of being human. That is what we are all about. Or as my friend Descartes might put it  we think  therefore we are. Thank you. I have a confession to make. But first  I want you to make a little confession to me. In the past year  I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively little stress. Anyone  How about a moderate amount of stress  Who has experienced a lot of stress  Yeah. Me too. But that is not my confession. My confession is this  I am a health psychologist  and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier. But I fear that something I've been teaching for the last    years is doing more harm than good  and it has to do with stress. For years I've been telling people  stress makes you sick. It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease. Basically  I've turned stress into the enemy. But I have changed my mind about stress  and today  I want to change yours. Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress. This study tracked        adults in the United States for eight years  and they started by asking people   How much stress have you experienced in the last year   They also asked   Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health   And then they used public death records to find out who died. Okay. Some bad news first. People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a    percent increased risk of dying. But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health. People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die. In fact  they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study  including people who had relatively little stress. Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths          Americans died prematurely  not from stress  but from the belief that stress is bad for you. That is over        deaths a year. Now  if that estimate is correct  that would make believing stress is bad for you the   th largest cause of death in the United States last year  killing more people than skin cancer  HIV AIDS and homicide. You can see why this study freaked me out. Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health. So this study got me wondering  Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier  And here the science says yes. When you change your mind about stress  you can change your body's response to stress. Now to explain how this works  I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out. It's called the social stress test. You come into the laboratory  and you're told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you  and to make sure you feel the pressure  there are bright lights and a camera in your face  kind of like this. And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging  non verbal feedback  like this. Now that you're sufficiently demoralized  time for part two  a math test. And unbeknownst to you  the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it. Now we're going to all do this together. It's going to be fun. For me. Okay. I want you all to count backwards from     in increments of seven. You're going to do this out loud  as fast as you can  starting with    . Go  Go faster. Faster please. You're going too slow. Stop. Stop  stop  stop. That guy made a mistake. We are going to have to start all over again. You're not very good at this  are you  Okay  so you get the idea. If you were actually in this study  you'd probably be a little stressed out. Your heart might be pounding  you might be breathing faster  maybe breaking out into a sweat. And normally  we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure. But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized  was preparing you to meet this challenge  Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University. Before they went through the social stress test  they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful. That pounding heart is preparing you for action. If you're breathing faster  it's no problem. It's getting more oxygen to your brain. And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance  well  they were less stressed out  less anxious  more confident  but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed. Now  in a typical stress response  your heart rate goes up  and your blood vessels constrict like this. And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease. It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time. But in the study  when participants viewed their stress response as helpful  their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this. Their heart was still pounding  but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile. It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage. Over a lifetime of stressful experiences  this one biological change could be the difference between a stress induced heart attack at age    and living well into your   s. And this is really what the new science of stress reveals  that how you think about stress matters. So my goal as a health psychologist has changed. I no longer want to get rid of your stress. I want to make you better at stress. And we just did a little intervention. If you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year  we could have saved your life  because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress  you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself  this is my body helping me rise to this challenge. And when you view stress in that way  your body believes you  and your stress response becomes healthier. Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from  so we are going to do one more intervention. I want to tell you about one of the most under appreciated aspects of the stress response  and the idea is this  Stress makes you social. To understand this side of stress  we need to talk about a hormone  oxytocin  and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname  the cuddle hormone  because it's released when you hug someone. But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in. Oxytocin is a neuro hormone. It fine tunes your brain's social instincts. It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships. Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family. It enhances your empathy. It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about. Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin... to become more compassionate and caring. But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin. It's a stress hormone. Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response. It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound. And when oxytocin is released in the stress response  it is motivating you to seek support. Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel  instead of bottling it up. Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other. When life is difficult  your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you. Okay  so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier  Well  oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain. It also acts on your body  and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress. It's a natural anti inflammatory. It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress. But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart. Your heart has receptors for this hormone  and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress induced damage. This stress hormone strengthens your heart. And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support. So when you reach out to others under stress  either to seek support or to help someone else  you release more of this hormone  your stress response becomes healthier  and you actually recover faster from stress. I find this amazing  that your stress response has a built in mechanism for stress resilience  and that mechanism is human connection. I want to finish by telling you about one more study. And listen up  because this study could also save a life. This study tracked about       adults in the United States  and they ranged in age from    to     and they started the study by asking   How much stress have you experienced in the last year   They also asked   How much time have you spent helping out friends  neighbors  people in your community   And then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died. Okay  so the bad news first  For every major stressful life experience  like financial difficulties or family crisis  that increased the risk of dying by    percent. But    and I hope you are expecting a  but  by now    but that wasn't true for everyone. People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress related increase in dying. Zero. Caring created resilience. And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with others under stress  you can create resilience. Now I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life  but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress. Stress gives us access to our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others  and yes  your pounding physical heart  working so hard to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in this way  you're not just getting better at stress  you're actually making a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone. Thank you. Chris Anderson  This is kind of amazing  what you're telling us. It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy. How would that extend to advice  like  if someone is making a lifestyle choice between  say  a stressful job and a non stressful job  does it matter which way they go  It's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it  in some sense  KM  Yeah  and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort. And so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions  is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows. CA  Thank you so much  Kelly. It's pretty cool. So here's the most important economic fact of our time. We are living in an age of surging income inequality  particularly between those at the very top and everyone else. This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.  but it's a global phenomenon. It's happening in communist China  in formerly communist Russia  it's happening in India  in my own native Canada. We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies like Sweden  Finland and Germany. Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening. In the     s  the One Percent accounted for about    percent of the national income in the United States. Today  their share has more than doubled to above    percent. But what's even more striking is what's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution. The  .  percent in the U.S. today account for more than eight percent of the national income. They are where the One Percent was    years ago. Let me give you another number to put that in perspective  and this is a figure that was calculated in      by Robert Reich  the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men  Bill Gates and Warren Buffett  and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth of the bottom    percent of the U.S. population      million people. Now  as it happens  Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat  he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon  and he has his own favorite number. Buffett likes to point out that in       the combined wealth of the people on the Forbes     list    and this is the list of the     richest Americans    was     billion dollars. Just think about it. You didn't even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in     . Well  today  that figure has more than quintupled to  .  trillion  and I probably don't need to tell you that we haven't seen anything similar happen to the middle class  whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased. So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy  but we've been slow to notice it. One of the reasons  I think  is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon. Changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic. Think about what happened  after all  to the poor frog. But I think there's something else going on. Talking about income inequality  even if you're not on the Forbes     list  can make us feel uncomfortable. It feels less positive  less optimistic  to talk about how the pie is sliced than to think about how to make the pie bigger. And if you do happen to be on the Forbes     list  talking about income distribution  and inevitably its cousin  income redistribution  can be downright threatening. So we're living in the age of surging income inequality  especially at the top. What's driving it  and what can we do about it  One set of causes is political  lower taxes  deregulation  particularly of financial services  privatization  weaker legal protections for trade unions  all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very  very top. A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of  crony capitalism   political changes that benefit a group of well connected insiders but don't actually do much good for the rest of us. In practice  getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult. Think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia  for instance  or how hard it is to re regulate the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the Great Depression  or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies  including those whose motto might be  don't do evil   to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class. But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice is really  really hard  at least intellectually  it's an easy problem. After all  no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism. Indeed  this is one of those rare issues that unites the left and the right. A critique of crony capitalism is as central to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street. But if crony capitalism is  intellectually at least  the easy part of the problem  things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality. In and of themselves  these aren't too mysterious. Globalization and the technology revolution  the twin economic transformations which are changing our lives and transforming the global economy  are also powering the rise of the super rich. Just think about it. For the first time in history  if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea or a fantastic new product  you have almost instant  almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people. As a result  if you are very  very smart and very  very lucky  you can get very  very rich very  very quickly. The latest poster boy for this phenomenon is David Karp. The    year old founder of Tumblr recently sold his company to Yahoo for  .  billion dollars. Think about that for a minute   .  billion dollars     years old. It's easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields  like sports and entertainment. We can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before. But today  that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy. We have superstar technologists. We have superstar bankers. We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects. There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers. There are even  and this is my personal favorite example  superstar dentists  the most dazzling exemplar of whom is Bernard Touati  the Frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich or European born American fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution are creating this global plutocracy  what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it. And that's because  in contrast with crony capitalism  so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive. Let's start with technology. I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices. I love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium. I'm even more of a fan of globalization. This is the transformation which has lifted hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people out of poverty and into the middle class  and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world  it's made many new products affordable    who do you think built your iPhone    and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper. Think of your dishwasher or your t shirt. So what's not to like  Well  a few things. One of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy. Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur who has successfully sold that idea or that product to the global billions and become a billionaire in the process. It gets tempting at that point to use your economic nous to manipulate the rules of the global political economy in your own favor. And that's no mere hypothetical example. Think about Amazon  Apple  Google  Starbucks. These are among the world's most admired  most beloved  most innovative companies. They also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very  very significantly. And why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage  Once you have the tremendous economic power that we're seeing at the very  very top of the income distribution and the political power that inevitably entails  it becomes tempting as well to start trying to change the rules of the game in your own favor. Again  this is no mere hypothetical. It's what the Russian oligarchs did in creating the sale of the century privatization of Russia's natural resources. It's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the U.S. and the U.K. A second thing that worries me is how easily meritocratic plutocracy can become aristocracy. One way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks  and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy. That's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children. The middle class is spending more on schooling too  but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at Harvard  Stanford or MIT  the    percent is increasingly outgunned by the One Percent. The result is something that economists Alan Krueger and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve. As income inequality increases  social mobility decreases. The plutocracy may be a meritocracy  but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race. The third thing  and this is what worries me the most  is the extent to which those same largely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy also happen to be hollowing out the middle class in Western industrialized economies. Let's start with technology. Those same forces that are creating billionaires are also devouring many traditional middle class jobs. When's the last time you used a travel agent  And in contrast with the industrial revolution  the titans of our new economy aren't creating that many new jobs. At its zenith  G.M. employed hundreds of thousands  Facebook fewer than       . The same is true of globalization. For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets  it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed Western economies. The terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity. That's shown in what I consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time. Since the late     s  increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment. That means that our countries are getting richer  our companies are getting more efficient  but we're not creating more jobs and we're not paying people  as a whole  more. One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment. What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario. After all  in a totally free labor market  we could find jobs for pretty much everyone. The dystopia that worries me is a universe in which a few geniuses invent Google and its ilk and the rest of us are employed giving them massages. So when I get really depressed about all of this  I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution. After all  for all its grim  satanic mills  it worked out pretty well  didn't it  After all  all of us here are richer  healthier  taller    well  there are a few exceptions   and live longer than our ancestors in the early   th century. But it's important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society  we had to go through two depressions  the Great Depression of the     s  the Long Depression of the     s  two world wars  communist revolutions in Russia and in China  and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the West. We also  not coincidentally  went through an era of tremendous social and political inventions. We created the modern welfare state. We created public education. We created public health care. We created public pensions. We created unions. Today  we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the Industrial Revolution. To be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats  we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change. We need a new New Deal. You may want to take a closer look. There's more to this painting than meets the eye. And yes  it's an acrylic painting of a man  but I didn't paint it on canvas. I painted it directly on top of the man. What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether  and if I want to paint your portrait  I'm painting it on you  physically on you. That also means you're probably going to end up with an earful of paint  because I need to paint your ear on your ear. Everything in this scene  the person  the clothes  chairs  wall  gets covered in a mask of paint that mimics what's directly below it  and in this way  I'm able to take a three dimensional scene and make it look like a two dimensional painting. I can photograph it from any angle  and it will still look  D. There's no Photoshop here. This is just a photo of one of my three dimensional paintings. You might be wondering how I came up with this idea of turning people into paintings. But originally  this had nothing to do with either people or paint. It was about shadows. I was fascinated with the absence of light  and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed. I came up with the idea of painting shadows. I loved that I could hide within this shadow my own painted version  and it would be almost invisible until the light changed  and all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light. I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on  and I thought of my friend Bernie. But I didn't just want to paint the shadows. I also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale. I had a very specific vision of what this would look like  and as I was painting him  I made sure to follow that very closely. But something kept on flickering before my eyes. I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at. And then when I took that moment to take a step back  magic. I had turned my friend into a painting. I couldn't have foreseen that when I wanted to paint a shadow  I would pull out this whole other dimension  that I would collapse it  that I would take a painting and make it my friend and then bring him back to a painting. I was a little conflicted though  because I was so excited about what I'd found  but I was just about to graduate from college with a degree in political science  and I'd always had this dream of going to Washington  D.C.  and sitting at a desk and working in government. Why did this have to get in the way of all that  I made the tough decision of going home after graduation and not going up to Capitol Hill  but going down to my parents' basement and making it my job to learn how to paint. I had no idea where to begin. The last time I'd painted  I was    years old at summer camp  and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and practicing over and over again on that surface  because that's not what this project was about for me. It was about space and light. My early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas  like fried food. It's nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg. Even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit. It just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink. I'd put something down  and instantly it would be gone. And if I wanted to paint on people  well  I was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that I spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast. It just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself. One of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only didn't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his ears  but he also didn't really have much embarrassment about being taken out into very public places for exhibition  like the Metro. I was having so much fun with this process. I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles  and I wanted to see what else I could do with it. I came together with a collaborator  Sheila Vand  and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface  and that was milk. We got a pool. We filled it with milk. We filled it with Sheila. And I began painting. And the images were always completely unexpected in the end  because I could have a very specific image about how it would turn out  I could paint it to match that  but the moment that Sheila laid back into the milk  everything would change. It was in constant flux  and we had to  rather than fight it  embrace it  see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better. Sometimes  when Sheila would lay down in the milk  it would wash all the paint off of her arms  and it might seem a little bit clumsy  but our solution would be  okay  hide your arms. And one time  she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face. All right  well  hide your face. And we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined  even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands  just hiding them in the pockets. When we started out on the milk project  and when I started out  I couldn't have foreseen that I would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tripping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk. But then again  I guess it's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar  as long as you're willing to look beyond what's already been brought to light  that you can see what's below the surface  hiding in the shadows  and recognize that there can be more there than meets the eye. Thank you. When I was a young man  I spent six years of wild adventure in the tropics working as an investigative journalist in some of the most bewitching parts of the world. I was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be. This is why wars get fought. But I also felt more alive than I've ever done since. And when I came home  I found the scope of my existence gradually diminishing until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge. And I found myself sort of scratching at the walls of life  as if I was trying to find a way out into a wider space beyond. I was  I believe  ecologically bored. Now  we evolved in rather more challenging times than these  in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws. And we still possess the fear and the courage and the aggression required to navigate those times. But in our comfortable  safe  crowded lands  we have few opportunities to exercise them without harming other people. And this was the sort of constraint that I found myself bumping up against. To conquer uncertainty  to know what comes next  that's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies  and having got there  or almost got there  we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs. We've privileged safety over experience and we've gained a lot in doing so  but I think we've lost something too. Now  I don't romanticize evolutionary time. I'm already beyond the lifespan of most hunter gatherers  and the outcome of a mortal combat between me myopically stumbling around with a stone tipped spear and an enraged giant aurochs isn't very hard to predict. Nor was it authenticity that I was looking for. I don't find that a useful or even intelligible concept. I just wanted a richer and rawer life than I've been able to lead in Britain  or  indeed  that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world. And it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word that I began to understand what I was looking for. And as soon as I found that word  I realized that I wanted to devote much of the rest of my life to it. The word is  rewilding   and even though rewilding is a young word  it already has several definitions. But there are two in particular that fascinate me. The first one is the mass restoration of ecosystems. One of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades. A trophic cascade is an ecological process which starts at the top of the food chain and tumbles all the way down to the bottom  and the classic example is what happened in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States when wolves were reintroduced in     . Now  we all know that wolves kill various species of animals  but perhaps we're slightly less aware that they give life to many others. It sounds strange  but just follow me for a while. Before the wolves turned up  they'd been absent for    years. The numbers of deer  because there was nothing to hunt them  had built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park  and despite efforts by humans to control them  they'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there to almost nothing  they'd just grazed it away. But as soon as the wolves arrived  even though they were few in number  they started to have the most remarkable effects. First  of course  they killed some of the deer  but that wasn't the major thing. Much more significantly  they radically changed the behavior of the deer. The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park  the places where they could be trapped most easily  particularly the valleys and the gorges  and immediately those places started to regenerate. In some areas  the height of the trees quintupled in just six years. Bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen and willow and cottonwood. And as soon as that happened  the birds started moving in. The number of songbirds  of migratory birds  started to increase greatly. The number of beavers started to increase  because beavers like to eat the trees. And beavers  like wolves  are ecosystem engineers. They create niches for other species. And the dams they built in the rivers provided habitats for otters and muskrats and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians. The wolves killed coyotes  and as a result of that  the number of rabbits and mice began to rise  which meant more hawks  more weasels  more foxes  more badgers. Ravens and bald eagles came down to feed on the carrion that the wolves had left. Bears fed on it too  and their population began to rise as well  partly also because there were more berries growing on the regenerating shrubs  and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves by killing some of the calves of the deer. But here's where it gets really interesting. The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers. They began to meander less. There was less erosion. The channels narrowed. More pools formed  more riffle sections  all of which were great for wildlife habitats. The rivers changed in response to the wolves  and the reason was that the regenerating forests stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often  so that the rivers became more fixed in their course. Similarly  by driving the deer out of some places and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides  there was less soil erosion  because the vegetation stabilized that as well. So the wolves  small in number  transformed not just the ecosystem of the Yellowstone National Park  this huge area of land  but also its physical geography. Whales in the southern oceans have similarly wide ranging effects. One of the many post rational excuses made by the Japanese government for killing whales is that they said   Well  the number of fish and krill will rise and then there'll be more for people to eat.  Well  it's a stupid excuse  but it sort of kind of makes sense  doesn't it  because you'd think that whales eat huge amounts of fish and krill  so obviously take the whales away  there'll be more fish and krill. But the opposite happened. You take the whales away  and the number of krill collapses. Why would that possibly have happened  Well  it now turns out that the whales are crucial to sustaining that entire ecosystem  and one of the reasons for this is that they often feed at depth and then they come up to the surface and produce what biologists politely call large fecal plumes  huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters  up in the photic zone  where there's enough light to allow photosynthesis to take place  and those great plumes of fertilizer stimulate the growth of phytoplankton  the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain  which stimulate the growth of zooplankton  which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it. The other thing that whales do is that  as they're plunging up and down through the water column  they're kicking the phytoplankton back up towards the surface where it can continue to survive and reproduce. And interestingly  well  we know that plant plankton in the oceans absorb carbon from the atmosphere    the more plant plankton there are  the more carbon they absorb    and eventually they filter down into the abyss and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system. Well  it seems that when whales were at their historic populations  they were probably responsible for sequestering some tens of millions of tons of carbon every year from the atmosphere. And when you look at it like that  you think  wait a minute  here are the wolves changing the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park. Here are the whales changing the composition of the atmosphere. You begin to see that possibly  the evidence supporting James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis  which conceives of the world as a coherent  self regulating organism  is beginning  at the ecosystem level  to accumulate. Trophic cascades tell us that the natural world is even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was. They tell us that when you take away the large animals  you are left with a radically different ecosystem to one which retains its large animals. And they make  in my view  a powerful case for the reintroduction of missing species. Rewilding  to me  means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals. It means taking down the fences  it means blocking the drainage ditches  it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea  but otherwise stepping back. It has no view as to what a right ecosystem or a right assemblage of species looks like. It doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef. It lets nature decide  and nature  by and large  is pretty good at deciding. Now  I mentioned that there are two definitions of rewilding that interest me. The other one is the rewilding of human life. And I don't see this as an alternative to civilization. I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology  as we're doing now  but at the same time  if we choose  have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure when we want to because there would be wonderful  rewilded habitats. And the opportunities for this are developing more rapidly than you might think possible. There's one estimate which suggests that in the United States  two thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared has become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated  particularly from the eastern half of the country. There's another one which suggests that    million hectares of land in Europe  an area the size of Poland  will be vacated by farmers between      and     . Now  faced with opportunities like that  does it not seem a little unambitious to be thinking only of bringing back wolves  lynx  bears  beavers  bison  boar  moose  and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across Europe  Perhaps we should also start thinking about the return of some of our lost megafauna. What megafauna  you say  Well  every continent had one  apart from Antarctica. When Trafalgar Square in London was excavated  the river gravels there were found to be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus  rhinos  elephants  hyenas  lions. Yes  ladies and gentlemen  there were lions in Trafalgar Square long before Nelson's Column was built. All these species lived here in the last interglacial period  when temperatures were pretty similar to our own. It's not climate  largely  which has got rid of the world's megafaunas. It's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so. And even so  you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems. Why is it that so many deciduous trees are able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken  Why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark  Why do understory trees  which are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind and have to carry less weight than the big canopy trees  why are they so much tougher and harder to break than the canopy trees are  Elephants. They are elephant adapted. In Europe  for example  they evolved to resist the straight tusked elephant  elephas antiquus  which was a great beast. It was related to the Asian elephant  but it was a temperate animal  a temperate forest creature. It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant. But why is it that some of our common shrubs have spines which seem to be over engineered to resist browsing by deer  Perhaps because they evolved to resist browsing by rhinoceros. Isn't it an amazing thought that every time you wander into a park or down an avenue or through a leafy street  you can see the shadows of these great beasts  Paleoecology  the study of past ecosystems  crucial to an understanding of our own  feels like a portal through which you may pass into an enchanted kingdom. And if we really are looking at areas of land of the sort of sizes I've been talking about becoming available  why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna  or at least species closely related to those which have become extinct everywhere  Why shouldn't all of us have a Serengeti on our doorsteps  And perhaps this is the most important thing that rewilding offers us  the most important thing that's missing from our lives  hope. In motivating people to love and defend the natural world  an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair. The story rewilding tells us is that ecological change need not always proceed in one direction. It offers us the hope that our silent spring could be replaced by a raucous summer. Thank you. This is Charley Williams. He was    when this photograph was taken. In the     s  Roosevelt put thousands and thousands of Americans back to work by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels  but he also did something interesting  which was to hire a few hundred writers to scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans. Charley Williams  a poor sharecropper  wouldn't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview  but Charley had actually been a slave until he was    years old. And the stories that were captured of his life make up one of the crown jewels of histories  of human lived experiences filled with ex slaves. Anna Deavere Smith famously said that there's a literature inside of each of us  and three generations later  I was part of a project called StoryCorps  which set out to capture the stories of ordinary Americans by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces. The idea is very  very simple. You go into these booths  you interview your grandmother or relative  you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the Library of Congress. It's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive one conversation at a time. And the question is  who do you want to remember    if you had just    minutes with your grandmother  What's interesting  in conversations with the founder  Dave Isay  we always actually talked about this as a little bit of a subversive project  because when you think about it  it's actually not really about the stories that are being told  it's about listening  and it's about the questions that you get to ask  questions that you may not have permission to on any other day. I'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project.  Jesus Melendez talking about poet Pedro Pietri's final moments  Jesus Melendez  We took off  and as we were ascending  before we had leveled off  our level off point was        feet  so before we had leveled off  Pedro began leaving us  and the beauty about it is that I believe that there's something after life. You can see it in Pedro.  Danny Perasa to his wife Annie Perasa married    years  Danny Perasa  See  the thing of it is  I always feel guilty when I say  I love you  to you  and I say it so often. I say it to remind you that as dumpy as I am  it's coming from me  it's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio  and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.  Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz  Michael Wolmetz  So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother  and we can leave it there. And he saved up and he purchased this  and he proposed to my mother with this  and so I thought that I would give it to you so that he could be with us for this also. So I'm going to share a mic with you right now  Debora. Where's the right finger  Debora Brakarz   Crying  MW  Debora  will you please marry me  DB  Yes. Of course. I love you. MW  So kids  this is how your mother and I got married  in a booth in Grand Central Station with my father's ring. My grandfather was a cab driver for    years. He used to pick people up here every day. So it seems right. Jake Barton  So I have to say I did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry. The entire project is predicated on this act of love which is listening itself. And that motion of building an institution out of a moment of conversation and listening is actually a lot of what my firm  Local Projects  is doing with our engagements in general. So we're a media design firm  and we're working with a broad array of different institutions building media installations for museums and public spaces. Our latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art  which we've created an engagement called Gallery One for. And Gallery One is an interesting project because it started with this massive       million expansion for the Cleveland Museum of Art  and we actually brought in this piece specifically to grow new capacity  new audiences  at the same time that the museum itself is growing. Glenn Lowry  the head of MoMA  put it best when he said   We want visitors to actually cease being visitors. Visitors are transient. We want people who live here  people who have ownership.  And so what we're doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries  so you can still have a traditional gallery experience  but if you're interested  you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it's from  or manipulate the work itself. So  for example  you can click on this individual lion head  and this is where it originated from       B.C. Or this individual piece here  you can see the actual bedroom. It really changes the way you think about this type of a tempera painting. This is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself. This is Rodin's bust. You get the sense of this incredible factory for creativity. And it makes you think about literally the hundreds or thousands of years of human creativity and how each individual artwork stands in for part of that story. This is Picasso  of course embodying so much of it from the   th century. And so our next interface  which I'll show you  actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity. It's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse the actual museum's collection using facial recognition. So this person's making different faces  and it's actually drawing forth different objects from the collection that connect with exactly how she's looking. And so you can imagine that  as people are performing inside of the museum itself  you get this sense of this emotional connection  this way in which our face connects with the thousands and tens of thousands of years. This is an interface that actually allows you to draw and then draws forth objects using those same shapes. So more and more we're trying to find ways for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves  to be creative even as they're looking at other people's creativity and understanding them. So in this wall  the collections wall  you can actually see all       artworks all at the same time  and you can actually author your own individual walking tours of the museum  so you can share them  and someone can take a tour with the museum director or a tour with their little cousin. But all the while that we've been working on this engagement for Cleveland  we've also been working in the background on really our largest engagement to date  and that's the      Memorial and Museum. So we started in      as part of a team with Thinc Design to create the original master plan for the museum  and then we've done all the media design both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production. So the memorial opened in       and the museum's going to open next year in     . And you can see from these images  the site is so raw and almost archaeological. And of course the event itself is so recent  somewhere between history and current events  it was a huge challenge to imagine how do you actually live up to a space like this  an event like this  to actually tell that story. And so what we started with was really a new way of thinking about building an institution  through a project called Make History  which we launched in     . So it's estimated that a third of the world watched      live  and a third of the world heard about it within    hours  making it really by nature of when it happened  this unprecedented moment of global awareness. And so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world  through video  through photos  through written history  and so people's experiences on that day  which was  in fact  this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this open platform. But that was coupled together with this oral histories booth  really the simplest we've ever made  where you locate yourself on a map. It's in six languages  and you can tell your own story about what happened to you on that day. And when we started seeing the incredible images and stories that came forth from all around the world    this is obviously part of the landing gear    we really started to understand that there was this amazing symmetry between the event itself  between the way that people were telling the stories of the event  and how we ourselves needed to tell that story. This image in particular really captured our attention at the time  because it so much sums up that event. This is a shot from the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. There's a firefighter that's stuck  actually  in traffic  and so the firefighters themselves are running a mile and a half to the site itself with upwards of    pounds of gear on their back. And we got this amazing email that said   While viewing the thousands of photos on the site  I unexpectedly found a photo of my son. It was a shock emotionally  yet a blessing to find this photo   and he was writing because he said   I'd like to personally thank the photographer for posting the photo  as it meant more than words can describe to me to have access to what is probably the last photo ever taken of my son.  And it really made us recognize what this institution needed to be in order to actually tell that story. We can't have just a historian or a curator narrating objectively in the third person about an event like that  when you have the witnesses to history who are going to make their way through the actual museum itself. And so we started imagining the museum  along with the creative team at the museum and the curators  thinking about how the first voice that you would hear inside the museum would actually be of other visitors. And so we created this idea of an opening gallery called We Remember. And I'll just play you part of a mockup of it  but you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter into that moment in time and be transported back in history. Voice    Sur les Champs  lys es    Paris. Voice    In college  at U.C. Berkeley. Voice    I was in Times Square. Voice    S o Paolo  Brazil. Voice    It was probably about    o'clock at night. Voice    I was driving to work at      local time in the morning. Voice    We were actually in a meeting when someone barged in and said   Oh my God  a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center.  Voice     Trying to frantically get to a radio. Voice     When I heard it over the radio    Voice     Heard it on the radio. Voice     I got a call from my father. Voice     The phone rang  it woke me up. My business partner told me to turn on the television. Voice     So I switched on the television. Voice     All channels in Italy were displaying the same thing. Voice     The Twin Towers. Voice     The Twin Towers. JB  And you move from there into that open  cavernous space. This is the so called slurry wall. It's the original  excavated wall at the base of the World Trade Center that withstood the actual pressure from the Hudson River for a full year after the event itself. And so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity  of presence of that moment into the actual exhibition itself. And we tell the stories of being inside the towers through that same audio collage  so you're hearing people literally talking about seeing the planes as they make their way into the building  or making their way down the stairwells. And as you make your way into the exhibition where it talks about the recovery  we actually project directly onto these moments of twisted steel all of the experiences from people who literally excavated on top of the pile itself. And so you can hear oral histories    so people who were actually working the so called bucket brigades as you're seeing literally the thousands of experiences from that moment. And as you leave that storytelling moment understanding about       we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening and actually talk to the individual visitors and ask them their own experiences about     . And we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable  the types of questions that      itself draws forth for all of us. And so these are questions like   How can a democracy balance freedom and security    How could      have happened    And how did the world change after        And so these oral histories  which we've actually been capturing already for years  are then mixed together with interviews that we're doing with people like Donald Rumsfeld  Bill Clinton  Rudy Giuliani  and you mix together these different players and these different experiences  these different reflection points about     . And suddenly the institution  once again  turns into a listening experience. So I'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices  but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event. Voice    It's something that we shared  and it's something that united us. Voice    And I knew when I saw that  people who were there that day who immediately went to help people known and unknown to them was something that would pull us through. Voice    All the outpouring of affection and emotion that came from our country was something really that will forever  ever stay with me. Voice    Still today I pray and think about those who lost their lives  and those who gave their lives to help others  but I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country  the love  the compassIon  the strength  and I watched a nation come together in the middle of a terrible tragedy. JB  And so as people make their way out of the museum  reflecting on the experience  reflecting on their own thoughts of it  they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself  because they've gone back up to grade  and we actually got involved in the memorial after we'd done the museum for a few years. The original designer of the memorial  Michael Arad  had this image in his mind of all the names appearing undifferentiated  almost random  really a poetic reflection on top of the nature of a terrorism event itself  but it was a huge challenge for the families  for the foundation  certainly for the first responders  and there was a negotiation that went forth and a solution was found to actually create not an order in terms of chronology  or in terms of alphabetical  but through what's called meaningful adjacency. So these are groupings of the names themselves which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order  and we  along with Jer Thorp  created an algorithm to take massive amounts of data to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves. So this is an image of the actual algorithm itself with the names scrambled for privacy  but you can see that these blocks of color are actually the four different flights  the two different towers  the first responders  and you can actually see within that different floors  and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections that were requested by the families themselves. And so when you go to the memorial  you can actually see the overarching organization inside of the individual pools themselves. You can see the way that the geography of the event is reflected inside of the memorial  and you can search for an individual name  or in this case an employer  Cantor Fitzgerald  and see the way in which all of those names  those hundreds of names  are actually organized onto the memorial itself  and use that to navigate the memorial. And more importantly  when you're actually at the site of the memorial  you can see those connections. You can see the relationships between the different names themselves. So suddenly what is this undifferentiated  anonymous group of names springs into reality as an individual life. In this case  Harry Ramos  who was the head trader at an investment bank  who stopped to aid Victor Wald on the   th floor of the South Tower. And Ramos told Wald  according to witnesses   I'm not going to leave you.  And Wald's widow requested that they be listed next to each other. Three generations ago  we had to actually get people to go out and capture the stories for common people. Today  of course  there's an unprecedented amount of stories for all of us that are being captured for future generations. And this is our hope  that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories. Thank you very much. When I was about three or four years old  I remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers  and I remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book  to feel the picture they were discussing. And my mum said   Darling  remember that you can't see and you can't feel the picture and you can't feel the print on the page.  And I thought to myself   But that's what I want to do. I love stories. I want to read.  Little did I know that I would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true. I was born premature by about    weeks  which resulted in my blindness  some    years ago. The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia  and it's now very rare in the developed world. Little did I know  lying curled up in my prim baby humidicrib in      that I'd been born at the right place and the right time  that I was in a country where I could participate in the technological revolution. There are    million totally blind people on our planet  but those of us who've shared in the technological changes mainly come from North America  Europe  Japan and other developed parts of the world. Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world  but I think they've changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group. And so I want to tell you about the interaction between computer based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years to become the person I am today. It's an interaction between volunteers  passionate inventors and technology  and it's a story that many other blind people could tell. But let me tell you a bit about it today. When I was five  I went to school and I learned braille. It's an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper  and I can feel them with my fingers. In fact  I think they're putting up my grade six report. I don't know where Julian Morrow got that from. I was pretty good in reading  but religion and musical appreciation needed more work. When you leave the opera house  you'll find there's braille signage in the lifts. Look for it. Have you noticed it  I do. I look for it all the time. When I was at school  the books were transcribed by transcribers  voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so I'd have volumes to read  and that had been going on  mainly by women  since the late   th century in this country  but it was the only way I could read. When I was in high school  I got my first Philips reel to reel tape recorder  and tape recorders became my sort of pre computer medium of learning. I could have family and friends read me material  and I could then read it back as many times as I needed. And it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers. For example  when I studied at graduate school at Queen's University in Canada  the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me. I gave them a tape recorder  and they read into it. As one of them said to me   Ron  we ain't going anywhere at the moment.  But think of it. These men  who hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had  helped me gain post graduate qualifications in law by their dedicated help. Well  I went back and became an academic at Melbourne's Monash University  and for those    years  tape recorders were everything to me. In fact  in my office in       I had    miles of tape. Students  family and friends all read me material. Mrs. Lois Doery  whom I later came to call my surrogate mum  read me many thousands of hours onto tape. One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lois would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her. But sadly  her health hasn't permitted her to come today. But I thank you here  Lois  from this platform. I saw my first Apple computer in       and I thought to myself   This thing's got a glass screen  not much use to me.  How very wrong I was. In       in the month our eldest son Gerard was born  I got my first blind computer  and it's actually here. See it up there  And you see it has no  what do you call it  no screen. It's a blind computer. It's a Keynote Gold   k  and the   k stands for it had    kilobytes of memory. Don't laugh  it cost me       dollars at the time.  Laughter  I think there's more memory in my watch. It was invented by Russell Smith  a passionate inventor in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people. Sadly  he died in a light plane crash in       but his memory lives on in my heart. It meant  for the first time  I could read back what I had typed into it. It had a speech synthesizer. I'd written my first coauthored labor law book on a typewriter in      purely from memory. This now allowed me to read back what I'd written and to enter the computer world  even with its   k of memory. In       the great Ray Kurzweil  the American inventor  worked on building a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech. Optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font  but by using charge coupled device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers  he developed a machine that could read any font. And his machine  which was as big as a washing machine  was launched on the   th of January      . I saw my first commercially available Kurzweil in March       and it blew me away  and in September       the month that my associate professorship at Monash University was announced  the law school got one  and I could use it. For the first time  I could read what I wanted to read by putting a book on the scanner. I didn't have to be nice to people  I no longer would be censored. For example  I was too shy then  and I'm actually too shy now  to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material. But  you know  I could pop a book on in the middle of the night  and    Now  the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop. That's what it's shrunk to. And now I can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries. I can keep up with my friends. There are many people who have helped me in my life  and many that I haven't met. One is another American inventor Ted Henter. Ted was a motorcycle racer  but in      he had a car accident and lost his sight  which is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes. He then turned to being a waterskier and was a champion disabled waterskier. But in       he teamed up with Bill Joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the Net or from what was on the computer. It's called JAWS  Job Access With Speech  and it sounds like this. Ron McCallum  Isn't that slow  You see  if I read like that  I'd fall asleep. I slowed it down for you. I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it. Can we play that one  RM  You know  when you're marking student essays  you want to get through them fairly quickly. This technology that fascinated me in      is now on my iPhone and on yours as well. But  you know  I find reading with machines a very lonely process. I grew up with family  friends  reading to me  and I loved the warmth and the breath and the closeness of people reading. Do you love being read to  And one of my most enduring memories is in       Mary reading to me and the children down near Manly Beach  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.  Isn't that a great book  I still love being close to someone reading to me. But I wouldn't give up the technology  because it's allowed me to lead a great life. Of course  talking books for the blind predated all this technology. After all  the long playing record was developed in the early     s  and now we put talking books on CDs using the digital access system known as DAISY. But when I'm reading with synthetic voices  I love to come home and read a racy novel with a real voice. Now there are still barriers in front of we people with disabilities. Many websites we can't read using JAWS and the other technologies. Websites are often very visual  and there are all these sorts of graphs that aren't labeled and buttons that aren't labeled  and that's why the World Wide Web Consortium    known as W C  has developed worldwide standards for the Internet. And we want all Internet users or Internet site owners to make their sites compatible so that we persons without vision can have a level playing field. There are other barriers brought about by our laws. For example  Australia  like about one third of the world's countries  has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled or read for we blind persons. But those books can't travel across borders. For example  in Spain  there are a         accessible books in Spanish. In Argentina  there are       . In no other Latin American country are there more than a couple of thousand. But it's not legal to transport the books from Spain to Latin America. There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the United States  Britain  Canada  Australia  etc.  but they can't be transported to the    countries in our world where English is the first and the second language. And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter. Well  because we can't transport books across borders  there had to be separate versions read in all the different English speaking countries  Britain  United States  Canada  Australia  and New Zealand all had to have separate readings of Harry Potter. And that's why  next month in Morocco  a meeting is taking place between all the countries. It's something that a group of countries and the World Blind Union are advocating  a cross border treaty so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception  we can transport those books across borders and give life to people  particularly in developing countries  blind people who don't have the books to read. I want that to happen. My life has been extraordinarily blessed with marriage and children and certainly interesting work to do  whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School  where I served a term as dean  or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  in Geneva. I've indeed been a very fortunate human being. I wonder what the future will hold. The technology will advance even further  but I can still remember my mum saying     years ago   Remember  darling  you'll never be able to read the print with your fingers.  I'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers  volunteer readers and passionate inventors  has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me and for blind people throughout the world. I'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin  who is my slide clicker  who clicks the slides  and my wife  Professor Mary Crock  who's the light of my life  is coming on to collect me. I want to thank her too. I think I have to say goodbye now. Bless you. Thank you very much. Yay   Applause  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Applause  So over the long course of human history  the infectious disease that's killed more humans than any other is malaria. It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos  and it's probably our oldest scourge. We may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes. And to this day  malaria takes a huge toll on our species. We've got     million cases a year and over half a million deaths. Now this really makes no sense. We've known how to cure malaria since the     s. That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru discovered the bark of the cinchona tree  and inside that bark was quinine  still an effective cure for malaria to this day. So we've known how to cure malaria for centuries. We've known how to prevent malaria since     . That's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria  not bad air or miasmas  as was previously thought. So malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve  and yet to this day  hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from the bite of a mosquito. Why is that  This is a question that's personally intrigued me for a long time. I grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants visiting my cousins in India every summer  and because I had no immunity to the local malarias  I was made to sleep under this hot  sweaty mosquito net every night while my cousins  they were allowed to sleep out on the terrace and have this nice  cool night breeze wafting over them. And I really hated the mosquitos for that. But at the same time  I come from a Jain family  and Jainism is a religion that espouses a very extreme form of nonviolence. So Jains are not supposed to eat meat. We're not supposed to walk on grass  because you could  you know  inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass. We're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos. So the fearsome power of this little insect was apparent to me from a very young age  and it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist trying to understand  why has malaria been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long  And I think there's three main reasons why. Those three reasons add up to the fourth reason  which is probably the biggest reason of all. The first reason is certainly scientific. This little parasite that causes malaria  it's probably one of the most complex and wily pathogens known to humankind. It lives half its life inside the cold blooded mosquito and half its life inside the warm blooded human. These two environments are totally different  but not only that  they're both utterly hostile. So the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite  and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off. This little creature survives under siege like that  but not only does it survive  it has thrived. It has spread. It has more ways to evade attack than we know. It's a shape shifter  for one thing. Just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly  the malaria parasite transforms itself like that seven times in its life cycle. And each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other  they have totally different physiology. So say you came up with some great drug that worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle. It might do nothing at all to any of the other stages. It can hide in our bodies  undetected  unbeknownst to us  for days  for weeks  for months  for years  in some cases even decades. So the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle  but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite. Only about    species of mosquitos carry most of the world's malaria  and we know quite a bit about the kinds of watery habitats that they specialize in. So you might think  then  well  why don't we just avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live  Right  We could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live. But say you live in the tropics and you walk outside your hut one day and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt around your home. Or say your cow does  or say your pig does  and then  say  it rains  and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water. That's it. You've created the perfect malarial mosquito habitat that's right outside your door. So it's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects. We kind of create places that they love to live just by living our own lives. So there's a huge scientific challenge  but there's a huge economic challenge too. Malaria occurs in some of the poorest and most remote places on Earth  and there's a reason for that. If you're poor  you're more likely to get malaria. If you're poor  you're more likely to live in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained. These are places where mosquitos breed. You're less likely to have door screens or window screens. You're less likely to have electricity and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible  so you're outside more. You're getting bitten by mosquitos more. So poverty causes malaria  but what we also know now is that malaria itself causes poverty. For one thing  it strikes hardest during harvest season  so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields collecting their crops  they're home sick with a fever. But it also predisposes people to death from all other causes. So this has happened historically. We've been able to take malaria out of a society. Everything else stays the same  so we still have bad food  bad water  bad sanitation  all the things that make people sick. But just if you take malaria out  deaths from everything else go down. And the economist Jeff Sachs has actually quantified what this means for a society. What it means is  if you have malaria in your society  your economic growth is depressed by  .  percent every year  year after year after year  just this one disease alone. So this poses a huge economic challenge  because say you do come up with your great drug or your great vaccine    how do you deliver it in a place where there's no roads  there's no infrastructure  there's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold  there's no clinics  there's no clinicians to deliver these things where they're needed  So there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria. But along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge  there's also a cultural challenge  and this is probably the part about malaria that people don't like to talk about. And it's the paradox that the people who have the most malaria in the world tend to care about it the least. This has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again. They ask people in malarious parts of the world   What do you think about malaria   And they don't say   It's a killer disease. We're scared of it.  They say   Malaria is a normal problem of life.  And that was certainly my personal experience. When I told my relatives in India that I was writing a book about malaria  they kind of looked at me like I told them I was writing a book about warts or something. Like  why would you write about something so boring  so ordinary  You know  And it's simple risk perception  really. A child in Malawi  for example  she might have    episodes of malaria before the age of two  but if she survives  she'll continue to get malaria throughout her life  but she's much less likely to die of it. And so in her lived experience  malaria is something that comes and goes. And that's actually true for most of the world's malaria. Most of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own. It's just  there's so much malaria that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death add up to this big  huge number. So I think people in malarious parts of the world must think of malaria the way those of us who live in the temperate world think of cold and flu. Right  Cold and flu have a huge burden on our societies and on our own lives  but we don't really even take the most rudimentary precautions against it because we consider it normal to get cold and flu during cold and flu season. And so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria  because if people think it's normal to have malaria  then how do you get them to run to the doctor to get diagnosed  to pick up their prescription  to get it filled  to take the drugs  to put on the repellents  to tuck in the bed nets  This is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease. So take all that together. We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated  it's economically challenging to deal with  and it's one for which the people who stand to benefit the most care about it the least. And that adds up to the biggest problem of all  which  of course  is the political problem. How do you get a political leader to do anything about a problem like this  And the answer is  historically  you don't. Most malarious societies throughout history have simply lived with the disease. So the main attacks on malaria have come from outside of malarious societies  from people who aren't constrained by these rather paralyzing politics. But this  I think  introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties. The first concerted attack against malaria started in the     s. It was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department. And this effort well understood the economic challenge. They knew they had to focus on cheap  easy to use tools  and they focused on DDT. They understood the cultural challenge. In fact  their rather patronizing view was that people at risk of malaria shouldn't be asked to do anything at all. Everything should be done to them and for them. But they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge. They had so much faith in their tools that they stopped doing malaria research. And so when those tools started to fail  and public opinion started to turn against those tools  they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do. The whole campaign crashed  malaria resurged back  but now it was even worse than before because it was corralled into the hardest to reach places in the most difficult to control forms. One WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign  one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health.  The latest effort to tame malaria started in the late     s. It's similarly directed and financed primarily from outside of malarious societies. Now this effort well understands the scientific challenge. They are doing tons of malaria research. And they understand the economic challenge too. They're focusing on very cheap  very easy to use tools. But now  I think  the dilemma is the cultural challenge. The centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net. It's treated with insecticides. This thing has been distributed across the malarious world by the millions. And when you think about the bed net  it's sort of a surgical intervention. You know  it doesn't really have any value to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria. And yet we're asking people to use these nets every night. They have to sleep under them every night. That's the only way they are effective. And they have to do that even if the net blocks the breeze  even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night and relieve themselves  even if they might have to move all their furnishings to put this thing up  even if  you know  they might live in a round hut in which it's difficult to string up a square net. Now that's no big deal if you're fighting a killer disease. I mean  these are minor inconveniences. But that's not how people with malaria think of malaria. So for them  the calculus must be quite different. Imagine  for example  if a bunch of well meaning Kenyans came up to those of us in the temperate world and said   You know  you people have a lot of cold and flu. We've designed this great  easy to use  cheap tool  we're going to give it to you for free. It's called a face mask  and all you need to do is wear it every day during cold and flu season when you go to school and when you go to work.  Would we do that  And I wonder if that's how people in the malarious world thought of those nets when they first received them  Indeed  we know from studies that only    percent of the bed nets that were first distributed were actually used. And even that's probably an overestimate  because the same people who distributed the nets went back and asked the recipients   Oh  did you use that net I gave you   Which is like your Aunt Jane asking you   Oh  did you use that vase I gave you for Christmas   So it's probably an overestimate. But that's not an insurmountable problem. We can do more education  we can try to convince these people to use the nets. And that's what happening now. We're throwing a lot more time and money into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays and school meetings  all these things to convince people to use the nets we gave you. And that might work. But it takes time. It takes money. It takes resources. It takes infrastructure. It takes all the things that that cheap  easy to use bed net was not supposed to be. So it's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies  but it's equally tricky when we try to attack it from outside of those societies. We end up imposing our own priorities on the people of the malarious world. That's exactly what we did in the     s  and that effort backfired. I would argue today  when we are distributing tools that we've designed and that don't necessarily make sense in people's lives  we run the risk of making the same mistake again. That's not to say that malaria is unconquerable  because I think it is  but what if we attacked this disease according to the priorities of the people who lived with it  Take the example of England and the United States. We had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years  and we got rid of it completely  not because we attacked malaria. We didn't. We attacked bad roads and bad houses and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty. We attacked the malarious way of life  and by doing that  we slowly built malaria out. Now attacking the malarious way of life  this is something    these are things people care about today. And attacking the malarious way of life  it's not fast  it's not cheap  it's not easy  but I think it's the only lasting way forward. Thank you so much. Do you think it's possible to control someone's attention  Even more than that  what about predicting human behavior  I think those are interesting ideas. For me  that would be the perfect superpower  actually kind of an evil way of approaching it. But for myself  in the past  I've spent the last    years studying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way  picking pockets. When we think of misdirection  we think of something as looking off to the side  when actually the things right in front of us are often the hardest to see  the things that you look at every day that you're blinded to. For example  how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now  Great. Double check. Make sure you still have them. I was doing some shopping before. You've looked at them a few times today  but I'll ask you a question. Without looking at it directly yet  can you remember the icon in the bottom right corner  Bring them out  check and see how accurate you were. How'd you do  Show of hands. Did we get it  Now that you're done  close them down. Every phone has something in common. No matter how you organize the icons  you still have a clock on the front. So  without looking at your phone  what time was it  You just looked at your clock  right  Interesting idea. Let's take that a step further with a game of trust. Close your eyes. I realize I'm asking you to do that while you just heard there's a pickpocket in the room  but close your eyes. Now  you've been watching me for about    seconds. With your eyes closed  what am I wearing  Make your best guess. What color is my shirt  What color is my tie  Now open your eyes. Show of hands  were you right  Interesting  isn't it  Some of us are a little bit more perceptive than others  it seems. But I have a different theory about that model of attention. They have fancy models of attention  Posner's trinity model of attention. For me  I like to think of it very simple  like a surveillance system. It's kind of like you have all these fancy sensors  and inside your brain is a little security guard. For me  I like to call him Frank. So Frank is sitting at a desk. He's got lots of cool information in front of him  high tech equipment  he's got cameras  he's got a little phone that he can pick up  listen to the ears  all these senses  all these perceptions. But attention is what steers your perceptions  it's what controls your reality. It's the gateway to the mind. If you don't attend to something  you can't be aware of it. But ironically  you can attend to something without being aware of it. For example  the cocktail effect  You're in a party  having conversations with someone  and yet you can recognize your name without realizing you were listening to that. Now  for my job  I have to play with techniques to exploit this  to play with your attention as a limited resource. So if I could control how you spend your attention  if I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction. Now  instead of doing it like misdirection and throwing it off to the side  instead  what I choose to focus on is Frank  to be able to play with the Frank inside your head  your security guard  and get you  instead of focusing on your external senses  just to go internal for a second. So if I ask you to access a memory  like  what is that  What just happened  Do you have a wallet  Do you have an American Express in your wallet  And when I do that  your Frank turns around. He accesses the file. He has to rewind the tape. What's interesting is  he can't rewind the tape at the same time that he's trying to process new data. This sounds like a good theory  but I could talk for a long time  tell you lots of things  and a portion of them may be true  but I think it's better if I tried to show that to you here live. If I come down  I'm going to do a bit of shopping. Just hold still where you are. Hello  how are you  It's lovely to see you. Wonderful job onstage. Lovely watch  it doesn't come off very well. Do you have a ring as well  Good. Just taking inventory. You're like a buffet. Hard to tell where to start  so many great things. Hi  how are you  Good to see you. Hi  sir  could you stand up  please  Just right where you are. You're married  you follow directions well. Nice to meet you  sir. You don't have a lot in your pockets. Anything down here  Hopefully so. Have a seat. There you go. You're doing well. Hi  sir  how are you  Good to see you  sir. You have a ring  a watch. Do you have a wallet on you  Joe  I don't. AR  Well  we'll find one for you. Come on up this way  Joe. Give Joe a round of applause. Come on up  Joe. Let's play a game. AR  Pardon me. I don't think I need this clicker anymore. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Come on up to the stage  Joe. Let's play a little game now. Anything in your front pockets  J  Money. AR  Money  All right  let's try that. Can you stand right over this way for me  Turn around and  let's see  if I give you something that belongs to me  this is just something I have  a poker chip. Hold out your hand for me. Watch it closely. This is a task for you to focus on. You have your money in your front pocket  J  Yup. AR  Good. I won't put my hand in your pocket. I'm not ready for that kind of commitment. Once a guy had a hole in his pocket  and that was rather traumatizing for me. I wanted his wallet  he gave me his number. Big miscommunication. Let's do this simply. Squeeze your hand tight. Do you feel the poker chip in your hand  J  I do. AR  Would you be surprised if I took it  Say yes. J  Very. AR  Good. Open your hand. Thank you very much. I'll cheat if you give me a chance. Make it harder for me. Just use your hand. Grab my wrist  but squeeze  squeeze firm. Did you see it go  Joe  No. AR  No  it's not here. Open your hand. While we're focused on the hand  it's sitting on your shoulder. Go ahead and take it off. Now  let's try that again. Hold your hand out flat. Open it up. Put your hand up a little bit higher  but watch it close. If I did it slowly  it'd be on your shoulder. Joe  we're going to keep doing this till you catch it. You'll get it eventually. I have faith in you. Squeeze firm. You're human  you're not slow. It's back on your shoulder. You were focused on your hand  distracted. While you were watching  I couldn't get your watch off. Yet you had something inside your pocket. Do you remember what it was  J  Money. AR  Check your pocket. Is it still there  Oh  there it was. Put it away. We're just shopping. This trick's more about the timing. I'm going to try to push it inside your hand. Put your other hand on top  would you  It's amazingly obvious now  isn't it  Looks a lot like the watch I was wearing  doesn't it  J  That's pretty good. AR  Oh  thanks. But it's only a start. Let's try it a little bit differently. Hold your hands together. Your other hand on top. If you're watching this little token  this obviously has become a little target  like a red herring. If we watch this kind of close  it looks like it goes away. It's not back on your shoulder. It falls out of the air  lands right back in the hand. Did you see it go  Yeah  funny. We've got a little guy. He's union  works up there all day. If I do it slowly it goes straight away  it lands by your pocket. Is it in this pocket  sir  Don't reach in your pocket. That's a different show. That's rather strange. They have shots for that. Can I show them  Rather bizarre. Is this yours  sir  I have no idea how that works. We'll send that over there. I need help with this one. Step over this way for me. Don't run away. You had something down by your pants pocket. I was checking mine. I couldn't find everything  but I noticed you had something here. Can I feel the outside for a moment  Down here I noticed this. Is this something of yours  sir  I have no idea. That's a shrimp. J  Yeah. I'm saving it for later. AR  You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way  better than you know. So we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift. Hopefully it matches his taste. We have a couple of other things  a little bit of cash. And we have a few other things  these all belong to you  along with a big round of applause from all your friends. Joe  thank you very much. So  same question I asked you before  but this time you don't have to close your eyes. What am I wearing  Audience  Oh  Attention is a powerful thing. Like I said  it shapes your reality. So  I guess I'd like to pose that question to you. If you could control somebody's attention  what would you do with it  Thank you. I'm going to be showing some of the cybercriminals' latest and nastiest creations. So basically  please don't go and download any of the viruses that I show you. Some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like  and I thought I'd give you a quick insight into my career so far. It's a pretty accurate description. This is what someone that specializes in malware and hacking looks like. So today  computer viruses and trojans  designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your webcam to the theft of billions of dollars. Some malicious code today goes as far as targeting power  utilities and infrastructure. Let me give you a quick snapshot of what malicious code is capable of today. Right now  every second  eight new users are joining the Internet. Today  we will see         individual new computer viruses. We will see        new infected websites. And  just to kind of tear down a myth here  lots of people think that when you get infected with a computer virus  it's because you went to a porn site. Right  Well  actually  statistically speaking  if you only visit porn sites  you're safer. People normally write that down  by the way.  Laughter  Actually  about    percent of these are small business websites getting infected. Today's cybercriminal  what do they look like  Well  many of you have the image  don't you  of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement  hacking away for notoriety. But actually today  cybercriminals are wonderfully professional and organized. In fact  they have product adverts. You can go online and buy a hacking service to knock your business competitor offline. Check out this one I found. and that reason is because you need your business competitors  rivals  haters  or whatever the reason is  or who  they are to go down. Well you  my friend  you've came to the right place. If you want your business competitors to go down  well  they can. If you want your rivals to go offline  well  they will. Not only that  we are providing a short term to long term DDOS service or scheduled attack  starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites to    to    dollars per hour. James Lyne  Now  I did actually pay one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website. Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company. Turns out that's not cool. But regardless  it's amazing how many products and services are available now to cybercriminals. For example  this testing platform  which enables the cybercriminals to test the quality of their viruses before they release them on the world. For a small fee  they can upload it and make sure everything is good. But it goes further. Cybercriminals now have crime packs with business intelligence reporting dashboards to manage the distribution of their malicious code. This is the market leader in malware distribution  the Black Hole Exploit Pack  responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution in the last couple of quarters. It comes with technical installation guides  video setup routines  and get this  technical support. You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you how to set up your illegal hacking server. So let me show you what malicious code looks like today. What I've got here is two systems  an attacker  which I've made look all Matrix y and scary  and a victim  which you might recognize from home or work. Now normally  these would be on different sides of the planet or of the Internet  but I've put them side by side because it makes things much more interesting. Now  there are many ways you can get infected. You will have come in contact with some of them. Maybe some of you have received an email that says something like   Hi  I'm a Nigerian banker  and I'd like to give you    billion dollars because I like your face.  Or funnycats.exe  which rumor has it was quite successful in China's recent campaign against America. Now there are many ways you can get infected. I want to show you a couple of my favorites. This is a little USB key. Now how do you get a USB key to run in a business  Well  you could try looking really cute. Awww. Or  in my case  awkward and pathetic. So imagine this scenario  I walk into one of your businesses  looking very awkward and pathetic  with a copy of my C.V. which I've covered in coffee  and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key and print me a new one. So let's have a look here on my victim computer. What I'm going to do is plug in the USB key. After a couple of seconds  things start to happen on the computer on their own  usually a bad sign. This would  of course  normally happen in a couple of seconds  really  really quickly  but I've kind of slowed it down so you can actually see the attack occurring. Malware is very boring otherwise. So this is writing out the malicious code  and a few seconds later  on the left hand side  you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text. Now if I place the mouse cursor over it  this is what we call a command prompt  and using this we can navigate around the computer. We can access your documents  your data. You can turn on the webcam. That can be very embarrassing. Or just to really prove a point  we can launch programs like my personal favorite  the Windows Calculator. So isn't it amazing how much control the attackers can get with such a simple operation  Let me show you how most malware is now distributed today. What I'm going to do is open up a website that I wrote. It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics. And it's got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website. Many of you will have used something a bit like this before. Unfortunately  when this was implemented  the developer was slightly inebriated and managed to forget all of the secure coding practices he had learned. So let's imagine that our attacker  called Evil Hacker just for comedy value  inserts something a little nasty. This is a script. It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage. So I'm going to submit this post  and then  on my victim computer  I'm going to open up the web browser and browse to my website  www.incrediblyhacked.com. Notice that after a couple of seconds  I get redirected. That website address at the top there  which you can just about see  microshaft.com  the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs  and up pops fake antivirus. This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software  and it will go through and it will scan the system  have a look at what its popping up here. It creates some very serious alerts. Oh look  a child porn proxy server. We really should clean that up. What's really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data  but when the scan finishes  they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses  you have to register the product. Now I liked it better when viruses were free. People now pay cybercriminals money to run viruses  which I find utterly bizarre. So anyway  let me change pace a little bit. Chasing         pieces of malware a day is a massive challenge  and those numbers are only growing directly in proportion to the length of my stress line  you'll note here. So I want to talk to you briefly about a group of hackers we tracked for a year and actually found    and this is a rare treat in our job. Now this was a cross industry collaboration  people from Facebook  independent researchers  guys from Sophos. So here we have a couple of documents which our cybercriminals had uploaded to a cloud service  kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive  like many of you might use. At the top  you'll notice a section of source code. What this would do is send the cybercriminals a text message every day telling them how much money they'd made that day  so a kind of cybercriminal billings report  if you will. If you look closely  you'll notice a series of what are Russian telephone numbers. Now that's obviously interesting  because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals. Down below  highlighted in red  in the other section of source code  is this bit  leded leded.  That's a username  kind of like you might have on Twitter. So let's take this a little further. There are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded. Lots of you here will use smartphones to take photos and post them from the conference. An interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones is that when you take a photo  it embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken. In fact  I've been spending a lot of time on Internet dating sites recently  obviously for research purposes  and I've noticed that about    percent of the profile pictures on Internet dating sites contain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken  which is kind of scary because you wouldn't give out your home address to lots of strangers  but we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates to plus or minus    meters. And our cybercriminals had done the same thing. So here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg. We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool. We used Google. Using the email address  the telephone number and the GPS data  on the left you see an advert for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling  on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens. One of these was more stereotypical for me. A little more searching  and here's our cybercriminal. Imagine  these are hardened cybercriminals sharing information scarcely. Imagine what you could find about each of the people in this room. A bit more searching through the profile and there's a photo of their office. They were working on the third floor. And you can also see some photos from his business companion where he has a taste in a certain kind of image. It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation. But this is where our investigation starts to slow down. The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well. And herein is the greatest lesson of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now. Our friends  our families and our colleagues can break our security even when we do the right things. This is MobSoft  one of the companies that this cybercriminal gang owned  and an interesting thing about MobSoft is the    percent owner of this posted a job advert  and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers from the code earlier. This woman was Maria  and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals. And it's kind of like she went into her social media settings and clicked on every option imaginable to make herself really  really insecure. By the end of the investigation  where you can read the full    page report at that link  we had photos of the cybercriminals  even the office Christmas party when they were out on an outing. That's right  cybercriminals do have Christmas parties  as it turns out. Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys. Let me come back to that in just a minute. I want to change pace to one last little demonstration  a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic  but is interesting in exposing how much information we're all giving away  and it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience. This is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately. Many of you all know about the concept of scanning for wireless networks. You do it every time you take out your iPhone or your Blackberry and connect to something like TEDAttendees. But what you might not know is that you're also beaming out a list of networks you've previously connected to  even when you're not using wireless actively. So I ran a little scan. I was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals  who wouldn't be so concerned by law  and here you can see my mobile device. Okay  So you can see a list of wireless networks. TEDAttendees  HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying  My home network  PrettyFlyForAWifi  which I think is a great name. Sophos Visitors  SANSEMEA  companies I work with. Loganwifi  that's in Boston. HiltonLondon. CIASurveillanceVan. We called it that at one of our conferences because we thought that would freak people out  which is quite fun. This is how geeks party. So let's make this a little bit more interesting. Let's talk about you. Twenty three percent of you have been to Starbucks recently and used the wireless network. Things get more interesting. Forty six percent of you I could link to a business  XYZ Employee network. This isn't an exact science  but it gets pretty accurate. Seven hundred and sixty one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently  absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe. Two hundred and thirty four of you  well  I know where you live. Your wireless network name is so unique that I was able to pinpoint it using data available openly on the Internet with no hacking or clever  clever tricks. And I should mention as well that some of you do use your names   James Lyne's iPhone   for example. And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity. So something for you to think about  As we adopt these new applications and mobile devices  as we play with these shiny new toys  how much are we trading off convenience for privacy and security  Next time you install something  look at the settings and ask yourself   Is this information that I want to share  Would someone be able to abuse it   We also need to think very carefully about how we develop our future talent pool. You see  technology's changing at a staggering rate  and that         pieces of malware won't stay the same for long. There's a very concerning trend that whilst many people coming out of schools now are much more technology savvy  they know how to use technology  fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects to know how that technology works under the covers. In the U.K.  a    percent reduction since       and there are similar statistics all over the world. We also need to think about the legal issues in this area. The cybercriminals I talked about  despite theft of millions of dollars  actually still haven't been arrested  and at this point possibly never will. Most laws are national in their implementation  despite cybercrime conventions  where the Internet is borderless and international by definition. Countries do not agree  which makes this area exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective. But my biggest ask is this  You see  you're going to leave here and you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news. You're going to read about malware doing incredible and terrifying  scary things. However     percent of it works because people fail to do the basics. So my ask is this  Go online  find these simple best practices  find out how to update and patch your computer. Get a secure password. Make sure you use a different password on each of your sites and services online. Find these resources. Apply them. The Internet is a fantastic resource for business  for political expression  for art and for learning. Help me and the security community make life much  much more difficult for cybercriminals. Thank you. This is our life with bees  and this is our life without bees. Bees are the most important pollinators of our fruits and vegetables and flowers and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals. More than one third of the world's crop production is dependent on bee pollination. But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there pollinating our food intentionally. They're out there because they need to eat. Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar. They're flower feeders  and as they move from flower to flower  basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart  they end up providing this valuable pollination service. In parts of the world where there are no bees  or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees  people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand. These people are moving pollen from flower to flower with a paintbrush. Now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon. Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand held vibrator. Now this one's the tomato tickler.  Laughter  Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower  the anther  and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it. So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it  and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note C. So they vibrate the flower  they sonicate it  and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh  and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body  and she takes it home as food. Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pollination when it's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes. So there's other  maybe more personal reasons  to care about bees. There's over        species of bees in the world  and they're absolutely gorgeous. These bees spend the majority of their life cycle hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem and very few of these beautiful species have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees. Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative for the other        plus species because there's something about honeybees that draws people into their world. Humans have been drawn to honeybees since early recorded history  mostly to harvest their honey  which is an amazing natural sweetener. I got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke. I was    years old and bored  and I picked up a book in the library on bees and I spent the night reading it. I had never thought about insects living in complex societies. It was like the best of science fiction come true. And even stranger  there were these people  these beekeepers  that loved their bees like they were family  and when I put down the book  I knew I had to see this for myself. So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper  a family that owned       hives of bees in New Mexico. And I was permanently hooked. Honeybees can be considered a super organism  where the colony is the organism and it's comprised of        to        individual bee organisms. Now this society has no central authority. Nobody's in charge. So how they come to collective decisions  and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor  how they communicate where the flowers are  all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing. My personal favorite  and one that I've studied for many years  is their system of healthcare. So bees have social healthcare. So in my lab  we study how bees keep themselves healthy. For example  we study hygiene  where some bees are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest  from the colony  and it keeps the colony healthy. And more recently  we've been studying resins that bees collect from plants. So bees fly to some plants and they scrape these very  very sticky resins off the leaves  and they take them back to the nest where they cement them into the nest architecture where we call it propolis. We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant. It's a natural antibiotic. It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony  and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity. Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times. We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies for human medicine  but we didn't know how good it was for the bees. So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over    million years. So seven years ago  when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse  first in the United States  it was clear that there was something really  really wrong. In our collective conscience  in a really primal way  we know we can't afford to lose bees. So what's going on  Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes  and I'll go through each of these. The bottom line is  bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape and a dysfunctional food system. Now we have the best data on honeybees  so I'll use them as an example. In the United States  bees in fact have been in decline since World War II. We have half the number of managed hives in the United States now compared to     . We're down to about two million hives of bees  we think. And the reason is  after World War II  we changed our farming practices. We stopped planting cover crops. We stopped planting clover and alfalfa  which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil  and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers. Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees. And after World War II  we started using herbicides to kill off the weeds in our farms. Many of these weeds are flowering plants that bees require for their survival. And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures. Now we talk about food deserts  places in our cities  neighborhoods that have no grocery stores. The very farms that used to sustain bees are now agricultural food deserts  dominated by one or two plant species like corn and soybeans. Since World War II  we have been systematically eliminating many of the flowering plants that bees need for their survival. And these monocultures extend even to crops that are good for bees  like almonds. Fifty years ago  beekeepers would take a few colonies  hives of bees into the almond orchards  for pollination  and also because the pollen in an almond blossom is really high in protein. It's really good for bees. Now  the scale of almond monoculture demands that most of our nation's bees  over  .  million hives of bees  be transported across the nation to pollinate this one crop. And they're trucked in in semi loads  and they must be trucked out  because after bloom  the almond orchards are a vast and flowerless landscape. Bees have been dying over the last    years  and we're planting more crops that need them. There has been a     percent increase in crop production that requires bee pollination. And then there's pesticides. After World War II  we started using pesticides on a large scale  and this became necessary because of the monocultures that put out a feast for crop pests. Recently  researchers from Penn State University have started looking at the pesticide residue in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food  and they've found that every batch of pollen that a honeybee collects has at least six detectable pesticides in it  and this includes every class of insecticides  herbicides  fungicides  and even inert and unlabeled ingredients that are part of the pesticide formulation that can be more toxic than the active ingredient. This small bee is holding up a large mirror. How much is it going to take to contaminate humans  One of these class of insecticides  the neonicontinoids  is making headlines around the world right now. You've probably heard about it. This is a new class of insecticides. It moves through the plant so that a crop pest  a leaf eating insect  would take a bite of the plant and get a lethal dose and die. If one of these neonics  we call them  is applied in a high concentration  such as in this ground application  enough of the compound moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and the nectar  where a bee can consume  in this case  a high dose of this neurotoxin that makes the bee twitch and die. In most agricultural settings  on most of our farms  it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide  and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and nectar  and if a bee consumes this lower dose  either nothing happens or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented and she may not find her way home. And on top of everything else  bees have their own set of diseases and parasites. Public enemy number one for bees is this thing. It's called varroa destructor. It's aptly named. It's this big  blood sucking parasite that compromises the bee's immune system and circulates viruses. Let me put this all together for you. I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a big  bloodsucking parasite running around on it  and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus  but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus  the flu  and I know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition. But what if I lived in a food desert  And what if I had to travel a long distance to get to the grocery store  and I finally got my weak body out there and I consumed  in my food  enough of a pesticide  a neurotoxin  that I couldn't find my way home  And this is what we mean by multiple and interacting causes of death. And it's not just our honeybees. All of our beautiful wild species of bees are at risk  including those tomato pollinating bumblebees. These bees are providing backup for our honeybees. They're providing the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees. We need all of our bees. So what are we going to do  What are we going to do about this big bee bummer that we've created  It turns out  it's hopeful. It's hopeful. Every one of you out there can help bees in two very direct and easy ways. Plant bee friendly flowers  and don't contaminate these flowers  this bee food  with pesticides. So go online and search for flowers that are native to your area and plant them. Plant them in a pot on your doorstep. Plant them in your front yard  in your lawns  in your boulevards. Campaign to have them planted in public gardens  community spaces  meadows. Set aside farmland. We need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season  from spring to fall. We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees  but also for migrating butterflies and birds and other wildlife. And we need to think carefully about putting back in cover crops to nourish our soil and nourish our bees. And we need to diversify our farms. We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt the agricultural food desert and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system that we've created. So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure to a big  huge problem    just go plant flowers    but when bees have access to good nutrition  we have access to good nutrition through their pollination services. And when bees have access to good nutrition  they're better able to engage their own natural defenses  their healthcare  that they have relied on for millions of years. So the beauty of helping bees this way  for me  is that every one of us needs to behave a little bit more like a bee society  an insect society  where each of our individual actions can contribute to a grand solution  an emergent property  that's much greater than the mere sum of our individual actions. So let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large scale change. On behalf of the bees  thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Just a quick question. The latest numbers on the die off of bees  is there any sign of things bottoming out  What's your hope depression level on this  Maria Spivak  Yeah. At least in the United States  an average of    percent of all bee hives are lost every winter. About    years ago  we were at a    percent loss. So it's getting precarious. CA  That's not    percent a year  that's    MS  Yes  thirty percent a year. CA  Thirty percent a year. MS  But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies and so they can maintain the same number  they can recuperate some of their loss. We're kind of at a tipping point. We can't really afford to lose that many more. We need to be really appreciative of all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers. CA  Thank you. Eric Berlow  I'm an ecologist  and Sean's a physicist  and we both study complex networks. And we met a couple years ago when we discovered that we had both given a short TED Talk about the ecology of war  and we realized that we were connected by the ideas we shared before we ever met. And then we thought  you know  there are thousands of other talks out there  especially TEDx Talks  that are popping up all over the world. How are they connected  and what does that global conversation look like  So Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that. Sean Gourley  Exactly. So we took        TEDx Talks from around the world      different countries  and we took these talks and we wanted to find the mathematical structures that underly the ideas behind them. And we wanted to do that so we could see how they connected with each other. And so  of course  if you're going to do this kind of stuff  you need a lot of data. So the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube  and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from YouTube  all the comments  all the views  who's watching it  where are they watching it  what are they saying in the comments. But we can also pull up  using speech to text translation  we can pull the entire transcript  and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself. So we can take their transcript and actually do some pretty cool things. We can take natural language processing algorithms to kind of read through with a computer  line by line  extracting key concepts from this. And we take those key concepts and they sort of form this mathematical structure of an idea. And we call that the meme ome. And the meme ome  you know  quite simply  is the mathematics that underlies an idea  and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it  which I want to share with you now. So each idea has its own meme ome  and each idea is unique with that  but of course  ideas  they borrow from each other  they kind of steal sometimes  and they certainly build on each other  and we can go through mathematically and take the meme ome from one talk and compare it to the meme ome from every other talk  and if there's a similarity between the two of them  we can create a link and represent that as a graph  just like Eric and I are connected. So that's theory  that's great. Let's see how it works in actual practice. So what we've got here now is the global footprint of all the TEDx Talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner. And what we did on this is we analyzed the top    percent of these  and we started to see where the connections occurred  where they connected with each other. Cameron Russell talking about image and beauty connected over into Europe. We've got a bigger conversation about Israel and Palestine radiating outwards from the Middle East. And we've got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint reminiscent of a conversation that is happening everywhere. So from this  we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection  but luckily  computer technology allows us to go out into multidimensional space. So we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this  and the similar talks kind of smash together  and the different ones fly apart  and what we're left with is something quite beautiful. EB  So I want to just point out here that every node is a talk  they're linked if they share similar ideas  and that comes from a machine reading of entire talk transcripts  and then all these topics that pop out  they're not from tags and keywords. They come from the network structure of interconnected ideas. Keep going. SG  Absolutely. So I got a little quick on that  but he's going to slow me down. We've got education connected to storytelling triangulated next to social media. You've got  of course  the human brain right next to healthcare  which you might expect  but also you've got video games  which is sort of adjacent  as those two spaces interface with each other. But I want to take you into one cluster that's particularly important to me  and that's the environment. And I want to kind of zoom in on that and see if we can get a little more resolution. So as we go in here  what we start to see  apply the physics engine again  we see what's one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones. The structure starts to emerge where we see a kind of fractal behavior of the words and the language that we use to describe the things that are important to us all around this world. So you've got food economy and local food at the top  you've got greenhouse gases  solar and nuclear waste. What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations  each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share  creating a broader concept of the environment. And of course  from here  we can go and zoom in and see  well  what are young people looking at  And they're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion. This is their kind of resonance for the conversation around the environment. If we split along gender lines  we can see females resonating heavily with food economy  but also out there in hope and optimism. And so there's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here  and I'll throw to Eric for the next part. EB  Yeah  I mean  just to point out here  you cannot get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on YouTube. Let's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment  and look at all the talks together. Now often  when we're faced with this amount of content  we do a couple of things to simplify it. We might just say  well  what are the most popular talks out there  And a few rise to the surface. There's a talk about gratitude. There's another one about personal health and nutrition. And of course  there's got to be one about porn  right  And so then we might say  well  gratitude  that was last year. What's trending now  What's the popular talk now  And we can see that the new  emerging  top trending topic is about digital privacy. So this is great. It simplifies things. But there's so much creative content that's just buried at the bottom. And I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface that's maybe really creative and interesting  Well  we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that. Remember  it's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics  and let's say we could take two of them  like cities and genetics  and say  well  are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines. And that's    Essentially  this kind of creative remix is one of the hallmarks of innovation. Well here's one by Jessica Green about the microbial ecology of buildings. It's literally defining a new field. And we could go back to those topics and say  well  what talks are central to those conversations  In the cities cluster  one of the most central was one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities  and in the genetics cluster  we have a talk about synthetic biology by Craig Venter. These are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline. We could go the other direction and say  well  what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields. We used a measure of ecological diversity to get this. Like  a talk by Steven Pinker on the history of violence  very synthetic. And then  of course  there are talks that are so unique they're kind of out in the stratosphere  in their own special place  and we call that the Colleen Flanagan index. And if you don't know Colleen  she's an artist  and I asked her   Well  what's it like out there in the stratosphere of our idea space   And apparently it smells like bacon. I wouldn't know. So we're using these network motifs to find talks that are unique  ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields  ones that are central to their topic  and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields. Okay  We never would have found those with our obsession with what's trending now. And all of this comes from the architecture of complexity  or the patterns of how things are connected. SG  So that's exactly right. We've got ourselves in a world that's massively complex  and we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it. And those algorithms  whilst being kind of useful  are also very  very narrow  and we can do better than that  because we can realize that their complexity is not random. It has mathematical structure  and we can use that mathematical structure to go and explore things like the world of ideas to see what's being said  to see what's not being said  and to be a little bit more human and  hopefully  a little smarter. Thank you. When my father and I started a company to  D print human tissues and organs  some people initially thought we were a little crazy. But since then  much progress has been made  both in our lab and other labs around the world. And given this  we started getting questions like   If you can grow human body parts  can you also grow animal products like meat and leather   When someone first suggested this to me  quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy  but what I soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all. What's crazy is what we do today. I'm convinced that in    years  when we look back on today and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals to make our hamburgers and our handbags  we'll see this as being wasteful and indeed crazy. Did you know that today we maintain a global herd of    billion animals to provide our meat  dairy  eggs and leather goods  And over the next few decades  as the world's population expands to    billion  this will need to nearly double to     billion animals. But maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet. Animals are not just raw materials. They're living beings  and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land  fresh water  and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases which drive climate change. On top of this  when you get so many animals so close together  it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse. Clearly  we cannot continue on this path which puts the environment  public health  and food security at risk. There is another way  because essentially  animal products are just collections of tissues  and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues. What if  instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal  we started with what the tissues are made of  the basic unit of life  the cell  This is biofabrication  where cells themselves can be used to grow biological products like tissues and organs. Already in medicine  biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts  like ears  windpipes  skin  blood vessels and bone  that have been successfully implanted into patients. And beyond medicine  biofabrication can be a humane  sustainable and scalable new industry. And we should begin by reimagining leather. I emphasize leather because it is so widely used. It is beautiful  and it has long been a part of our history. Growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat. It mainly uses one cell type  and it is largely two dimensional. It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators. Until biofabrication is better understood  it is clear that  initially at least  more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat novel foods  no matter how delicious. In this sense  leather is a gateway material  a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry. If we can succeed here  it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon. Now how do we do it  To grow leather  we begin by taking cells from an animal  through a simple biopsy. The animal could be a cow  lamb  or even something more exotic. This process does no harm  and Daisy the cow can live a happy life. We then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium. This takes millions of cells and expands them into billions. And we then coax these cells to produce collagen  as they would naturally. This collagen is the stuff between cells. It's natural connective tissue. It's the extracellular matrix  but in leather  it's the main building block. And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets  and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another  like phyllo pastry  to form thicker sheets  which we then let mature. And finally  we take this multilayered skin and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process  we create leather. And so I'm very excited to show you  for the first time  the first batch of our cultured leather  fresh from the lab. This is real  genuine leather  without the animal sacrifice. It can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells  and better yet  there is no hair to remove  no scars or insect's bites  and no waste. This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet  a handbag or a car seat. It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator. And because we make this material  we grow this leather from the ground up  we can control its properties in very interesting ways. This piece of leather is a mere seven tissue layers thick  and as you can see  it is nearly transparent. And this leather is    layers thick and quite opaque. You don't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather. And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities  like softness  breathability  durability  elasticity and even things like pattern. We can mimic nature  but in some ways also improve upon it. This type of leather can do what today's leather does  but with imagination  probably much more. What could the future of animal products look like  It need not look like this  which is actually the state of the art today. Rather  it could be much more like this. Already  we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years  beginning with products like wine  beer and yogurt. And speaking of food  our cultured food has evolved  and today we prepare cultured food in beautiful  sterile facilities like this. A brewery is essentially a bioreactor. It is where cell culture takes place. Imagine that in this facility  instead of brewing beer  we were brewing leather or meat. Imagine touring this facility  learning about how the leather or meat is cultured  seeing the process from beginning to end  and even trying some. It's clean  open and educational  and this is in contrast to the hidden  guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today. Perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind. It's environmentally responsible  efficient and humane. It allows us to be creative. We can design new materials  new products  and new facilities. We need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved. Perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured. Thank you. Democracy is in trouble  no question about that  and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded. It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions we face that have to do with global pandemics  a cross border problem  with HIV  a transnational problem  with markets and immigration  something that goes beyond national borders  with terrorism  with war  all now cross border problems. In fact  we live in a   st century world of interdependence  and brutal interdependent problems  and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy  we are faced with political institutions designed     years ago  autonomous  sovereign nation states with jurisdictions and territories separate from one another  each claiming to be able to solve the problem of its own people. Twenty first century  transnational world of problems and challenges    th century world of political institutions. In that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy. And like many others  I've been thinking about what can one do about this  this asymmetry between   st century challenges and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional political institutions like nation states. And my suggestion is that we change the subject  that we stop talking about nations  about bordered states  and we start talking about cities. Because I think you will find  when we talk about cities  we are talking about the political institutions in which civilization and culture were born. We are talking about the cradle of democracy. We are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together to create democracy  and at the same time protest those who would take our freedom  take place. Think of some great names  the Place de la Bastille  Zuccotti Park  Tahrir Square  Taksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul  or  yes  Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Those are the public spaces where we announce ourselves as citizens  as participants  as people with the right to write our own narratives. Cities are not only the oldest of institutions  they're the most enduring. If you think about it  Constantinople  Istanbul  much older than Turkey. Alexandria  much older than Egypt. Rome  far older than Italy. Cities endure the ages. They are the places where we are born  grow up  are educated  work  marry  pray  play  get old  and in time  die. They are home. Very different than nation states  which are abstractions. We pay taxes  we vote occasionally  we watch the men and women we choose rule rule more or less without us. Not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live. Moreover  today  more than half of the world's population live in cities. In the developed world  it's about    percent. More than three out of four people live in urban institutions  urban places  in cities today. So cities are where the action is. Cities are us. Aristotle said in the ancient world  man is a political animal. I say we are an urban animal. We are an urban species  at home in our cities. So to come back to the dilemma  if the dilemma is we have old fashioned political nation states unable to govern the world  respond to the global challenges that we face like climate change  then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world  for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent to engage in global governance. When I say if mayors ruled the world  when I first came up with that phrase  it occurred to me that actually  they already do. There are scores of international  inter city  cross border institutions  networks of cities in which cities are already  quite quietly  below the horizon  working together to deal with climate change  to deal with security  to deal with immigration  to deal with all of those tough  interdependent problems that we face. They have strange names  UCLG  United Cities and Local Governments  ICLEI  the International Council for Local Environmental Issues. And the list goes on  Citynet in Asia  City Protocol  a new organization out of Barcelona that is using the web to share best practices among countries. And then all the things we know a little better  the U.S. Conference of Mayors  the Mexican Conference of Mayors  the European Conference of Mayors. Mayors are where this is happening. And so the question is  how can we create a world in which mayors and the citizens they represent play a more prominent role  Well  to understand that  we need to understand why cities are special  why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents  because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum. To be a prime minister or a president  you have to have an ideology  you have to have a meta narrative  you have to have a theory of how things work  you have to belong to a party. Independents  on the whole  don't get elected to office. But mayors are just the opposite. Mayors are pragmatists  they're problem solvers. Their job is to get things done  and if they don't  they're out of a job. Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said  we could never get away here in Philadelphia with the stuff that goes on in Washington  the paralysis  the non action  the inaction. Why  Because potholes have to get filled  because the trains have to run  because kids have to be able to get to school. And that's what we have to do  and to do that is about pragmatism in that deep  American sense  reaching outcomes. Washington  Beijing  Paris  as world capitals  are anything but pragmatic  but real city mayors have to be pragmatists. They have to get things done  they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside and draw their cities together. We saw this a couple of decades ago when Teddy Kollek  the great mayor of Jerusalem in the '  s and the '  s  was besieged one day in his office by religious leaders from all of the backgrounds  Christian prelates  rabbis  imams. They were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites. And the squabble went on and on  and Kollek listened and listened  and he finally said   Gentlemen  spare me your sermons  and I will fix your sewers.  That's what mayors do. They fix sewers  they get the trains running. There isn't a left or a right way of doing. Boris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho Tory. Strange term  but in some ways  he is. He's a libertarian. He's an anarchist. He rides to work on a bike  but at the same time  he's in some ways a conservative. Bloomberg in New York was a Democrat  then he was a Republican  and finally he was an Independent  and said the party label just gets in the way. Luzhkov     years mayor in Moscow  though he helped found a party  United Party with Putin  in fact refused to be defined by the party and finally  in fact  lost his job not under Brezhnev  not under Gorbachev  but under Putin  who wanted a more faithful party follower. So mayors are pragmatists and problem solvers. They get things done. But the second thing about mayors is they are also what I like to call homeboys  or to include the women mayors  homies. They're from the neighborhood. They're part of the neighborhood. They're known. Ed Koch used to wander around New York City saying   How am I doing   Imagine David Cameron wandering around the United Kingdom asking   How am I doing   He wouldn't like the answer. Or Putin. Or any national leader. He could ask that because he knew New Yorkers and they knew him. Mayors are usually from the places they govern. It's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor. You can run for the Senate out of a different state  but it's hard to do that as a mayor. And as a result  mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level  and this is the third feature about mayors  than national governing officials. In the United States  we know the pathetic figures     percent of Americans approve of Congress and what they do. And even with a relatively popular president like Obama  the figures for the Presidency run about         sometimes    percent at best. The Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be. But when you ask   Do you trust your city councillor  do you trust your mayor   the rates shoot up to         even    percent  because they're from the neighborhood  because the people they work with are their neighbors  because  like Mayor Booker in Newark  a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work and go in and pull people out of a burning building    that happened to Mayor Booker    or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work because he sees it. No head of state would be permitted by their security details to do it  nor be in a position to do it. That's the difference  and the difference has to do with the character of cities themselves  because cities are profoundly multicultural  open  participatory  democratic  able to work with one another. When states face each other  China and the U.S.  they face each other like this. When cities interact  they interact like this. China and the U.S.  despite the recent meta meeting in California  are locked in all kinds of anger  resentment  and rivalry for number one. We heard more about who will be number one. Cities don't worry about number one. They have to work together  and they do work together. They work together in climate change  for example. Organizations like the C    like ICLEI  which I mentioned  have been working together many  many years before Copenhagen. In Copenhagen  four or five years ago      nations came together to explain to one another why their sovereignty didn't permit them to deal with the grave  grave crisis of climate change  but the mayor of Copenhagen had invited     mayors to attend. They came  they stayed  and they found ways and are still finding ways to work together  city to city  and through inter city organizations. Eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities  which means cities are in a position to solve the carbon problem  or most of it  whether or not the states of which they are a part make agreements with one another. And they are doing it. Los Angeles cleaned up its port  which was    percent of carbon emissions  and as a result got rid of about    percent of carbon. New York has a program to upgrade its old buildings  make them better insulated in the winter  to not leak energy in the summer  not leak air conditioning. That's having an impact. Bogota  where Mayor Mockus  when he was mayor  he introduced a transportation system that saved energy  that allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways  express buses with corridors. It helped unemployment  because people could get across town  and it had a profound impact on climate as well as many other things there. Singapore  as it developed its high rises and its remarkable public housing  also developed an island of parks  and if you go there  you'll see how much of it is green land and park land. Cities are doing this  but not just one by one. They are doing it together. They are sharing what they do  and they are making a difference by shared best practices. Bike shares  many of you have heard of it  started    or    years ago in Latin America. Now it's in hundreds of cities around the world. Pedestrian zones  congestion fees  emission limits in cities like California cities have  there's lots and lots that cities can do even when opaque  stubborn nations refuse to act. So what's the bottom line here  The bottom line is  we still live politically in a world of borders  a world of boundaries  a world of walls  a world where states refuse to act together. Yet we know that the reality we experience day to day is a world without borders  a world of diseases without borders and doctors without borders  maladies sans fronti res  M decins Sans Fronti res  of economics and technology without borders  of education without borders  of terrorism and war without borders. That is the real world  and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or democratize globalization  we will increasingly not only risk the failure to address all of these transnational problems  but we will risk losing democracy itself  locked up in the old nation state box  unable to address global problems democratically. So where does that leave us  I'll tell you. The road to global democracy doesn't run through states. It runs through cities. Democracy was born in the ancient polis. I believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis. In that journey from polis to cosmopolis  we can rediscover the power of democracy on a global level. We can create not a League of Nations  which failed  but a League of Cities  not a United or a dis United Nations  but United Cities of the World. We can create a global parliament of mayors. That's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world  but it's also on the table in City Halls in Seoul  Korea  in Amsterdam  in Hamburg  and in New York. Mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually constitute a global parliament of mayors  and I love that idea  because a parliament of mayors is a parliament of citizens and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us  of you and of me. If ever there were citizens without borders  I think it's the citizens of TED who show the promise to be those citizens without borders. I am ready to reach out and embrace a new global democracy  to take back our democracy. And the only question is  are you  Thank you so much  my fellow citizens. Thank you.  Applause  I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on involving a man named Steve Titus. Titus was a restaurant manager. He was    years old  he lived in Seattle  Washington  he was engaged to Gretchen  about to be married  she was the love of his life. And one night  the couple went out for a romantic restaurant meal. They were on their way home  and they were pulled over by a police officer. You see  Titus' car sort of resembled a car that was driven earlier in the evening by a man who raped a female hitchhiker  and Titus kind of resembled that rapist. So the police took a picture of Titus  they put it in a photo lineup  they later showed it to the victim  and she pointed to Titus' photo. She said   That one's the closest.  The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial  and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape  the rape victim got on the stand and said   I'm absolutely positive that's the man.  And Titus was convicted. He proclaimed his innocence  his family screamed at the jury  his fianc e collapsed on the floor sobbing  and Titus is taken away to jail. So what would you do at this point  What would you do  Well  Titus lost complete faith in the legal system  and yet he got an idea. He called up the local newspaper  he got the interest of an investigative journalist  and that journalist actually found the real rapist  a man who ultimately confessed to this rape  a man who was thought to have committed    rapes in that area  and when this information was given to the judge  the judge set Titus free. And really  that's where this case should have ended. It should have been over. Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year  a year of accusation and trial  but over. It didn't end that way. Titus was so bitter. He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back. He lost his fianc e. She couldn't put up with his persistent anger. He lost his entire savings  and so he decided to file a lawsuit against the police and others whom he felt were responsible for his suffering. And that's when I really started working on this case  trying to figure out how did that victim go from  That one's the closest  to  I'm absolutely positive that's the guy.  Well  Titus was consumed with his civil case. He spent every waking moment thinking about it  and just days before he was to have his day in court  he woke up in the morning  doubled over in pain  and died of a stress related heart attack. He was    years old. So I was asked to work on Titus' case because I'm a psychological scientist. I study memory. I've studied memory for decades. And if I meet somebody on an airplane    this happened on the way over to Scotland    if I meet somebody on an airplane  and we ask each other   What do you do  What do you do   and I say  I study memory   they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names  or they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's or some kind of memory problem  but I have to tell them I don't study when people forget. I study the opposite  when they remember  when they remember things that didn't happen or remember things that were different from the way they really were. I study false memories. Unhappily  Steve Titus is not the only person to be convicted based on somebody's false memory. In one project in the United States  information has been gathered on     innocent people      defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do. They spent            years in prison for these crimes  and now DNA testing has proven that they are actually innocent. And when those cases have been analyzed  three quarters of them are due to faulty memory  faulty eyewitness memory. Well  why  Like the jurors who convicted those innocent people and the jurors who convicted Titus  many people believe that memory works like a recording device. You just record the information  then you call it up and play it back when you want to answer questions or identify images. But decades of work in psychology has shown that this just isn't true. Our memories are constructive. They're reconstructive. Memory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page  You can go in there and change it  but so can other people. I first started studying this constructive memory process in the     s. I did my experiments that involved showing people simulated crimes and accidents and asking them questions about what they remember. In one study  we showed people a simulated accident and we asked people  how fast were the cars going when they hit each other  And we asked other people  how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other  And if we asked the leading  smashed  question  the witnesses told us the cars were going faster  and moreover  that leading  smashed  question caused people to be more likely to tell us that they saw broken glass in the accident scene when there wasn't any broken glass at all. In another study  we showed a simulated accident where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign  and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign  many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign at the intersection  not a stop sign. And you might be thinking  well  you know  these are filmed events  they are not particularly stressful. Would the same kind of mistakes be made with a really stressful event  In a study we published just a few months ago  we have an answer to this question  because what was unusual about this study is we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience. The subjects in this study were members of the U.S. military who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise to teach them what it's going to be like for them if they are ever captured as prisoners of war. And as part of this training exercise  these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive  hostile  physically abusive fashion for    minutes and later on they have to try to identify the person who conducted that interrogation. And when we feed them suggestive information that insinuates it's a different person  many of them misidentify their interrogator  often identifying someone who doesn't even remotely resemble the real interrogator. And so what these studies are showing is that when you feed people misinformation about some experience that they may have had  you can distort or contaminate or change their memory. Well out there in the real world  misinformation is everywhere. We get misinformation not only if we're questioned in a leading way  but if we talk to other witnesses who might consciously or inadvertently feed us some erroneous information  or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced  all of these provide the opportunity for this kind of contamination of our memory. In the     s  we began to see an even more extreme kind of memory problem. Some patients were going into therapy with one problem    maybe they had depression  an eating disorder    and they were coming out of therapy with a different problem. Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations  sometimes in satanic rituals  sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements. One woman came out of psychotherapy believing that she'd endured years of ritualistic abuse  where she was forced into a pregnancy and that the baby was cut from her belly. But there were no physical scars or any kind of physical evidence that could have supported her story. And when I began looking into these cases  I was wondering  where do these bizarre memories come from  And what I found is that most of these situations involved some particular form of psychotherapy. And so I asked  were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy    like the imagination exercises or dream interpretation  or in some cases hypnosis  or in some cases exposure to false information    were these leading these patients to develop these very bizarre  unlikely memories  And I designed some experiments to try to study the processes that were being used in this psychotherapy so I could study the development of these very rich false memories. In one of the first studies we did  we used suggestion  a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases  we used this kind of suggestion and planted a false memory that when you were a kid  five or six years old  you were lost in a shopping mall. You were frightened. You were crying. You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person and reunited with the family. And we succeeded in planting this memory in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects. And you might be thinking  well  that's not particularly stressful. But we and other investigators have planted rich false memories of things that were much more unusual and much more stressful. So in a study done in Tennessee  researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid  you nearly drowned and had to be rescued by a life guard. And in a study done in Canada  researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid  something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal happened to you  succeeding with about half of their subjects. And in a study done in Italy  researchers planted the false memory  when you were a kid  you witnessed demonic possession. I do want to add that it might seem like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects in the name of science  but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation by research ethics boards that have made the decision that the temporary discomfort that some of these subjects might experience in these studies is outweighed by the importance of this problem for understanding memory processes and the abuse of memory that is going on in some places in the world. Well  to my surprise  when I published this work and began to speak out against this particular brand of psychotherapy  it created some pretty bad problems for me  hostilities  primarily from the repressed memory therapists  who felt under attack  and by the patients whom they had influenced. I had sometimes armed guards at speeches that I was invited to give  people trying to drum up letter writing campaigns to get me fired. But probably the worst was I suspected that a woman was innocent of abuse that was being claimed by her grown daughter. She accused her mother of sexual abuse based on a repressed memory. And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story to be filmed and presented in public places. I was suspicious of this story  and so I started to investigate  and eventually found information that convinced me that this mother was innocent. I published an expos  on the case  and a little while later  the accusing daughter filed a lawsuit. Even though I'd never mentioned her name  she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy. And I went through nearly five years of dealing with this messy  unpleasant litigation  but finally  finally  it was over and I could really get back to my work. In the process  however  I became part of a disturbing trend in America where scientists are being sued for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy. When I got back to my work  I asked this question  if I plant a false memory in your mind  does it have repercussions  Does it affect your later thoughts  your later behaviors  Our first study planted a false memory that you got sick as a child eating certain foods  hard boiled eggs  dill pickles  strawberry ice cream. And we found that once we planted this false memory  people didn't want to eat the foods as much at an outdoor picnic. The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant. If we planted a warm  fuzzy memory involving a healthy food like asparagus  we could get people to want to eat asparagus more. And so what these studies are showing is that you can plant false memories and they have repercussions that affect behavior long after the memories take hold. Well  along with this ability to plant memories and control behavior obviously come some important ethical issues  like  when should we use this mind technology  And should we ever ban its use  Therapists can't ethically plant false memories in the mind of their patients even if it would help the patient  but there's nothing to stop a parent from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager. And when I suggested this publicly  it created an outcry again.  There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children.  Hello  Santa Claus.  Laughter  I mean  another way to think about this is  which would you rather have  a kid with obesity  diabetes  shortened lifespan  all the things that go with it  or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory  I know what I would choose for a kid of mine. But maybe my work has made me different from most people. Most people cherish their memories  know that they represent their identity  who they are  where they came from. And I appreciate that. I feel that way too. But I know from my work how much fiction is already in there. If I've learned anything from these decades of working on these problems  it's this  just because somebody tells you something and they say it with confidence  just because they say it with lots of detail  just because they express emotion when they say it  it doesn't mean that it really happened. We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories. We need independent corroboration. Such a discovery has made me more tolerant of the everyday memory mistakes that my friends and family members make. Such a discovery might have saved Steve Titus  the man whose whole future was snatched away by a false memory. But meanwhile  we should all keep in mind  we'd do well to  that memory  like liberty  is a fragile thing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thanks very much.  Applause  There is an ancient proverb that says it's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room  especially when there is no cat. I find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works    bumbling around in a dark room  bumping into things  trying to figure out what shape this might be  what that might be  there are reports of a cat somewhere around  they may not be reliable  they may be  and so forth and so on. Now I know this is different than the way most people think about science. Science  we generally are told  is a very well ordered mechanism for understanding the world  for gaining facts  for gaining data  that it's rule based  that scientists use this thing called the scientific method and we've been doing this for    generations or so now  and the scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard  cold facts out of the data. I'd like to tell you that's not the case. So there's the scientific method  but what's really going on is this.  Laughter   The Scientific Method vs. Farting Around  And it's going on kind of like that.  ... in the dark   Laughter  So what is the difference  then  between the way I believe science is pursued and the way it seems to be perceived  So this difference first came to me in some ways in my dual role at Columbia University  where I'm both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience where we try to figure out how the brain works. We do this by studying the sense of smell  the sense of olfaction  and in the laboratory  it's a great pleasure and fascinating work and exciting to work with graduate students and post docs and think up cool experiments to understand how this sense of smell works and how the brain might be working  and  well  frankly  it's kind of exhilarating. But at the same time  it's my responsibility to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain  and that's a big subject  and it takes quite a while to organize that  and it's quite challenging and it's quite interesting  but I have to say  it's not so exhilarating. So what was the difference  Well  the course I was and am teaching is called Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience   I.  Laughs  It's    lectures full of all sorts of facts  it uses this giant book called  Principles of Neural Science  by three famous neuroscientists. This book comes in at       pages  it weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds. Just to put that in some perspective  that's the weight of two normal human brains. So I began to realize  by the end of this course  that the students maybe were getting the idea that we must know everything there is to know about the brain. That's clearly not true. And they must also have this idea  I suppose  that what scientists do is collect data and collect facts and stick them in these big books. And that's not really the case either. When I go to a meeting  after the meeting day is over and we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues  we never talk about what we know. We talk about what we don't know. We talk about what still has to get done  what's so critical to get done in the lab. Indeed  this was  I think  best said by Marie Curie who said that one never notices what has been done but only what remains to be done. This was in a letter to her brother after obtaining her second graduate degree  I should say. I have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie  because I am convinced that that glow behind her is not a photographic effect.  Laughter  That's the real thing. It is true that her papers are  to this day  stored in a basement room in the Biblioth que Fran aise in a concrete room that's lead lined  and if you're a scholar and you want access to these notebooks  you have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit  so it's pretty scary business. Nonetheless  this is what I think we were leaving out of our courses and leaving out of the interaction that we have with the public as scientists  the what remains to be done. This is the stuff that's exhilarating and interesting. It is  if you will  the ignorance. That's what was missing. So I thought  well  maybe I should teach a course on ignorance  something I can finally excel at  perhaps  for example. So I did start teaching this course on ignorance  and it's been quite interesting and I'd like to tell you to go to the website. You can find all sorts of information there. It's wide open. And it's been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about what it is they don't know. Now I use this word  ignorance   of course  to be at least in part intentionally provocative  because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and I clearly don't mean any of those. So I don't mean stupidity  I don't mean a callow indifference to fact or reason or data. The ignorant are clearly unenlightened  unaware  uninformed  and present company today excepted  often occupy elected offices  it seems to me. That's another story  perhaps. I mean a different kind of ignorance. I mean a kind of ignorance that's less pejorative  a kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge  something that's just not there to be known or isn't known well enough yet or we can't make predictions from  the kind of ignorance that's maybe best summed up in a statement by James Clerk Maxwell  perhaps the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein  who said   Thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real advance in science.  I think it's a wonderful idea  thoroughly conscious ignorance. So that's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today  but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts  So it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate. We all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts  this accumulation model of science  as many have called it  and it seems impregnable  it seems impossible. How can you ever know all of this  And indeed  the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate. In       there were  .  million papers published. There's about a two and a half percent yearly growth rate  and so last year we saw over one and a half million papers being published. Divide that by the number of minutes in a year  and you wind up with three new papers per minute. So I've been up here a little over    minutes  I've already lost three papers. I have to get out of here actually. I have to go read. So what do we do about this  Well  the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect  if you will. We just don't worry about it  in a way. The facts are important. You have to know a lot of stuff to be a scientist. That's true. But knowing a lot of stuff doesn't make you a scientist. You need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter. But in science  knowing a lot of stuff is not the point. Knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get to more ignorance. So knowledge is a big subject  but I would say ignorance is a bigger one. So this leads us to maybe think about  a little bit about  some of the models of science that we tend to use  and I'd like to disabuse you of some of them. So one of them  a popular one  is that scientists are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together to reveal some grand scheme or another. This is clearly not true. For one  with puzzles  the manufacturer has guaranteed that there's a solution. We don't have any such guarantee. Indeed  there are many of us who aren't so sure about the manufacturer. So I think the puzzle model doesn't work. Another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things the way you unravel the peels of an onion. So peel by peel  you take away the layers of the onion to get at some fundamental kernel of truth. I don't think that's the way it works either. Another one  a kind of popular one  is the iceberg idea  that we only see the tip of the iceberg but underneath is where most of the iceberg is hidden. But all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts that we can somehow or another get completed. We can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is  or we could just wait for it to melt  I suppose  these days  but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg. Right  Or make it manageable. But I don't think that's the case. I think what really happens in science is a model more like the magic well  where no matter how many buckets you take out  there's always another bucket of water to be had  or my particularly favorite one  with the effect and everything  the ripples on a pond. So if you think of knowledge being this ever expanding ripple on a pond  the important thing to realize is that our ignorance  the circumference of this knowledge  also grows with knowledge. So the knowledge generates ignorance. This is really well said  I thought  by George Bernard Shaw. This is actually part of a toast that he delivered to celebrate Einstein at a dinner celebrating Einstein's work  in which he claims that science just creates more questions than it answers.   Science is always wrong. It never solves a problem without creating    more.   I find that kind of glorious  and I think he's precisely right  plus it's a kind of job security. As it turns out  he kind of cribbed that from the philosopher Immanuel Kant who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea of question propagation  that every answer begets more questions. I love that term   question propagation   this idea of questions propagating out there. So I'd say the model we want to take is not that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together and then we gain knowledge. It's rather kind of the other way around  really. What do we use this knowledge for  What are we using this collection of facts for  We're using it to make better ignorance  to come up with  if you will  higher quality ignorance. Because  you know  there's low quality ignorance and there's high quality ignorance. It's not all the same. Scientists argue about this all the time. Sometimes we call them bull sessions. Sometimes we call them grant proposals. But nonetheless  it's what the argument is about. It's the ignorance. It's the what we don't know. It's what makes a good question. So how do we think about these questions  I'm going to show you a graph that shows up quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments. This graph asks the relationship between what you know and how much you know about it. So what you know  you can know anywhere from nothing to everything  of course  and how much you know about it can be anywhere from a little to a lot. So let's put a point on the graph. There's an undergraduate. Doesn't know much but they have a lot of interest. They're interested in almost everything. Now you look at a master's student  a little further along in their education  and you see they know a bit more  but it's been narrowed somewhat. And finally you get your Ph.D.  where it turns out you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing.  Laughter  What's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that because  of course  when it dips below the zero axis  there  it gets into a negative area. That's where you find people like me  I'm afraid. So the important thing here is that this can all be changed. This whole view can be changed by just changing the label on the x axis. So instead of how much you know about it  we could say   What can you ask about it   So yes  you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist  but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff is not just to know a lot of stuff. That just makes you a geek  right  Knowing a lot of stuff  the purpose is to be able to ask lots of questions  to be able to frame thoughtful  interesting questions  because that's where the real work is. Let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions. I'm a neuroscientist  so how would we come up with a question in neuroscience  Because it's not always quite so straightforward. So  for example  we could say  well what is it that the brain does  Well  one thing the brain does  it moves us around. We walk around on two legs. That seems kind of simple  somehow or another. I mean  virtually everybody over    months of age walks around on two legs  right  So that maybe is not that interesting. So instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at. How about the visual system  There it is  the visual system. I mean  we love our visual systems. We do all kinds of cool stuff. Indeed  there are over        neuroscientists who work on the visual system  from the retina to the visual cortex  in an attempt to understand not just the visual system but to also understand how general principles of how the brain might work. But now here's the thing  Our technology has actually been pretty good at replicating what the visual system does. We have TV  we have movies  we have animation  we have photography  we have pattern recognition  all of these sorts of things. They work differently than our visual systems in some cases  but nonetheless we've been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system. Somehow or another  a hundred years of robotics  you never saw a robot walk on two legs  because robots don't walk on two legs because it's not such an easy thing to do. A hundred years of robotics  and we can't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other. You ask them to go up an inclined plane  and they fall over. Turn around  and they fall over. It's a serious problem. So what is it that's the most difficult thing for a brain to do  What ought we to be studying  Perhaps it ought to be walking on two legs  or the motor system. I'll give you an example from my own lab  my own particularly smelly question  since we work on the sense of smell. But here's a diagram of five molecules and sort of a chemical notation. These are just plain old molecules  but if you sniff those molecules up these two little holes in the front of your face  you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose. If there's a real rose there  those molecules will be the ones  but even if there's no rose there  you'll have the memory of a molecule. How do we turn molecules into perceptions  What's the process by which that could happen  Here's another example  two very simple molecules  again in this kind of chemical notation. It might be easier to visualize them this way  so the gray circles are carbon atoms  the white ones are hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms. Now these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom and two little hydrogen atoms that ride along with it  and yet one of them  heptyl acetate  has the distinct odor of a pear  and hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana. So there are two really interesting questions here  it seems to me. One is  how can a simple little molecule like that create a perception in your brain that's so clear as a pear or a banana  And secondly  how the hell can we tell the difference between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom  I mean  that's remarkable to me  clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet. And you don't even think about it  do you  So this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us back to the ignorance and the idea of questions. I like to quote because I think dead people shouldn't be excluded from the conversation. And I also think it's important to realize that the conversation's been going on for a while  by the way. So Erwin Schrodinger  a great quantum physicist and  I think  philosopher  points out how you have to  abide by ignorance for an indefinite period  of time. And it's this abiding by ignorance that I think we have to learn how to do. This is a tricky thing. This is not such an easy business. I guess it comes down to our education system  so I'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education  because I think that's where it really has to play out. So for one  let's face it  in the age of Google and Wikipedia  the business model of the university and probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change. We just can't sell facts for a living anymore. They're available with a click of the mouse  or if you want to  you could probably just ask the wall one of these days  wherever they're going to hide the things that tell us all this stuff. So what do we have to do  We have to give our students a taste for the boundaries  for what's outside that circumference  for what's outside the facts  what's just beyond the facts. How do we do that  Well  one of the problems  of course  turns out to be testing. We currently have an educational system which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing. So in second grade  all the kids are interested in science  the girls and the boys. They like to take stuff apart. They have great curiosity. They like to investigate things. They go to science museums. They like to play around. They're in second grade. They're interested. But by   th or   th grade  fewer than    percent of them have any interest in science whatsoever  let alone a desire to go into science as a career. So we have this remarkably efficient system for beating any interest in science out of everybody's head. Is this what we want  I think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine calls  the bulimic method of education.  You know. You can imagine what it is. We just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here and then they puke it up on an exam over here and everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever. This can't possibly continue to go on. So what do we do  Well the geneticists  I have to say  have an interesting maxim they live by. Geneticists always say  you always get what you screen for. And that's meant as a warning. So we always will get what we screen for  and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods. Well  we hear a lot about testing and evaluation  and we have to think carefully when we're testing whether we're evaluating or whether we're weeding  whether we're weeding people out  whether we're making some cut. Evaluation is one thing. You hear a lot about evaluation in the literature these days  in the educational literature  but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts to an opportunity for trial and error. It amounts to a chance to work over a longer period of time with this kind of feedback. That's different than weeding  and usually  I have to tell you  when people talk about evaluation  evaluating students  evaluating teachers  evaluating schools  evaluating programs  that they're really talking about weeding. And that's a bad thing  because then you will get what you select for  which is what we've gotten so far. So I'd say what we need is a test that says   What is x   and the answers are  I don't know  because no one does   or  What's the question   Even better. Or   You know what  I'll look it up  I'll ask someone  I'll phone someone. I'll find out.  Because that's what we want people to do  and that's how you evaluate them. And maybe for the advanced placement classes  it could be   Here's the answer. What's the next question   That's the one I like in particular. So let me end with a quote from William Butler Yeats  who said  Education is not about filling buckets  it is lighting fires.  So I'd say  let's get out the matches. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  So I'm going to talk about trust  and I'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust. I think these are so commonplace  they've become clich s of our society. And I think there are three. One's a claim  there has been a great decline in trust  very widely believed. The second is an aim  we should have more trust. And the third is a task  we should rebuild trust. I think that the claim  the aim and the task are all misconceived. So what I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim  an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter. First the claim  Why do people think trust has declined  And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence  I don't know the answer. I'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others. I don't have an overview. But  of course  I can look at the opinion polls  and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined. When you actually look at opinion polls across time  there's not much evidence for that. That's to say  the people who were mistrusted    years ago  principally journalists and politicians  are still mistrusted. And the people who were highly trusted    years ago are still rather highly trusted  judges  nurses. The rest of us are in between  and by the way  the average person in the street is almost exactly midway. But is that good evidence  What opinion polls record is  of course  opinions. What else can they record  So they're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions. Do you trust politicians  Do you trust teachers  Now if somebody said to you   Do you trust greengrocers  Do you trust fishmongers  Do you trust elementary school teachers   you would probably begin by saying   To do what   And that would be a perfectly sensible response. And you might say  when you understood the answer to that   Well  I trust some of them  but not others.  That's a perfectly rational thing. In short  in our real lives  we seek to place trust in a differentiated way. We don't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office holder or type of person is going to be uniform. I might  for example  say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to teach the reception class to read  but in no way to drive the school minibus. I might  after all  know that she wasn't a good driver. I might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not    but perhaps not to keep a secret. Simple. So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated  why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly  I think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists  because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust. Secondly  what about the aim  The aim is to have more trust. Well frankly  I think that's a stupid aim. It's not what I would aim at. I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy. In fact  I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy. And I think  of those people who  for example  placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff  who then made off with them  and I think of them  and I think  well  yes  too much trust. More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life. Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim. Well once one says that  one says  yeah  okay  that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness. It's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects. And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things. Are they competent  Are they honest  Are they reliable  And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters  and reliable and honest  we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them  because they'll be trustworthy. But if  on the other hand  they're unreliable  we might not. I have friends who are competent and honest  but I would not trust them to post a letter  because they're forgetful. I have friends who are very confident they can do certain things  but I realize that they overestimate their own competence. And I'm very glad to say  I don't think I have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest. If so  I haven't yet spotted it. But that's what we're looking for  trustworthiness before trust. Trust is the response. Trustworthiness is what we have to judge. And  of course  it's difficult. Across the last few decades  we've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness. A lot of these systems have the converse effect. They don't work as they're supposed to. I remember I was talking with a midwife who said   Well  you see  the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby.  And all over our public life  our institutional life  we find that problem  that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite. It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks  like midwives  from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes  as we say. You can all give your own examples there. So so much for the aim. The aim  I think  is more trustworthiness  and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people  and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office holders or politicians are trustworthy. It's not easy. It is judgment  and simple reaction  attitudes  don't do adequately here. Now thirdly  the task. Calling the task rebuilding trust  I think  also gets things backwards. It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust. Well  we can do that for ourselves. We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness. We can do it two people together trying to improve trust. But trust  in the end  is distinctive because it's given by other people. You can't rebuild what other people give you. You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust. So you have to  I think  be trustworthy. And that  of course  is because you can't fool all of the people all of the time  usually. But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy. How to do it  Well every day  all over the place  it's being done by ordinary people  by officials  by institutions  quite effectively. Let me give you a simple commercial example. The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back  and they don't ask any questions. They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted. That's super. I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me. I think there's a big lesson in that. If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party  then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying. So in the end  I think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern. It is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy. So the moral of all this is  we need to think much less about trust  let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis detected by opinion polls  much more about being trustworthy  and how you give people adequate  useful and simple evidence that you're trustworthy. Thanks. We are going to take a quick voyage over the cognitive history of the   th century  because during that century  our minds have altered dramatically. As you all know  the cars that people drove in      have altered because the roads are better and because of technology. And our minds have altered  too. We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world  and it's a world where we've had to develop new mental habits  new habits of mind. And these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification  introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent  and also taking the hypothetical seriously  that is  wondering about what might have been rather than what is. Now  this dramatic change was drawn to my attention through massive I.Q. gains over time  and these have been truly massive. That is  we don't just get a few more questions right on I.Q. tests. We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented. Indeed  if you score the people a century ago against modern norms  they would have an average I.Q. of   . If you score us against their norms  we would have an average I.Q. of    . Now this has raised all sorts of questions. Were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation  Because    is normally the score for mental retardation. Or are we on the verge of all being gifted  Because     is the cutting line for giftedness. Now I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative that's much more illuminating than either of those  and to put this into perspective  let's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth and found a ruined civilization. And this Martian was an archaeologist  and they found scores  target scores  that people had used for shooting. And first they looked at       and they found that in a minute  people had only put one bullet in the bullseye. And then they found  in       that they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute. And then about      they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye. And initially  that archaeologist would be baffled. They would say  look  these tests were designed to find out how much people were steady of hand  how keen their eyesight was  whether they had control of their weapon. How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree  Well we now know  of course  the answer. If that Martian looked at battlefields  they would find that people had only muskets at the time of the Civil War and that they had repeating rifles at the time of the Spanish American War  and then they had machine guns by the time of World War I. And  in other words  it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible  not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of hand. Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery that we have picked up over those hundred years  and I think again that another thinker will help us here  and that's Luria. Luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age  and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world. They wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use. He found that they were resistant to deducing the hypothetical  to speculating about what might be  and he found finally that they didn't deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions. Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews. He talked to the head man of a person in rural Russia. They'd only had  as people had in       about four years of schooling. And he asked that particular person  what do crows and fish have in common  And the fellow said   Absolutely nothing. You know  I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow. A crow can peck at a fish. A fish can't do anything to a crow.  And Luria said   But aren't they both animals   And he said   Of course not. One's a fish. The other is a bird.  And he was interested  effectively  in what he could do with those concrete objects. And then Luria went to another person  and he said to them   There are no camels in Germany. Hamburg is a city in Germany. Are there camels in Hamburg   And the fellow said   Well  if it's large enough  there ought to be camels there.  And Luria said   But what do my words imply   And he said   Well  maybe it's a small village  and there's no room for camels.  In other words  he was unwilling to treat this as anything but a concrete problem  and he was used to camels being in villages  and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical  to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany. A third interview was conducted with someone about the North Pole. And Luria said   At the North Pole  there is always snow. Wherever there is always snow  the bears are white. What color are the bears at the North Pole   And the response was   Such a thing is to be settled by testimony. If a wise person came from the North Pole and told me the bears were white  I might believe him  but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear.  Now you see again  this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience  and it was important to that person what color bears were    that is  they had to hunt bears. They weren't willing to engage in this. One of them said to Luria   How can we solve things that aren't real problems  None of these problems are real. How can we address them   Now  these three categories    classification  using logic on abstractions  taking the hypothetical seriously    how much difference do they make in the real world beyond the testing room  And let me give you a few illustrations. First  almost all of us today get a high school diploma. That is  we've gone from four to eight years of education to    years of formal education  and    percent of Americans have actually experienced some type of tertiary education. Now  not only do we have much more education  and much of that education is scientific  and you can't do science without classifying the world. You can't do science without proposing hypotheses. You can't do science without making it logically consistent. And even down in grade school  things have changed. In       they looked at the examinations that the state of Ohio gave to    year olds  and they found that they were all for socially valued concrete information. They were things like  what are the capitals of the    or    states that existed at that time  When they looked at the exams that the state of Ohio gave in       they were all about abstractions. They were things like  why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital  And you were supposed to think  well  the state legislature was rural controlled  and they hated the big city  so rather than putting the capital in a big city  they put it in a county seat. They put it in Albany rather than New York. They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia. And so forth. So the tenor of education has changed. We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously  to use abstractions  and to link them logically. What about employment  Well  in       three percent of Americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding. Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers. Today     percent of Americans practice cognitively demanding professions  not only to the professions proper like lawyer or doctor or scientist or lecturer  but many  many sub professions having to do with being a technician  a computer programmer. A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands. And we can only meet the terms of employment in the modern world by being cognitively far more flexible. And it's not just that we have many more people in cognitively demanding professions. The professions have been upgraded. Compare the doctor in       who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve  with the modern general practitioner or specialist  with years of scientific training. Compare the banker in       who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage. Well  the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees may have been morally remiss  but they were cognitively very agile. They went far beyond that      banker. They had to look at computer projections for the housing market. They had to get complicated CDO squared in order to bundle debt together and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset. They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a AAA  though in many cases  they had virtually bribed the rating agencies. And they also  of course  had to get people to accept these so called assets and pay money for them even though they were highly vulnerable. Or take a farmer today. I take the farm manager of today as very different from the farmer of     . So it hasn't just been the spread of cognitively demanding professions. It's also been the upgrading of tasks like lawyer and doctor and what have you that have made demands on our cognitive faculties. But I've talked about education and employment. Some of the habits of mind that we have developed over the   th century have paid off in unexpected areas. I'm primarily a moral philosopher. I merely have a holiday in psychology  and what interests me in general is moral debate. Now over the last century  in developed nations like America  moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously  and we also take universals seriously and look for logical connections. When I came home in      from university at the time of Martin Luther King  a lot of people came home at that time and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents. My father was born in       and he was mildly racially biased. As an Irishman  he hated the English so much he didn't have much emotion for anyone else. But he did have a sense that black people were inferior. And when we said to our parents and grandparents   How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black   they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said. Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning    that turned black  In other words  they were fixed in the concrete mores and attitudes they had inherited. They would not take the hypothetical seriously  and without the hypothetical  it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground. You have to say  imagine you were in Iran  and imagine that your relatives all suffered from collateral damage even though they had done no wrong. How would you feel about that  And if someone of the older generation says  well  our government takes care of us  and it's up to their government to take care of them  they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously. Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped  and he feels he's honor bound to kill her. Well  he's treating his mores as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited  and they're unmovable in any way by logic. They're just inherited mores. Today we would say something like  well  imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized. Would you deserve to be killed  And he would say  well that's not in the Koran. That's not one of the principles I've got. Well you  today  universalize your principles. You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them. If you have a principle such as  people shouldn't suffer unless they're guilty of something  then to exclude black people you've got to make exceptions  don't you  You have to say  well  blackness of skin  you couldn't suffer just for that. It must be that blacks are somehow tainted. And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear  can't we  and say  well how can you consider all blacks tainted when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black. And you can get moral argument off the ground  then  because you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities. You're treating them as universals  to be rendered consistent by logic. Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests  That's what initially got me going on cognitive history. If you look at the I.Q. test  you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas. The similarities subtest of the Wechsler is about classification  and we have made enormous gains on that classification subtest. There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery that are about using logic on abstractions. Some of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices  and it's all about analogies. And in       people could do simple analogies. That is  if you said to them  cats are like wildcats. What are dogs like  They would say wolves. But by       people could attack Raven's on a much more sophisticated level. If you said  we've got two squares followed by a triangle  what follows two circles  They could say a semicircle. Just as a triangle is half of a square  a semicircle is half of a circle. By       college graduates  if you said two circles followed by a semicircle  two sixteens followed by what  they would say eight  because eight is half of   . That is  they had moved so far from the concrete world that they could even ignore the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question. Now  I should say one thing that's very disheartening. We haven't made progress on all fronts. One of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through politics  and sadly you can have humane moral principles  you can classify  you can use logic on abstractions  and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries  you can't do politics. We've noticed  in a trend among young Americans  that they read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands  and they're essentially ahistorical. They live in the bubble of the present. They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam. They don't know who was an ally of America in World War II. Think how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fifth time Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order  and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions. And that is  they had barely left  and there wasn't a trace in the sand. Or imagine how different things would be if most Americans knew that we had been lied into four of our last six wars. You know  the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine  the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions  the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet  and  of course  Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda and had nothing to do with it  and yet the administration convinced    percent of the people that they were brothers in arms  when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost. But I don't want to end on a pessimistic note. The   th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves in ordinary people that we have now realized  and the aristocracy was convinced that the average person couldn't make it  that they could never share their mindset or their cognitive abilities. Lord Curzon once said he saw people bathing in the North Sea  and he said   Why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have   As if they were a reptile. Well  Dickens was right and he was wrong.  Correction  Rudyard Kipling   Kipling  said   The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters underneath the skin.  For a long time in my life  I felt like I'd been living two different lives. There's the life that everyone sees  and then there's the life that only I see. And in the life that everyone sees  who I am is a friend  a son  a brother  a stand up comedian and a teenager. That's the life everyone sees. If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me  that's what they would tell you. And that's a huge part of me. That is who I am. And if you were to ask me to describe myself  I'd probably say some of those same things. And I wouldn't be lying  but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth  either  because the truth is  that's just the life everyone else sees. In the life that only I see  who I am  who I really am  is someone who struggles intensely with depression. I have for the last six years of my life  and I continue to every day. Now  for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn't really know what that means  that might surprise them to hear  because there's this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong  when you break up with your girlfriend  when you lose a loved one  when you don't get the job you wanted. But that's sadness. That's a natural thing. That's a natural human emotion. Real depression isn't being sad when something in your life goes wrong. Real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right. That's real depression  and that's what I suffer from. And to be totally honest  that's hard for me to stand up here and say. It's hard for me to talk about  and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about  so much so that no one's talking about it. And no one's talking about depression  but we need to be  because right now it's a massive problem. It's a massive problem. But we don't see it on social media  right  We don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter. We don't see it on the news  because it's not happy  it's not fun  it's not light. And so because we don't see it  we don't see the severity of it. But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this  every    seconds  every    seconds  somewhere  someone in the world takes their own life because of depression  and it might be two blocks away  it might be two countries away  it might be two continents away  but it's happening  and it's happening every single day. And we have a tendency  as a society  to look at that and go   So what   So what  We look at that  and we go   That's your problem. That's their problem.  We say we're sad and we say we're sorry  but we also say   So what   Well  two years ago it was my problem  because I sat on the edge of my bed where I'd sat a million times before and I was suicidal. I was suicidal  and if you were to look at my life on the surface  you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal. You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team  the drama and theater student of the year  the English student of the year  someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party. So you would say I wasn't depressed  you would say I wasn't suicidal  but you would be wrong. You would be wrong. So I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and I thought about taking my own life and I came this close to doing it. I came this close to doing it. And I didn't  so that makes me one of the lucky ones  one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump  one of the lucky ones who survives. Well  I survived  and that just leaves me with my story  and my story is this  In four simple words  I suffer from depression. I suffer from depression  and for a long time  I think  I was living two totally different lives  where one person was always afraid of the other. I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was  that I wasn't the perfect  popular kid in high school everyone thought I was  that beneath my smile  there was struggle  and beneath my light  there was dark  and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain. See  some people might fear girls not liking them back. Some people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death. But for me  for a large part of my life  I feared myself. I feared my truth  I feared my honesty  I feared my vulnerability  and that fear made me feel like I was forced into a corner  like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out  and so I thought about that way every single day. I thought about it every single day  and if I'm being totally honest  standing here I've thought about it again since  because that's the sickness  that's the struggle  that's depression  and depression isn't chicken pox. You don't beat it once and it's gone forever. It's something you live with. It's something you live in. It's the roommate you can't kick out. It's the voice you can't ignore. It's the feelings you can't seem to escape  the scariest part is that after a while  you become numb to it. It becomes normal for you  and what you really fear the most isn't the suffering inside of you. It's the stigma inside of others  it's the shame  it's the embarrassment  it's the disapproving look on a friend's face  it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak  it's the comments that you're crazy. That's what keeps you from getting help. That's what makes you hold it in and hide it. It's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it  and you hold it in and you hide it  and even though it's keeping you in bed every day and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it  you hide it  because the stigma in our society around depression is very real. It's very real  and if you think that it isn't  ask yourself this  Would you rather make your next Facebook status say you're having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you're depressed  That's the stigma  because unfortunately  we live in a world where if you break your arm  everyone runs over to sign your cast  but if you tell people you're depressed  everyone runs the other way. That's the stigma. We are so  so  so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains. And that's ignorance. That's pure ignorance  and that ignorance has created a world that doesn't understand depression  that doesn't understand mental health. And that's ironic to me  because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world  yet it's one of the least discussed. We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself. Well  it won't. It hasn't  and it's not going to  because that's wishful thinking  and wishful thinking isn't a game plan  it's procrastination  and we can't procrastinate on something this important. The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. Well  we haven't done that  so we can't really expect to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question. And I don't know what the solution is. I wish I did  but I don't    but I think  I think it has to start here. It has to start with me  it has to start with you  it has to start with the people who are suffering  the ones who are hidden in the shadows. We need to speak up and shatter the silence. We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in  because if there's one thing that I've come to realize  if there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem  it's not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others. It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves  where we're okay with who we are  because when we get honest  we see that we all struggle and we all suffer. Whether it's with this  whether it's with something else  we all know what it is to hurt. We all know what it is to have pain in our heart  and we all know how important it is to heal. But right now  depression is society's deep cut that we're content to put a Band Aid over and pretend it's not there. Well  it is there. It is there  and you know what  It's okay. Depression is okay. If you're going through it  know that you're okay. And know that you're sick  you're not weak  and it's an issue  not an identity  because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others  you can see depression for what it really is  and that's just a part of life  just a part of life  and as much as I hate  as much as I hate some of the places  some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to  in a lot of ways I'm grateful for it. Because yeah  it's put me in the valleys  but only to show me there's peaks  and yeah it's dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light. My pain  more than anything in    years on this planet  has given me perspective  and my hurt  my hurt has forced me to have hope  have hope and to have faith  faith in myself  faith in others  faith that it can get better  that we can change this  that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance  fight back against intolerance  and more than anything  learn to love ourselves  learn to accept ourselves for who we are  the people we are  not the people the world wants us to be. Because the world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark. The world I believe in is one where we're measured by our ability to overcome adversities  not avoid them. The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say   I'm going through hell   and they can look back at me and go   Me too   and that's okay  and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people. We're people  and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry  and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness  then I'm here to tell you you're wrong. You're wrong  because it's the opposite. We're people  and we have problems. We're not perfect  and that's okay. So we need to stop the ignorance  stop the intolerance  stop the stigma  and stop the silence  and we need to take away the taboos  take a look at the truth  and start talking  because the only way we're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together  by standing strong together. And I believe that we can. I believe that we can. Thank you guys so much. This is a dream come true. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  So I wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book  and it's a story of something that happened       years ago  when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy. And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel. And the reason the story obsessed me is that I thought I understood it  and then I went back over it and I realized that I didn't understand it at all. Ancient Palestine had a    along its eastern border  there's a mountain range. Still same is true of Israel today. And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region  so Jerusalem  Bethlehem  Hebron. And then there's a coastal plain along the Mediterranean  where Tel Aviv is now. And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the Shephelah  which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west  and you can follow the Shephelah  go through the Shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains. And the Shephelah  if you've been to Israel  you'll know it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel. It's gorgeous  with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards. But more importantly  though  in the history of that region  it's served  it's had a real strategic function  and that is  it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way  get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains. And       years ago  that's exactly what happens. The Philistines  who are the biggest of enemies of the Kingdom of Israel  are living in the coastal plain. They're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people. And they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the Shephelah up into the mountains  because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two. And the Kingdom of Israel  which is headed by King Saul  obviously catches wind of this  and Saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah  one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah. And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge  and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge  and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other  because they're deadlocked. Neither can attack the other  because to attack the other side you've got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side  and you're completely exposed. So finally  to break the deadlock  the Philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor  and he calls out and he says to the Israelites   Send your mightiest warrior down  and we'll have this out  just the two of us.  This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat. It was a way of settling disputes without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle. And the Philistine who is sent down  their mighty warrior  is a giant. He's   foot  . He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor  and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin and he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying. And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him. It's a death wish  right  There's no way they think they can take him. And finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy  and he goes up to Saul and he says   I'll fight him.  And Saul says   You can't fight him. That's ridiculous. You're this kid. This is this mighty warrior.  But the shepherd is adamant. He says   No  no  no  you don't understand  I have been defending my flock against lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it.  And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward. So he says   All right.  And then he turns to the kid  and he says   But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are.  So he tries to give the shepherd his armor  and the shepherd says   No.  He says   I can't wear this stuff.  The Biblical verse is   I cannot wear this for I have not proved it   meaning   I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy.  So he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd's bag and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant. And the giant sees this figure approaching  and calls out   Come to me so I can feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field.  He issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him. And the shepherd draws closer and closer  and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff. That's all he's carrying. Instead of a weapon  just this shepherd's staff  and he says    he's insulted     Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks   And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket  puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes    right here  in his most vulnerable spot    and he falls down either dead or unconscious  and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head  and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run. And of course  the name of the giant is Goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is David  and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything I thought I knew about that story turned out to be wrong. So David  in that story  is supposed to be the underdog  right  In fact  that term  David and Goliath  has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger. Now why do we call David an underdog  Well  we call him an underdog because he's a kid  a little kid  and Goliath is this big  strong giant. We also call him an underdog because Goliath is an experienced warrior  and David is just a shepherd. But most importantly  we call him an underdog because all he has is    it's that Goliath is outfitted with all of this modern weaponry  this glittering coat of armor and a sword and a javelin and a spear  and all David has is this sling. Well  let's start there with the phrase  All David has is this sling   because that's the first mistake that we make. In ancient warfare  there are three kinds of warriors. There's cavalry  men on horseback and with chariots. There's heavy infantry  which are foot soldiers  armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor. And there's artillery  and artillery are archers  but  more importantly  slingers. And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it  and they put a projectile  either a rock or a lead ball  inside the pouch  and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go  and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target. That's what David has  and it's important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot. It's not this  right  It's not a child's toy. It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon. When David rolls it around like this  he's turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second  and that means that when the rock is released  it's going forward really fast  probably    meters per second. That's substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers. More than that  the stones in the Valley of Elah were not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate  which are rocks twice the density of normal stones. If you do the calculations on the ballistics  on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling  it's roughly equal to the stopping power of a  .   caliber  handgun. This is an incredibly devastating weapon. Accuracy  we know from historical records that slingers    experienced slingers could hit and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to     yards. From medieval tapestries  we know that slingers were capable of hitting birds in flight. They were incredibly accurate. When David lines up    and he's not     yards away from Goliath  he's quite close to Goliath    when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath  he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes. If you go back over the history of ancient warfare  you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another. So what's Goliath  He's heavy infantry  and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman. When he says   Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field   the key phrase is  Come to me.  Come up to me because we're going to fight  hand to hand  like this. Saul has the same expectation. David says   I want to fight Goliath   and Saul tries to give him his armor  because Saul is thinking   Oh  when you say 'fight Goliath ' you mean 'fight him in hand to hand combat ' infantry on infantry.  But David has absolutely no expectation. He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he  He's a shepherd. He's spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves. That's where his strength lies. So here he is  this shepherd  experienced in the use of a devastating weapon  up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short range combat. Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance. So why do we keep calling David an underdog  and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable  There's a second piece of this that's important. It's not just that we misunderstand David and his choice of weaponry. It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath. Goliath is not what he seems to be. There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text  things that are in retrospect quite puzzling and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior. So to begin with  the Bible says that Goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant. Now that is weird  right  Here is this mighty warrior challenging the Israelites to one on one combat. Why is he being led by the hand by some young boy  presumably  to the point of combat  Secondly  the Bible story makes special note of how slowly Goliath moves  another odd thing to say when you're describing the mightiest warrior known to man at that point. And then there's this whole weird thing about how long it takes Goliath to react to the sight of David. So David's coming down the mountain  and he's clearly not preparing for hand to hand combat. There is nothing about him that says   I am about to fight you like this.  He's not even carrying a sword. Why does Goliath not react to that  It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day. And then there's that strange comment he makes to David   Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks   Sticks  David only has one stick. Well  it turns out that there's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with Goliath  an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies. There have been many articles written. The first one was in      in the Indiana Medical Journal  and it started a chain of speculation that starts with an explanation for Goliath's height. So Goliath is head and shoulders above all of his peers in that era  and usually when someone is that far out of the norm  there's an explanation for it. So the most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly  and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone. And throughout history  many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly. So the tallest person of all time was a guy named Robert Wadlow who was still growing when he died at the age of    and he was   foot   . He had acromegaly. Do you remember the wrestler Andr  the Giant  Famous. He had acromegaly. There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly. Anyone who's unusually tall  that's the first explanation we come up with. And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it  principally having to do with vision. The pituitary tumor  as it grows  often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain  with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted. So when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with Goliath  they've said   Wait a minute  he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly.  And that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day. Why does he move so slowly and have to be escorted down into the valley floor by an attendant  Because he can't make his way on his own. Why is he so strangely oblivious to David that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him until the very last moment  Because he can't see him. When he says   Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field   the phrase  come to me  is a hint also of his vulnerability. Come to me because I can't see you. And then there's   Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks   He sees two sticks when David has only one. So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe. What they didn't understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness. And there is  I think  in that  a very important lesson for all of us. Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem. And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket. Thank you.
