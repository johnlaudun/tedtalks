Why does the universe exist  Why is there   Okay. Okay.  Laughter  This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn. Why is there a world  why are we in it  and why is there something rather than nothing at all  I mean  this is the super ultimate  why  question  So I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence  the puzzle of existence  where we are now in addressing it  and why you should care  and I hope you do care. The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that those who don't wonder about the contingency of their existence  of the contingency of the world's existence  are mentally deficient. That's a little harsh  but still.  Laughter  So this has been called the most sublime and awesome mystery  the deepest and most far reaching question man can pose. It's obsessed great thinkers. Ludwig Wittgenstein  perhaps the greatest philosopher of the   th century  was astonished that there should be a world at all. He wrote in his  Tractatus   Proposition  .     It is not how things are in the world that is the mystical  it's that the world exists.  And if you don't like taking your epigrams from a philosopher  try a scientist. John Archibald Wheeler  one of the great physicists of the   th century  the teacher of Richard Feynman  the coiner of the term  black hole   he said   I want to know how come the quantum  how come the universe  how come existence   And my friend Martin Amis   sorry that I'll be doing a lot of name dropping in this talk  so get used to it   my dear friend Martin Amis once said that we're about five Einsteins away from answering the mystery of where the universe came from. And I've no doubt there are five Einsteins in the audience tonight. Any Einsteins  Show of hands  No  No  No  No Einsteins  Okay. So this question  why is there something rather than nothing  this sublime question  was posed rather late in intellectual history. It was towards the end of the   th century  the philosopher Leibniz who asked it  a very smart guy  Leibniz  who invented the calculus independently of Isaac Newton  at about the same time  but for Leibniz  who asked why is there something rather than nothing  this was not a great mystery. He either was or pretended to be an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook  and he said it's obvious why the world exists  because God created it. And God created  indeed  out of nothing at all. That's how powerful God is. He doesn't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of. He can make it out of sheer nothingness  creation ex nihilo. And by the way  this is what most Americans today believe. There is no mystery of existence for them. God made it. So let's put this in an equation. I don't have any slides so I'm going to mime my visuals  so use your imaginations. So it's God   nothing   the world. Okay  Now that's the equation. And so maybe you don't believe in God. Maybe you're a scientific atheist or an unscientific atheist  and you don't believe in God  and you're not happy with it. By the way  even if we have this equation  God   nothing   the world  there's already a problem  Why does God exist  God doesn't exist by logic alone unless you believe the ontological argument  and I hope you don't  because it's not a good argument. So it's conceivable  if God were to exist  he might wonder  I'm eternal  I'm all powerful  but where did I come from  Whence then am I  God speaks in a more formal English. And so one theory is that God was so bored with pondering the puzzle of His own existence that He created the world just to distract himself. But anyway  let's forget about God. Take God out of the equation  We have            nothing   the world. Now  if you're a Buddhist  you might want to stop right there  because essentially what you've got is nothing   the world  and by symmetry of identity  that means the world   nothing. Okay  And to a Buddhist  the world is just a whole lot of nothing. It's just a big cosmic vacuity. And we think there's a lot of something out there but that's because we're enslaved by our desires. If we let our desires melt away  we'll see the world for what it truly is  a vacuity  nothingness  and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana which has been defined as having just enough life to enjoy being dead.  Laughter  So that's the Buddhist thinking. But I'm a Westerner  and I'm still concerned with the puzzle of existence  so I've got              this is going to get serious in a minute  so              nothing   the world. What are we going to put in that blank  Well  how about science  Science is our best guide to the nature of reality  and the most fundamental science is physics. That tells us what naked reality really is  that reveals what I call TAUFOTU  the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe. So maybe physics can fill this blank  and indeed  since about the late     s or around       physicists have purported to give a purely scientific explanation of how a universe like ours could have popped into existence out of sheer nothingness  a quantum fluctuation out of the void. Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists  more recently Alex Vilenkin  and the whole thing has been popularized by another very fine physicist and friend of mine  Lawrence Krauss  who wrote a book called  A Universe from Nothing   and Lawrence thinks that he's given   he's a militant atheist  by the way  so he's gotten God out of the picture. The laws of quantum field theory  the state of the art physics  can show how out of sheer nothingness  no space  no time  no matter  nothing  a little nugget of false vacuum can fluctuate into existence  and then  by the miracle of inflation  blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos we see around us. Okay  this is a really ingenious scenario. It's very speculative. It's fascinating. But I've got a big problem with it  and the problem is this  It's a pseudo religious point of view. Now  Lawrence thinks he's an atheist  but he's still in thrall to a religious worldview. He sees physical laws as being like divine commands. The laws of quantum field theory for him are like fiat lux   Let there be light.  The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout that they can form the abyss  that it's pregnant with being. They can call a world into existence out of nothing. But that's a very primitive view of what a physical law is  right  We know that physical laws are actually generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities in the world. They don't exist outside the world. They don't have any ontic cloud of their own. They can't call a world into existence out of nothingness. That's a very primitive view of what a scientific law is. And if you don't believe me on this  listen to Stephen Hawking  who himself put forward a model of the cosmos that was self contained  didn't require any outside cause  any creator  and after proposing this  Hawking admitted that he was still puzzled. He said  this model is just equations. What breathes fire into the equations and creates a world for them to describe  He was puzzled by this  so equations themselves can't do the magic  can't resolve the puzzle of existence. And besides  even if the laws could do that  why this set of laws  Why quantum field theory that describes a universe with a certain number of forces and particles and so forth  Why not a completely different set of laws  There are many  many mathematically consistent sets of laws. Why not no laws at all  Why not sheer nothingness  So this is a problem  believe it or not  that reflective physicists really think a lot about  and at this point they tend to go metaphysical  say  well  maybe the set of laws that describes our universe  it's just one set of laws and it describes one part of reality  but maybe every consistent set of laws describes another part of reality  and in fact all possible physical worlds really exist  they're all out there. We just see a little tiny part of reality that's described by the laws of quantum field theory  but there are many  many other worlds  parts of reality that are described by vastly different theories that are different from ours in ways we can't imagine  that are inconceivably exotic. Steven Weinberg  the father of the standard model of particle physics  has actually flirted with this idea himself  that all possible realities actually exist. Also  a younger physicist  Max Tegmark  who believes that all mathematical structures exist  and mathematical existence is the same thing as physical existence  so we have this vastly rich multiverse that encompasses every logical possibility. Now  in taking this metaphysical way out  these physicists and also philosophers are actually reaching back to a very old idea that goes back to Plato. It's the principle of plenitude or fecundity  or the great chain of being  that reality is actually as full as possible. It's as far removed from nothingness as it could possibly be. So we have these two extremes now. We have sheer nothingness on one side  and we have this vision of a reality that encompasses every conceivable world at the other extreme  the fullest possible reality  nothingness  the simplest possible reality. Now what's in between these two extremes  There are all kinds of intermediate realities that include some things and leave out others. So one of these intermediate realities is  say  the most mathematically elegant reality  that leaves out the inelegant bits  the ugly asymmetries and so forth. Now  there are some physicists who will tell you that we're actually living in the most elegant reality. I think that Brian Greene is in the audience  and he has written a book called  The Elegant Universe.  He claims that the universe we live in mathematically is very elegant. Don't believe him.  Laughter  It's a pious hope  I wish it were true  but I think the other day he admitted to me it's really an ugly universe. It's stupidly constructed  it's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles  and what the hell is dark energy  It's a stick and bubble gum contraption. It's not an elegant universe.  Laughter  And then there's the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense. You should get solemn now  because a world in which sentient beings don't suffer needlessly  in which there aren't things like childhood cancer or the Holocaust. This is an ethical conception. Anyway  so between nothingness and the fullest possible reality  various special realities. Nothingness is special. It's the simplest. Then there's the most elegant possible reality. That's special. The fullest possible reality  that's special. But what are we leaving out here  There's also just the crummy  generic realities that aren't special in any way  that are sort of random. They're infinitely removed from nothingness  but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness. They're a mixture of chaos and order  of mathematical elegance and ugliness. So I would describe these realities as an infinite  mediocre  incomplete mess  a generic reality  a kind of cosmic junk shot. And these realities  is there a deity in any of these realities  Maybe  but the deity isn't perfect like the Judeo Christian deity. The deity isn't all good and all powerful. It might be instead     percent malevolent but only    percent effective  which pretty much describes the world we see around us  I think.  Laughter  So I would like to propose that the resolution to the mystery of existence is that the reality we exist in is one of these generic realities. Reality has to turn out some way. It can either turn out to be nothing or everything or something in between. So if it has some special feature  like being really elegant or really full or really simple  like nothingness  that would require an explanation. But if it's just one of these random  generic realities  there's no further explanation for it. And indeed  I would say that's the reality we live in. That's what science is telling us. At the beginning of the week  we got the exciting information that the theory of inflation  which predicts a big  infinite  messy  arbitrary  pointless reality  it's like a big frothing champagne coming out of a bottle endlessly  a vast universe  mostly a wasteland with little pockets of charm and order and peace  this has been confirmed  this inflationary scenario  by the observations made by radio telescopes in Antarctica that looked at the signature of the gravitational waves from just before the Big Bang. I'm sure you all know about this. So anyway  I think there's some evidence that this really is the reality that we're stuck with. Now  why should you care  Well    Laughter    the question   Why does the world exist   that's the cosmic question  it sort of rhymes with a more intimate question  Why do I exist  Why do you exist  you know  our existence would seem to be amazingly improbable  because there's an enormous number of genetically possible humans  if you can compute it by looking at the number of the genes and the number of alleles and so forth  and a back of the envelope calculation will tell you there are about    to the       th possible humans  genetically. That's between a googol and a googolplex. And the number of the actual humans that have existed is     billion  maybe    billion  an infinitesimal fraction  so all of us  we've won this amazing cosmic lottery. We're here. Okay. So what kind of reality do we want to live in  Do we want to live in a special reality  What if we were living in the most elegant possible reality  Imagine the existential pressure on us to live up to that  to be elegant  not to pull down the tone of it. Or  what if we were living in the fullest possible reality  Well then our existence would be guaranteed  because every possible thing exists in that reality  but our choices would be meaningless. If I really struggle morally and agonize and I decide to do the right thing  what difference does it make  because there are an infinite number of versions of me also doing the right thing and an infinite number doing the wrong thing. So my choices are meaningless. So we don't want to live in that special reality. And as for the special reality of nothingness  we wouldn't be having this conversation. So I think living in a generic reality that's mediocre  there are nasty bits and nice bits and we could make the nice bits bigger and the nasty bits smaller and that gives us a kind of purpose in life. The universe is absurd  but we can still construct a purpose  and that's a pretty good one  and the overall mediocrity of reality kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity we all feel in the core of our being. And I know you feel it. I know you're all special  but you're still kind of secretly mediocre  don't you think  So anyway  you may say  this  puzzle  the mystery of existence  it's just silly mystery mongering. You're not astonished at the existence of the universe and you're in good company. Bertrand Russell said   I should say the universe is just there  and that's all.  Just a brute fact. And my professor at Columbia  Sidney Morgenbesser  a great philosophical wag  when I said to him   Professor Morgenbesser  why is there something rather than nothing   And he said   Oh  even if there was nothing  you still wouldn't be satisfied.  So    Laughter    okay. So you're not astonished. I don't care. But I will tell you something to conclude that I guarantee you will astonish you  because it's astonished all of the brilliant  wonderful people I've met at this TED conference  when I've told them  and it's this  Never in my life have I had a cell phone. Thank you. Hi  kids. I'm   . My husband is   . My parents are in their late   s  and Olivia  the dog  is   . So let's talk about aging. Let me tell you how I feel when I see my wrinkles in the mirror and I realize that some parts of me have dropped and I can't find them down there. Mary Oliver says in one of her poems   Tell me  what is it that you plan to do with your one wild and precious life   Me  I intend to live passionately. When do we start aging  Society decides when we are old  usually around     when we get Medicare  but we really start aging at birth. We are aging right now  and we all experience it differently. We all feel younger than our real age  because the spirit never ages. I am still   . Sophia Loren. Look at her. She says that everything you see she owes to spaghetti. I tried it and gained    pounds in the wrong places. But attitude  aging is also attitude and health. But my real mentor in this journey of aging is Olga Murray. This California girl at    started working in Nepal to save young girls from domestic bondage. At     she has saved        girls  and she has changed the culture in the country. Now it is illegal for fathers to sell their daughters into servitude. She has also founded orphanages and nutritional clinics. She is always happy and eternally young. What have I lost in the last decades  People  of course  places  and the boundless energy of my youth  and I'm beginning to lose independence  and that scares me. Ram Dass says that dependency hurts  but if you accept it  there is less suffering. After a very bad stroke  his ageless soul watches the changes in the body with tenderness  and he is grateful to the people who help him. What have I gained  Freedom  I don't have to prove anything anymore. I'm not stuck in the idea of who I was  who I want to be  or what other people expect me to be. I don't have to please men anymore  only animals. I keep telling my superego to back off and let me enjoy what I still have. My body may be falling apart  but my brain is not  yet. I love my brain. I feel lighter. I don't carry grudges  ambition  vanity  none of the deadly sins that are not even worth the trouble. It's great to let go. I should have started sooner. And I also feel softer because I'm not scared of being vulnerable. I don't see it as weakness anymore. And I've gained spirituality. I'm aware that before  death was in the neighborhood. Now  it's next door  or in my house. I try to live mindfully and be present in the moment. By the way  the Dalai Lama is someone who has aged beautifully  but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate  Meditation helps. Isabel Allende  Ommm. Ommm. There it is. And it's good to start early. You know  for a vain female like myself  it's very hard to age in this culture. Inside  I feel good  I feel charming  seductive  sexy. Nobody else sees that.  Laughter  I'm invisible. I want to be the center of attention. I hate to be invisible. This is Grace Dammann. She has been in a wheelchair for six years after a terrible car accident. She says that there is nothing more sensual than a hot shower  that every drop of water is a blessing to the senses. She doesn't see herself as disabled. In her mind  she's still surfing in the ocean. Ethel Seiderman  a feisty  beloved activist in the place where I live in California. She wears red patent shoes  and her mantra is that one scarf is nice but two is better. She has been a widow for nine years  but she's not looking for another mate. She says that there is only a limited number of ways you can screw   well  she says it in another way   and she has tried them all. I  on the other hand  I still have erotic fantasies with Antonio Banderas   and my poor husband has to put up with it. So how can I stay passionate  I cannot will myself to be passionate at   . I have been training for some time  and when I feel flat and bored  I fake it. Attitude  attitude. How do I train  I train by saying yes to whatever comes my way  drama  comedy  tragedy  love  death  losses. Yes to life. And I train by trying to stay in love. It doesn't always work  but you cannot blame me for trying. And  on a final note  retirement in Spanish is jubilaci n. Jubilation. Celebration. We have paid our dues. We have contributed to society. Now it's our time  and it's a great time. Unless you are ill or very poor  you have choices. I have chosen to stay passionate  engaged with an open heart. I am working on it every day. Want to join me  Thank you. June Cohen  So Isabel   IA  Thank you. JC  First of all  I never like to presume to speak for the TED community  but I would like to tell you that I have a feeling we can all agree that you are still charming  seductive and sexy. Yes  IA  Aww  thank you.  Applause  JC  Hands down. IA  No  it's makeup. Moderator  Now  would it be awkward if I asked you a follow up question about your erotic fantasies  IA  Oh  of course. About what  Moderator  About your erotic fantasies. IA  With Antonio Banderas. Moderator  I was just wondering if you have anything more to share. IA  Well  one of them is that    Laughter  One of them is that I place a naked Antonio Banderas on a Mexican tortilla  I slather him with guacamole and salsa  I roll him up  and I eat him.  Laughter  Thank you. I'm an industrial engineer. The goal in my life has always been to make more and more products in the least amount of time and resources. While working at Toyota  all I knew was how to make cars until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki  who came to our factory to make a forest in it in order to make it carbon neutral. I was so fascinated that I decided to learn this methodology by joining his team as a volunteer. Soon  I started making a forest in the backyard of my own house  and this is how it looks after three years. These forests  compared to a conventional plantation  grow    times faster  they're    times more dense  and     times more biodiverse. Within two years of having this forest in our backyard  I could observe that the groundwater didn't dry during summers  the number of bird species I spotted in this area doubled. Quality of air became better  and we started harvesting seasonal fruits growing effortlessly right in the backyard of our house. I wanted to make more of these forests. I was so moved by these results that I wanted to make these forests with the same acumen with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business  so I founded a company which is an end to end service provider to create these native natural forests. But to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry  we had to standardize the process of forest making. So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System known for its quality and efficiency for the process of forest making. For an example  the core of TPS  Toyota Production System  lies in heijunka  which is making manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly line. We replaced these cars with trees  using which now we can make multi layered forests. These forests utilize     percent vertical space. They are so dense that one can't even walk into them. For an example  we can make a     tree forest in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars. In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint  we started utilizing local biomass as soil amender and fertilizers. For example  coconut shells crushed in a machine mixed with rice straw  powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure is finally dumped in soil on which our forest is planted. Once planted  we use grass or rice straw to cover the soil so that all the water which goes into irrigation doesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere. And using these simple improvisations  today we can make a forest for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone. Today  we are making forests in houses  in schools  even in factories with the corporates. But that's not enough. There is a huge number of people who want to take matters into their own hands. So we let it happen. Today  we are working on an Internet based platform where we are going to share our methodology on an open source using which anyone and everyone can make their own forest without our physical presence being there  using our methodology. At the click of a button  they can get to know all the native species of their place. By installing a small hardware probe on site  we can do remote soil testing  using which we can give step by step instructions on forest making remotely. Also we can monitor the growth of this forest without being on site. This methodology  I believe  has a potential. By sharing  we can actually bring back our native forests. Now  when you go back home  if you see a barren piece of land  do remember that it can be a potential forest. Thank you very much. Thanks. This is a photograph of a man whom for many years I plotted to kill. This is my father  Clinton George  Bageye  Grant. He's called Bageye because he has permanent bags under his eyes. As a    year old  along with my siblings  I dreamt of scraping off the poison from fly killer paper into his coffee  grounded down glass and sprinkling it over his breakfast  loosening the carpet on the stairs so he would trip and break his neck. But come the day  he would always skip that loose step  he would always bow out of the house without so much as a swig of coffee or a bite to eat. And so for many years  I feared that my father would die before I had a chance to kill him. Up until our mother asked him to leave and not come back  Bageye had been a terrifying ogre. He teetered permanently on the verge of rage  rather like me  as you see. He worked nights at Vauxhall Motors in Luton and demanded total silence throughout the house  so that when we came home from school at      in the afternoon  we would huddle beside the TV  and rather like safe crackers  we would twiddle with the volume control knob on the TV so it was almost inaudible. And at times  when we were like this  so much  Shhh   so much  Shhh  going on in the house that I imagined us to be like the German crew of a U boat creeping along the edge of the ocean whilst up above  on the surface  HMS Bageye patrolled ready to drop death charges at the first sound of any disturbance. So that lesson was the lesson that  Do not draw attention to yourself either in the home or outside of the home.  Maybe it's a migrant lesson. We were to be below the radar  so there was no communication  really  between Bageye and us and us and Bageye  and the sound that we most looked forward to  you know when you're a child and you want your father to come home and it's all going to be happy and you're waiting for that sound of the door opening. Well the sound that we looked forward to was the click of the door closing  which meant he'd gone and would not come back. So for three decades  I never laid eyes on my father  nor he on me. We never spoke to each other for three decades  and then a couple of years ago  I decided to turn the spotlight on him.  You are being watched. Actually  you are. You are being watched.  That was his mantra to us  his children. Time and time again he would say this to us. And this was the     s  it was Luton  where he worked at Vauxhall Motors  and he was a Jamaican. And what he meant was  you as a child of a Jamaican immigrant are being watched to see which way you turn  to see whether you conform to the host nation's stereotype of you  of being feckless  work shy  destined for a life of crime. You are being watched  so confound their expectations of you. To that end  Bageye and his friends  mostly Jamaican  exhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura  Turn your best side to the world  show your best face to the world. If you have seen some of the images of the Caribbean people arriving in the '  s and '  s  you might have noticed that a lot of the men wear trilbies. Now  there was no tradition of wearing trilbies in Jamaica. They invented that tradition for their arrival here. They wanted to project themselves in a way that they wanted to be perceived  so that the way they looked and the names that they gave themselves defined them. So Bageye is bald and has baggy eyes. Tidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear. Anxious is always anxious. Clock has one arm longer than the other. And my all time favorite was the guy they called Summerwear. When Summerwear came to this country from Jamaica in the early '  s  he insisted on wearing light summer suits  no matter the weather  and in the course of researching their lives  I asked my mom   Whatever became of Summerwear   And she said   He caught a cold and died.   Laughter  But men like Summerwear taught us the importance of style. Maybe they exaggerated their style because they thought that they were not considered to be quite civilized  and they transferred that generational attitude or anxiety onto us  the next generation  so much so that when I was growing up  if ever on the television news or radio a report came up about a black person committing some crime   a mugging  a murder  a burglary   we winced along with our parents  because they were letting the side down. You did not just represent yourself. You represented the group  and it was a terrifying thing to come to terms with  in a way  that maybe you were going to be perceived in the same light. So that was what needed to be challenged. Our father and many of his colleagues exhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving. They were built to transmit but not receive. We were to keep quiet. When our father did speak to us  it was from the pulpit of his mind. They clung to certainty in the belief that doubt would undermine them. But when I am working in my house and writing  after a day's writing  I rush downstairs and I'm very excited to talk about Marcus Garvey or Bob Marley and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies and I'm so excited that my children stop me  and they say   Dad  nobody cares.  But they do care  actually. They cross over. Somehow they find their way to you. They shape their lives according to the narrative of your life  as I did with my father and my mother  perhaps  and maybe Bageye did with his father. And that was clearer to me in the course of looking at his life and understanding  as they say  the Native Americans say   Do not criticize the man until you can walk in his moccasins.  But in conjuring his life  it was okay and very straightforward to portray a Caribbean life in England in the     s with bowls of plastic fruit  polystyrene ceiling tiles  settees permanently sheathed in their transparent covers that they were delivered in. But what's more difficult to navigate is the emotional landscape between the generations  and the old adage that with age comes wisdom is not true. With age comes the veneer of respectability and a veneer of uncomfortable truths. But what was true was that my parents  my mother  and my father went along with it  did not trust the state to educate me. So listen to how I sound. They determined that they would send me to a private school  but my father worked at Vauxhall Motors. It's quite difficult to fund a private school education and feed his army of children. I remember going on to the school for the entrance exam  and my father said to the priest   it was a Catholic school   he wanted a better  heducation  for the boy  but also  he  my father  never even managed to pass worms  never mind entrance exams. But in order to fund my education  he was going to have to do some dodgy stuff  so my father would fund my education by trading in illicit goods from the back of his car  and that was made even more tricky because my father  that's not his car by the way. My father aspired to have a car like that  but my father had a beaten up Mini  and he never  being a Jamaican coming to this country  he never had a driving license  he never had any insurance or road tax or MOT. He thought   I know how to drive  why do I need the state's validation   But it became a little tricky when we were stopped by the police  and we were stopped a lot by the police  and I was impressed by the way that my father dealt with the police. He would promote the policeman immediately  so that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs in the course of the conversation and wave us on merrily. So my father was exhibiting what we in Jamaica called  playing fool to catch wise.  But it lent also an idea that actually he was being diminished or belittled by the policeman   as a    year old boy  I saw that   but also there was an ambivalence towards authority. So on the one hand  there was a mocking of authority  but on the other hand  there was a deference towards authority  and these Caribbean people had an overbearing obedience towards authority  which is very striking  very strange in a way  because migrants are very courageous people. They leave their homes. My father and my mother left Jamaica and they traveled       miles  and yet they were infantilized by travel. They were timid  and somewhere along the line  the natural order was reversed. The children became the parents to the parent. The Caribbean people came to this country with a five year plan  they would work  some money  and then go back  but the five years became     the    became     and before you know it  you're changing the wallpaper  and at that point  you know you're here to stay. Although there's still the kind of temporariness that our parents felt about being here  but we children knew that the game was up. I think there was a feeling that they would not be able to continue with the ideals of the life that they expected. The reality was very much different. And also  that was true of the reality of trying to educate me. Having started the process  my father did not continue. It was left to my mother to educate me  and as George Lamming would say  it was my mother who fathered me. Even in his absence  that old mantra remained  You are being watched. But such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety  so much so that years later  when I was investigating why so many young black men were diagnosed with schizophrenia  six times more than they ought to be  I was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say   Black people are schooled in paranoia.  And I wonder what Bageye would make of that. Now I also had a    year old son  and turned my attention to Bageye and I went in search of him. He was back in Luton  he was now     and I hadn't seen him for    odd years  and when he opened the door  I saw this tiny little man with lambent  smiling eyes  and he was smiling  and I'd never seen him smile. I was very disconcerted by that. But we sat down  and he had a Caribbean friend with him  talking some old time talk  and my father would look at me  and he looked at me as if I would miraculously disappear as I had arisen. And he turned to his friend  and he said   This boy and me have a deep  deep connection  deep  deep connection.  But I never felt that connection. If there was a pulse  it was very weak or hardly at all. And I almost felt in the course of that reunion that I was auditioning to be my father's son. When the book came out  it had fair reviews in the national papers  but the paper of choice in Luton is not The Guardian  it's the Luton News  and the Luton News ran the headline about the book   The Book That May Heal a    Year Old Rift.  And I understood that could also represent the rift between one generation and the next  between people like me and my father's generation  but there's no tradition in Caribbean life of memoirs or biographies. It was a tradition that you didn't chat about your business in public. But I welcomed that title  and I thought actually  yes  there is a possibility that this will open up conversations that we'd never had before. This will close the generation gap  perhaps. This could be an instrument of repair. And I even began to feel that this book may be perceived by my father as an act of filial devotion. Poor  deluded fool. Bageye was stung by what he perceived to be the public airing of his shortcomings. He was stung by my betrayal  and he went to the newspapers the next day and demanded a right of reply  and he got it with the headline  Bageye Bites Back.  And it was a coruscating account of my betrayal. I was no son of his. He recognized in his mind that his colors had been dragged through the mud  and he couldn't allow that. He had to restore his dignity  and he did so  and initially  although I was disappointed  I grew to admire that stance. There was still fire bubbling through his veins  even though he was    years old. And if it meant that we would now return to    years of silence  my father would say   If it's so  then it's so.  Jamaicans will tell you that there's no such thing as facts  there are only versions. We all tell ourselves the versions of the story that we can best live with. Each generation builds up an edifice which they are reluctant or sometimes unable to disassemble  but in the writing  my version of the story began to change  and it was detached from me. I lost my hatred of my father. I did no longer want him to die or to murder him  and I felt free  much freer than I'd ever felt before. And I wonder whether that freedness could be transferred to him. In that initial reunion  I was struck by an idea that I had very few photographs of myself as a young child. This is a photograph of me  nine months old. In the original photograph  I'm being held up by my father  Bageye  but when my parents separated  my mother excised him from all aspects of our lives. She took a pair of scissors and cut  him out of every photograph  and for years  I told myself the truth of this photograph was that you are alone  you are unsupported. But there's another way of looking at this photograph. This is a photograph that has the potential for a reunion  a potential to be reunited with my father  and in my yearning to be held up by my father  I held him up to the light. In that first reunion  it was very awkward and tense moments  and to lessen the tension  we decided to go for a walk. And as we walked  I was struck that I had reverted to being the child even though I was now towering above my father. I was almost a foot taller than my father. He was still the big man  and I tried to match his step. And I realized that he was walking as if he was still under observation  but I admired his walk. He walked like a man on the losing side of the F.A. Cup Final mounting the steps to collect his condolence medal. There was dignity in defeat. Thank you. On November  th        a man named El Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane  the leader of the Jewish Defense League. Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder  but while serving time on lesser charges  he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks  including tunnels  synagogues and the United Nations headquarters. Thankfully  those plans were foiled by an FBI informant. Sadly  the      bombing of the World Trade Center was not. Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot. El Sayyid Nosair is my father. I was born in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania in      to him  an Egyptian engineer  and a loving American mother and grade school teacher  who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me. It wasn't until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change. My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people  including the majority of Muslims  get to see. It's been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another  it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part  we all want the same things out of life. However  in every religion  in every population  you'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do. A few months prior to his arrest  he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends  he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice. He told me I'd be going with him the next morning. We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range  which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI. When it was my turn to shoot  my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about    yards off. That day  the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone's surprise  especially mine  the entire target burst into flames. My uncle turned to the other men  and in Arabic said   Ibn abuh.  Like father  like son. They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment  but it wasn't until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny. They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of. Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with       pounds of explosives into the sub level parking lot of the World Trade Center's North Tower  causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over       others. These were the men I looked up to. These were the men I called ammu  which means uncle. By the time I turned     I had already moved    times in my life  and that instability during my childhood didn't really provide an opportunity to make many friends. Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone  it was time to pack up and move to the next town. Being the perpetual new face in class  I was frequently the target of bullies. I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted  but as it turns out  being the quiet  chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition. So for the most part  I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games. For those reasons  my social skills were lacking  to say the least  and growing up in a bigoted household  I wasn't prepared for the real world. I'd been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements  like a person's race or religion. So what opened my eyes  One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the      presidential elections. Through a college prep program  I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia. My particular group's focus was on youth violence  and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life  this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate. The members of our group came from many different walks of life. One day toward the end of the convention  I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish. Now  it had taken several days for this detail to come to light  and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us. I had never had a Jewish friend before  and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable. Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens  an amusement park. There  I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures  and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character. Most of my life  I'd been taught that homosexuality was a sin  and by extension  that all gay people were a negative influence. As chance would have it  I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there  and soon found that many were the kindest  least judgmental people I had ever met. Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others  and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated. Because of that feeling  I was able to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction. I don't know what it's like to be gay  but I'm well acquainted with being judged for something that's beyond my control. Then there was  The Daily Show.  On a nightly basis  Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person's race  religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one's character. He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one. Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place  and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me. One day  I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change  and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live. She looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime  and said   I'm tired of hating people.  In that instant  I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you. Zak Ebrahim is not my real name. I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life. So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger  Well  that's simple. I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way  that although I had been subjected to this violent  intolerant ideology  that I did not become fanaticized. Instead  I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism  against the bigotry. I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones  for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives. For the victims of terrorism  I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father's actions. And with that simple fact  I stand here as proof that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race  and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father. I am not my father. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you  everybody.  Applause  Thank you all.  Applause  Thanks a lot.  Applause  My dream is to build the world's first underground park in New York City. Now  why would someone want to build an underground park  and why in New York City  These three tough little buggers are  on the left  my grandmother  age five  and then her sister and brother  ages    and nine. This photo was taken just before they left from Italy to immigrate to the United States  just about a century ago. And like many immigrants at the time  they arrived on the Lower East Side in New York City and they encountered a crazy melting pot. What was amazing about their generation was that they were not only building new lives in this new  unfamiliar area  but they were also literally building the city. I've always been fascinated by those decades and by that history  and I would often beg my grandmother to tell me as many stories as possible about the old New York. But she would often just shrug it off  tell me to eat more meatballs  more pasta  and so I very rarely got any of the history that I wanted to hear about. The New York City that I encountered felt pretty built up. I always knew as a kid that I wanted to make a difference  and to somehow make the world more beautiful  more interesting and more just. I just didn't really know how. At first  I thought I wanted to go work abroad  so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya. But it felt weird to me that I knew more about local Kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown. I took a job with the City of New York  but very quickly felt frustrated with the slowness of government bureaucracy. I even took a job at Google  where very fast I drank the Kool Aid and believed almost wholeheartedly that technology could solve all social problems. But I still didn't feel like I was making the world a better place. It was in      that my friend and now business partner James Ramsey alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site  which is this. This is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan  and it was open between      and       just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area. And we learned also that the site was entirely abandoned in     . Fascinated by this discovery  we begged the authorities to draw us into the space  and we finally got a tour  and this is what we saw. Now  this photo doesn't really do it justice. It's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space. It's a football field of unused land immediately below a very crowded area of the city  and it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones on an archaeological dig  and all the details are all still there. It's really pretty remarkable. Now  the site itself is located at the very heart of the Lower East Side  and today it still remains one of the most crowded neighborhoods in the city. New York City has two thirds the green space per resident as other big cities  and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space. So we immediately started thinking about how we could take this site and turn it into something that could be used for the public  but also could potentially even be green. Our plan  in a nutshell  is to draw natural sunlight underground using a simple system that harvests sunlight above the street  directs it below the city sidewalks  and would allow plants and trees to grow with the light that's directed underneath. With this approach  you could take a site that looks like this today and transform it into something that looks like this. In       we first released some of these images  and what was funny was  a lot of people said to us   Oh  it kind of looks like the High Line underground.  And so what our nickname ended up becoming  and what ended up sticking  was the Lowline  so the Lowline was born. What was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel  and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible. So  like a crazy person  I decided to quit my job and focus entirely on this project. Here is us with our team putting together a technology demonstration in a warehouse. Here's the underbelly of this solar canopy which we built to show the technology. You can see the six solar collectors at the center there. And here's the full exhibit all put together in this warehouse. You can see the solar canopy overhead  the light streaming in  and this entirely live green space below. So in the course of just a few weeks  tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit  and since that time  we've grown our numbers of supporters both locally and among design enthusiasts all over the world. Here's a rendering of the neighborhood just immediately above the Line's site  and a rendering of how it will look after major redevelopment that is coming over the course of the next    years. Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels and how there's really a lack of green space. So what we're proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood  but more importantly will introduce a really community driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area. And right now  we're focusing very closely on how we engage with the City of New York on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an integrated way. Here's our rendering of how we would actually invite people into the space itself. So here you see this iconic entrance in which we would literally peel up the street and reveal the historical layers of the city  and invite people into this warm underground space. In the middle of winter  when it's absolutely freezing outside  the last place you'd want to go would be an outdoor space or outdoor park. The Lowline would really be a four season space and a respite for the city. So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings my own family's story full circle. If my grandparents and my parents were really focused on building the city up and out  I think my generation is focused on reclaiming the spaces that we already have  rediscovering our shared history  and reimagining how we can make our communities more interesting  more beautiful and more just. Thanks. Hans Rosling  I'm going to ask you three multiple choice questions. Use this device. Use this device to answer. The first question is  how did the number of deaths per year from natural disaster  how did that change during the last century  Did it more than double  did it remain about the same in the world as a whole  or did it decrease to less than half  Please answer A  B or C. I see lots of answers. This is much faster than I do it at universities. They are so slow. They keep thinking  thinking  thinking. Oh  very  very good. And we go to the next question. So how long did women    years old in the world go to school  seven years  five years or three years  A  B or C  Please answer. And we go to the next question. In the last    years  how did the percentage of people in the world who live in extreme poverty change  Extreme poverty   not having  enough food for the day. Did it almost double  did it remain more or less the same  or did it halve  A  B or C  Now  answers. You see  deaths from natural disasters in the world  you can see it from this graph here  from      to     . In       there was about half a million people who died every year from natural disasters  floods  earthquakes  volcanic  eruption  whatever  droughts. And then  how did that change  Gapminder asked the public in Sweden. This is how they answered. The Swedish public answered like this  Fifty percent thought it had doubled     percent said it's more or less the same     said it had halved. This is the best data from the disaster researchers  and it goes up and down  and it goes to the Second World War  and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling and it's down to much less than half. The world has been much  much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this  you know. So only    percent of the Swedes know this. So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps. The chimps don't watch the evening news  so the chimps  they choose by random  so the Swedes answer worse than random. Now how did you do  That's you. You were beaten by the chimps. But it was close. You were three times better than the Swedes  but that's not enough. You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes. You must have higher ambitions in the world. Let's look at the next answer here  women in school. Here  you can see men went eight years. How long did women go to school  Well  we asked the Swedes like this  and that gives you a hint  doesn't it  The right answer is probably the one the fewest Swedes picked  isn't it  Let's see  let's see. Here we come. Yes  yes  yes  women have almost caught up. This is the U.S. public. And this is you. Here you come. Ooh. Well  congratulations  you're twice as good as the Swedes  but you don't need me   So how come  I think it's like this  that everyone is aware that there are countries and there are areas where girls have great difficulties. They are stopped when they go to school  and it's disgusting. But in the majority of the world  where most people in the world live  most countries  girls today go to school as long as boys  more or less. That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved  not at all. They still are confined to terrible  terrible limitations  but schooling is there in the world today. Now  we miss the majority. When you answer  you answer according to the worst places  and there you are right  but you miss the majority. What about poverty  Well  it's very clear that poverty here was almost halved  and in U.S.  when we asked the public  only five percent got it right. And you  Ah  you almost made it to the chimps. That little  just a few of you  There must be preconceived ideas  you know. And many in the rich countries  they think that oh  we can never end extreme poverty. Of course they think so  because they don't even know what has happened. The first thing to think about the future is to know about the present. These questions were a few of the first ones in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project in Gapminder Foundation that we run  and it was started  this project  last year by my boss  and also my son  Ola Rosling.  Laughter  He's cofounder and director  and he wanted  Ola told me we have to be more systematic when we fight devastating ignorance. So already the pilots reveal this  that so many in the public score worse than random  so we have to think about preconceived ideas  and one of the main preconceived ideas is about world income distribution. Look here. This is how it was in     . It's the number of people on each income  from one dollar a day   See  there was one hump here  around one dollar a day  and then there was one hump here somewhere between    and     dollars. The world was two groups. It was a camel world  like a camel with two humps  the poor ones and the rich ones  and there were fewer in between. But look how this has changed  As I go forward  what has changed  the world population has grown  and the humps start to merge. The lower humps merged with the upper hump  and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world with one hump only. The percent in poverty has decreased. Still it's appalling that so many remain in extreme poverty. We still have this group  almost a billion  over there  but that can be ended now. The challenge we have now is to get away from that  understand where the majority is  and that is very clearly shown in this question. We asked  what is the percentage of the world's one year old children who have got those basic vaccines against measles and other things that we have had for many years         or    percent  Now  this is what the U.S. public and the Swedish answered. Look at the Swedish result  you know what the right answer is. Who the heck is a professor of global health in that country  Well  it's me. It's me. It's very difficult  this. It's very difficult. However  Ola's approach to really measure what we know made headlines  and CNN published these results on their web and they had the questions there  millions answered  and I think there were about       comments  and this was one of the comments.  I bet no member of the media passed the test   he said. So Ola told me   Take these devices. You are invited to media conferences. Give it to them and measure what the media know.  And ladies and gentlemen  for the first time  the informal results from a conference with U.S. media. And then  lately  from the European Union media. You see  the problem is not that people don't read and listen to the media. The problem is that the media doesn't know themselves. What shall we do about this  Ola  Do we have any ideas  Ola Rosling  Yes  I have an idea  but first  I'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps. Fortunately  I will be able to comfort you by showing why it was not your fault  actually. Then  I will equip you with some tricks for beating the chimps in the future. That's basically what I will do. But first  let's look at why are we so ignorant  and it all starts in this place. It's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden. It's a neighborhood where I grew up  and it's a neighborhood with a large problem. Actually  it has exactly the same problem which existed in all the neighborhoods where you grew up as well. It was not representative. Okay  It gave me a very biased view of how life is on this planet. So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle. We have a personal bias. We have all different experiences from communities and people we meet  and on top of this  we start school  and we add the next problem. Well  I like schools  but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews  because they learned something when they went to school  and now they describe this world to the students without any bad intentions  and those books  of course  that are printed are outdated in a world that changes. And there is really no practice to keep the teaching material up to date. So that's what we are focusing on. So we have these outdated facts added on top of our personal bias. What happens next is news  okay  An excellent journalist knows how to pick the story that will make headlines  and people will read it because it's sensational. Unusual events are more interesting  no  And they are exaggerated  and especially things we're afraid of. A shark attack on a Swedish person will get headlines for weeks in Sweden. So these three skewed sources of information were really hard to get away from. They kind of bombard us and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas  and on top of it we put the very thing that makes us humans  our human intuition. It was good in evolution. It helped us generalize and jump to conclusions very  very fast. It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of  and we seek causality where there is none  and we then get an illusion of confidence where we believe that we are the best car drivers  above the average. Everybody answered that question   Yeah  I drive cars better.  Okay  this was good evolutionarily  but now when it comes to the worldview  it is the exact reason why it's upside down. The trends that are increasing are instead falling  and the other way around  and in this case  the chimps use our intuition against us  and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength. It was supposed to be our strength  wasn't it  So how do we solve such problems  First  we need to measure it  and then we need to cure it. So by measuring it we can understand what is the pattern of ignorance. We started the pilot last year  and now we're pretty sure that we will encounter a lot of ignorance across the whole world  and the idea is really to scale it up to all domains or dimensions of global development  such as climate  endangered species  human rights  gender equality  energy  finance. All different sectors have facts  and there are organizations trying to spread awareness about these facts. So I've started actually contacting some of them  like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF  and asking them  what are your favorite facts which you think the public doesn't know  Okay  I gather those facts. Imagine a long list with  say      facts. And then we poll the public and see where they score worst. So we get a shorter list with the terrible results  like some few examples from Hans  and we have no problem finding these kinds of terrible results. Okay  this little shortlist  what are we going to do with it  Well  we turn it into a knowledge certificate  a global knowledge certificate  which you can use  if you're a large organization  a school  a university  or maybe a news agency  to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable. Basically meaning  we don't hire people who score like chimpanzees. Of course you shouldn't. So maybe    years from now  if this project succeeds  you will be sitting in an interview having to fill out this crazy global knowledge. So now we come to the practical tricks. How are you going to succeed  There is  of course  one way  which is to sit down late nights and learn all the facts by heart by reading all these reports. That will never happen  actually. Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen. People don't have that time. People like shortcuts  and here are the shortcuts. We need to turn our intuition into strength again. We need to be able to generalize. So now I'm going to show you some tricks where the misconceptions are turned around into rules of thumb. Let's start with the first misconception. This is very widespread. Everything is getting worse. You heard it. You thought it yourself. The other way to think is  most things improve. So you're sitting with a question in front of you and you're unsure. You should guess  improve.  Okay  Don't go for the worse. That will help you score better on our tests. That was the first one. There are rich and poor and the gap is increasing. It's a terrible inequality. Yeah  it's an unequal world  but when you look at the data  it's one hump. Okay  If you feel unsure  go for  the most people are in the middle.  That's going to help you get the answer right. Now  the next preconceived idea is first countries and people need to be very  very rich to get the social development like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters. No  no  no. That's wrong. Look  that huge hump in the middle already have girls in school. So if you are unsure  go for the  the majority already have this   like electricity and girls in school  these kinds of things. They're only rules of thumb  so of course they don't apply to everything  but this is how you can generalize. Let's look at the last one. If something  yes  this is a good one  sharks are dangerous. No   well  yes  but they are not so important in the global statistics  that is what I'm saying. I actually  I'm very afraid of sharks. So as soon as I see a question about things I'm afraid of  which might be earthquakes  other religions  maybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks  anything that makes me feel  assume you're going to exaggerate the problem. That's a rule of thumb. Of course there are dangerous  things that are also great. Sharks kill very  very few. That's how you should think. With these four rules of thumb  you could probably answer better than the chimps  because the chimps cannot do this. They cannot generalize these kinds of rules. And hopefully we can turn your world around and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay  That's a systematic approach. Now the question  is this important  Yeah  it's important to understand poverty  extreme poverty and how to fight it  and how to bring girls in school. When we realize that actually it's succeeding  we can understand it. But is it important for everyone else who cares about the rich end of this scale  I would say yes  extremely important  for the same reason. If you have a fact based worldview of today  you might have a chance to understand what's coming next in the future. We're going back to these two humps in     . That's when I was born  and I selected the West. That's the current EU countries and North America. Let's now see how the rest and the West compares in terms of how rich you are. These are the people who can afford to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation. In       only    percent of them lived outside EU and North America. But this has changed  okay  So first  let's look at the change up till today      . Today it's      . The Western domination is over  as of today. That's nice. So what's going to happen next  Do you see the big hump  Did you see how it moved  I did a little experiment. I went to the IMF  International Monetary Fund  website. They have a forecast for the next  five years of GDP per capita. So I can use that to go five years into the future  assuming the income inequality  of each country is the same. I did that  but I went even further. I used those five years for the next    years with the same speed  just as an  experiment what might actually happen. Let's move into the future. In       it's    percent in the rest. In          percent.         . And in       the West is  outnumbered in the rich consumer market. These are just projections of  GDP per capita into the future. Seventy three percent of the rich consumers are going to live outside North America and Europe. So yes  I think it's a good idea for  a company to use this certificate to make sure to make fact  based decisions in the future. Thank you very much. Bruno Giussani  Hans and Ola Rosling  Good afternoon. My name is Uldus. I am a photo based artist from Russia. I started my way around six years ago with ironic self portraits to lay open so many stereotypes about nationalities  genders  and social issues     I am Russian. I sell drugs  guns  porno with kids      Vodka   water. I love vodka     Laughter    using photography as my tool to send a message.   Marry me  I need a visa.   Today  I am still performing in front of the camera and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman. I focus on balancing meaningful message  aesthetic  beauty  composition   some irony  and artifacts. Today  I'm going to tell you about my project  which is named Desperate Romantics. They're my artifacts  or paintings from pre Raphaelites Brotherhood England mid   th century. I took the painting and gifted new  contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in Russia  capturing people who are non models but have an interesting story. This boy is a professional dancer  only    years old  but at secondary school  he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality  trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality. But this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted  because being different isn't easy  especially in Russia. Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric. And this is Nikita  a security guard from one of the bars in St. Petersburg. He likes to say   You wouldn't like me when I'm angry   quoting Hulk from the movie  but I've never seen him angry. He hides his sensitivities and romantic side  because in Russia  among guys  that's not cool to be romantic  but it's cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk. Sometimes  in my project  I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it. Sometimes  I would compare facial features and playing with words  irony  Iron Man  ironing man. Through the artifacts  I bring social issues which surround me in Russia into the conversation. Interesting fact about marriage in Russia  that most of the        year old girls are already ready  and dream to get married. We're taught from childhood  successful marriage means successful life  so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband. And what about me  I'm    years old. For Russian society  I'm an old maid and hopeless to ever get married. That's why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask  in the wedding dress  all desperate in my garden. But remember  irony is the key  and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for goals  for dreams  and change stereotypes. Be brave. Be ironic   it helps. Be funny and create some magic. For over a decade as a doctor  I've cared for homeless veterans  for working class families. I've cared for people who  live and work in conditions that can be hard  if not harsh  and that work has led me to believe that we need a fundamentally different way of looking at healthcare. We simply need a healthcare system that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms that bring people into clinics  but instead actually is able to look and improve health where it begins. And where health begins is not in the four walls of a doctor's office  but where we live and where we work  where we eat  sleep  learn and play  where we spend the majority of our lives. So what does this different  approach to healthcare look like  an approach that can improve health where it begins  To illustrate this  I'll tell you about Veronica. Veronica was the   th patient out of my    patient day at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles. She came into our clinic with a chronic headache. This headache had been going on for a number of years  and this particular episode was very  very troubling. In fact  three weeks before she came to visit us for the first time  she went to an  emergency room in Los Angeles. The emergency room doctors said   We've run some tests  Veronica. The results are normal  so here's some pain medication  and follow up with a primary care doctor  but if the pain persists or if it worsens  then come on back.  Veronica followed those standard instructions and she went back. She went back not just once  but twice more. In the three weeks before Veronica met us  she went to the emergency room three times. She went back and forth  in and out of hospitals and clinics  just like she had done in years past  trying to seek relief but still coming up short. Veronica came to our clinic  and despite all these encounters with healthcare professionals  Veronica was still sick. When she came to our clinic  though   we tried a different approach. Our approach started with our medical assistant  someone who had a GED level training but knew the community. Our medical assistant asked some routine questions. She asked   What's your chief complaint    Headache.   Let's get your vital signs    measure your blood pressure and your heart rate  but let's also ask something equally as vital to Veronica and a lot of patients like her in South Los Angeles.  Veronica  can you tell me about where you live  Specifically  about your housing conditions  Do you have mold  Do you have water leaks  Do you have roaches in your home   Turns out  Veronica said yes to three of those things  roaches  water leaks  mold. I received that chart in hand  reviewed it  and I turned the handle on the door and I entered the room. You should understand that Veronica  like a lot of patients that I have the privilege of caring for  is a dignified person  a formidable presence  a personality that's larger than life  but here she was doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table. Her head  clearly throbbing  was resting in her hands. She lifted her head up  and I saw her face  said hello  and then I immediately noticed something across the bridge of her nose  a crease in her skin. In medicine  we call that crease the allergic salute. It's usually seen among children who have chronic allergies. It comes from chronically rubbing one's nose up and down  trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms  and yet  here was Veronica  a grown woman  with the same telltale sign of allergies. A few minutes later  in asking Veronica some questions  and examining her and listening to her  I said   Veronica  I think I know what you have. I think you have chronic allergies  and I think you have migraine headaches and some sinus congestion  and I think all of those are  related to where you live.  She looked a little bit relieved  because for the first time  she had a diagnosis  but I said   Veronica  now let's talk about your treatment. We're going to order some medications for your symptoms  but I also want to refer you to a specialist  if that's okay.  Now  specialists are a little hard to find in South Central Los Angeles  so she gave me this look  like   Really   And I said   Veronica  actually  the specialist I'm talking about is someone I call a community health worker  someone who  if it's okay with you  can come to your home and try to understand what's going on with those water leaks and that mold  trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms  and if required  that specialist might refer you to another specialist that we call a public interest lawyer  because it might be that your landlord isn't making the fixes he's required to make.  Veronica came back in a few months later. She agreed to all of those treatment plans. She told us that her symptoms had improved by    percent. She was spending more time at work and with her family and less time shuttling back and forth between the emergency rooms of Los Angeles. Veronica had improved remarkably. Her sons  one of whom had asthma  were no longer as sick as they used to be. She had gotten better  and not coincidentally  Veronica's home was better too. What was it about this different approach we tried that led to better care  fewer visits to the E.R.  better health  Well  quite simply  it started with that question   Veronica  where do you live   But more importantly  it was that we put in place a system that allowed us to routinely ask questions to Veronica and hundreds more like her about the conditions that mattered in her community  about where health  and unfortunately sometimes illness  do begin in places like South L.A. In that community  substandard housing and food insecurity are the major conditions that we as a clinic had to be aware of  but in other communities it could be transportation barriers  obesity  access to parks  gun violence. The important thing is  we put in place a system that worked  and it's an approach that I call an upstream approach. It's a term many of you are familiar with. It comes from a parable that's very common in the public health community. This is a parable of three friends. Imagine that you're one of these three friends who come to a river. It's a beautiful scene  but it's shattered by the cries of a child  and actually several children  in need of rescue in the water. So you do hopefully what everybody would do. You jump right in along with your friends. The first friend says  I'm going to rescue those who are about to drown  those at most risk of falling over the waterfall. The second friends says  I'm going to build a raft. I'm going to make sure that fewer people need to end up at the waterfall's edge. Let's usher more people to safety by building this raft  coordinating those branches together. Over time  they're successful  but not really  as much as they want to be. More people slip through  and they finally look up and they see that their third friend is nowhere to be seen. They finally spot her. She's in the water. She's swimming away from them upstream  rescuing children as she goes  and they shout to her   Where are you going  There are children here to save.  And she says back   I'm going to find out who or what is throwing these children in the water.  In healthcare  we have that first friend   we have the specialist  we have the trauma surgeon  the ICU nurse  the E.R. doctors. We have those people that are vital rescuers  people you want to be there when you're in dire straits. We also know that we have the second friend   we have that raft builder. That's the primary care clinician  people on the care team who are there to manage your chronic conditions  your diabetes  your hypertension  there to give you your annual checkups  there to make sure your vaccines are up to date  but also there to make sure that you have a raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety. But while that's also vital and very necessary  what we're missing is that third friend. We don't have enough of that upstreamist. The upstreamists are the health care professionals who know that health does begin where we live and work and play  but beyond that awareness  is able to mobilize the resources to create the system in their clinics and in their hospitals that really does start to approach that  to connect people to the resources they need outside the four walls of the clinic. Now you might ask  and it's  a very obvious question that a lot of colleagues in medicine ask   Doctors and nurses thinking about transportation and housing  Shouldn't we just provide pills and procedures and just make sure we focus on the task at hand   Certainly  rescuing people at the water's edge is important enough work. Who has the time  I would argue  though  that if we were to use science as our guide  that we would find an upstream approach is absolutely necessary. Scientists now know that the living and working conditions that we all are part of have more than twice the impact on our health than does our genetic code  and living and working conditions  the structures of our environments  the ways in which our social fabric is woven together  and the impact those have on our behaviors  all together  those have more than five times the impact on our health than do all the pills and procedures administered by doctors and hospitals combined. All together  living and working conditions account for    percent of preventable death. Let me give you an example of what this feels like. Let's say there was a company  a tech startup that came to you and said   We have a great product. It's going to lower your risk of death from heart disease.  Now  you might be likely to invest if that product was a drug or a device  but what if that product was a park  A study in the U.K.  a landmark study that reviewed the records of over    million residents in the U.K.  looked at several variables  controlled for a lot of factors  and found that when trying to adjust the risk of heart disease  one's exposure to green space was a powerful influence. The closer you were to green space  to parks and trees  the lower your chance of heart disease  and that stayed true for rich and for poor. That study illustrates what my friends in public health often say these days  that one's zip code matters more than your genetic code. We're also learning that zip code is actually shaping our genetic code. The science of epigenetics looks at those molecular mechanisms  those intricate ways in which our DNA is literally shaped  genes turned on and off based on the exposures to the environment  to where we live and to where we work. So it's clear that these factors  these upstream issues  do matter. They matter to our health  and therefore our healthcare professionals should do something about it. And yet  Veronica asked me perhaps the most compelling question I've been asked in a long time. In that follow up visit  she said   Why did none of my doctors ask about my home before  In those visits to the emergency room  I had two CAT scans  I had a needle placed in the lower part of my back to collect spinal fluid  I had nearly a dozen blood tests. I went back and forth  I saw all sorts of people in healthcare  and no one asked about my home.  The honest answer is that in healthcare  we often treat symptoms without addressing the conditions that make you sick in the first place. And there are many reasons for that  but the big three are first  we don't pay for that. In healthcare  we often pay  for volume and not value. We pay doctors and hospitals usually for the number of services they provide  but not necessarily on how healthy they make you. That leads to a second phenomenon that I call the  don't ask  don't tell  approach to upstream issues in healthcare. We don't ask about where you live and where you work  because if there's a problem there  we don't know what to tell you. It's not that doctors don't know these are important issues. In a recent survey done in the U.S. among physicians  over       physicians     percent of them actually said that they know that their patients' upstream problems are as important as their health issues  as their medical problems  and yet despite that widespread awareness of the importance of upstream issues  only one in five doctors said they had any sense of confidence to address those issues  to improve health where it begins. There's this gap between knowing that patients' lives  the context of where they live and work  matters  and the ability to do something about it in the systems in which we work. This is a huge problem right now  because it leads them to this next question  which is  whose responsibility is it  And that brings me to that third point  that third answer to Veronica's compelling question. Part of the reason that we have this conundrum is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists in the healthcare system. There are not nearly enough of that third friend  that person who is going to find out who or what is throwing those kids in the water. Now  there are many upstreamists  and I've had the privilege of meeting many of them  in Los Angeles and in other parts of the country and around the world  and it's important to note that upstreamists sometimes are doctors  but they need not be. They can be nurses  other clinicians  care managers  social workers. It's not so important what specific degree upstreamists have at the end of their name. What's more important is that they all seem to share the same ability to implement a process that transforms their assistance  transforms the way they practice medicine. That process is a quite simple process. It's one  two and three. First  they sit down and they say  let's identify the clinical problem among a certain set of patients. Let's say  for instance  let's try to help children who are bouncing in and out of the hospital with asthma. After identifying the problem  they  then move on to that second step  and they say  let's identify the root cause. Now  a root cause analysis  in healthcare  usually says  well  let's look at your genes  let's look at how you're behaving. Maybe you're not eating healthy enough. Eat healthier. It's a pretty simplistic approach to root cause analyses. It turns out  it doesn't really work when we just limit ourselves that worldview. The root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings to the table is to say  let's look at the living and the working conditions in your life. Perhaps  for children with asthma  it's what's happening in their home  or perhaps they live close to a freeway with major air pollution that triggers their asthma. And perhaps that's what we should mobilize our resources to address  because that third element  that third part of the process  is that next critical part of what upstreamists do. They mobilize the resources to create a solution  both within the clinical system  and then by bringing in people from public health  from other sectors  lawyers  whoever is willing to play ball  let's bring in to create a solution that makes sense  to take those patients who actually have clinical problems and address their root causes together by linking them to the resources you need. It's clear to me that there are so many stories of upstreamists who are doing remarkable things. The problem is that there's just not nearly enough of them out there. By some estimates  we need one upstreamist for every    to    clinicians in the healthcare system. In the U.S.  for instance  that would mean that we need        upstreamists by the year     . But we only have a few thousand upstreamists out there right now  by all accounts  and that's why  a few years ago  my colleagues and I said  you know what  we need to train and make more upstreamists. So we decided to start an organization called Health Begins  and Health Begins simply does that  We train upstreamists. And there are a lot of measures that we use for our success  but the main thing that we're interested in is making sure that we're changing the sense of confidence  that  don't ask  don't tell  metric among clinicians. We're trying to make sure that clinicians  and therefore their systems that they work in have the ability  the confidence to address the problems in the living and working conditions in our lives. We're seeing nearly a tripling of that confidence in our work. It's remarkable  but I'll tell you the most compelling part of what it means to be working with upstreamists to gather them together. What is most compelling is that every day  every week  I hear stories just like Veronica's. There are stories out there of Veronica and many more like her  people who are coming to the healthcare system and getting a glimpse of what it feels like to be part of something that works  a health care system that stops bouncing you back and forth but actually improves your health  listens to you who you are  addresses the context of your life  whether you're rich or poor or middle class. These stories are compelling because not only do they tell us that we're this close to getting the healthcare system that we want  but that there's something that we can all do to get there. Doctors and nurses can get better at asking about the context of patients' lives  not simply because it's better bedside manner  but frankly  because it's a better standard of care. Healthcare systems and payers can start to bring in public health agencies and departments and say  let's look at our data together. Let's see if we can discover some patterns in our data about our patients' lives and see if we can identify an upstream cause  and then  as importantly  can we align the resources to be able to address them  Medical schools  nursing schools  all sorts of health professional education programs can help by training the next generation of upstreamists. We can also make sure that these schools certify a backbone of the upstream approach  and that's the community health worker. We need many more of them in the healthcare system if we're truly going to have it be effective  to move from a sickcare system to a healthcare system. But finally  and perhaps most importantly  what do we do  What do we do as patients  We can start by simply going to our doctors and our nurses  to our clinics  and asking   Is there something in where I live and where I work that I should be aware of   Are there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of  and more importantly  if there are barriers that I'm surfacing  if I'm coming to you and I'm saying I think have a problem with my apartment or at my workplace or I don't have access to transportation  or there's a park that's way too far  so sorry doctor  I can't take your advice to go and jog  if those problems exist  then doctor  are you willing to listen  And what can we do together to improve my health where it begins  If we're all able to do this work  doctors and healthcare systems  payers  and all of us together  we'll realize something about health. Health is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon. Health is a common good. It comes from our personal investment in knowing that our lives matter  the context of where we live and where we work  eat  and sleep  matter  and that what we do for ourselves  we also should do for those whose living and working conditions again  can be hard  if not harsh. We can all invest in making sure that we improve the allocation of resources upstream  but at the same time work together and show that we can move healthcare upstream. We can improve health where it begins. Thank you. So in       an English composer  technologist and astronomer called William Herschel noticed an object on the sky that didn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did. And Herschel's recognition that something was different  that something wasn't quite right  was the discovery of a planet  the planet Uranus  a name that has entertained countless generations of children  but a planet that overnight doubled the size of our known solar system. Just last month  NASA announced the discovery of     new planets in orbit around nearby stars  almost doubling overnight the number of planets we know about within our galaxy. So astronomy is constantly being transformed by this capacity to collect data  and with data almost doubling every year  within the next two decades  me may even reach the point for the first time in history where we've discovered the majority of the galaxies within the universe. But as we enter this era of big data  what we're beginning to find is there's a difference between more data being just better and more data being different  capable of changing the questions we want to ask  and this difference is not about how much data we collect  it's whether those data open new windows into our universe  whether they change the way we view the sky. So what is the next window into our universe  What is the next chapter for astronomy  Well  I'm going to show you some of the tools and the technologies that we're going to develop over the next decade  and how these technologies  together with the smart use of data  may once again transform astronomy by opening up a window into our universe  the window of time. Why time  Well  time is about origins  and it's about evolution. The origins of our solar system  how our solar system came into being  is it unusual or special in any way  About the evolution of our universe. Why our universe is continuing to expand  and what is this mysterious dark energy that drives that expansion  But first  I want to show you how technology is going to change the way we view the sky. So imagine if you were sitting in the mountains of northern Chile looking out to the west towards the Pacific Ocean a few hours before sunrise. This is the view of the night sky that you would see  and it's a beautiful view  with the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon. but it's also a static view  and in many ways  this is the way we think of our universe  eternal and unchanging. But the universe is anything but static. It constantly changes on timescales of seconds to billions of years. Galaxies merge  they collide at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour. Stars are born  they die  they explode in these extravagant displays. In fact  if we could go back to our tranquil skies above Chile  and we allow time to move forward to see how the sky might change over the next year  the pulsations that you see are supernovae  the final remnants of a dying star exploding  brightening and then fading from view  each one of these supernovae five billion times the brightness of our sun  so we can see them to great distances but only for a short amount of time. Ten supernova per second explode somewhere in our universe. If we could hear it  it would be popping like a bag of popcorn. Now  if we fade out the supernovae  it's not just brightness that changes. Our sky is in constant motion. This swarm of objects you see streaming across the sky are asteroids as they orbit our sun  and it's these changes and the motion and it's the dynamics of the system that allow us to build our models for our universe  to predict its future and to explain its past. But the telescopes we've used over the last decade are not designed to capture the data at this scale. The Hubble Space Telescope  for the last    years it's been producing some of the most detailed views of our distant universe  but if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image of the sky  it would take    million individual images  about     years to do this just once. So this is driving us to new technologies and new telescopes  telescopes that can go faint to look at the distant universe but also telescopes that can go wide to capture the sky as rapidly as possible  telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope  or the LSST  possibly the most boring name ever for one of the most fascinating experiments in the history of astronomy  in fact proof  if you should need it  that you should never allow  a scientist or an engineer to name anything  not even your children.  Laughter  We're building the LSST. We expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade. I'm going to show you how we think it's going to transform  our views of the universe  because one image from the LSST is equivalent to       images from the Hubble Space Telescope  each image three and a half degrees on the sky  seven times the width of the full moon. Well  how do you capture an image at this scale  Well  you build the largest digital camera in history  using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone or in the digital cameras you  can buy in the High Street  but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across  about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle  where one image is three billion pixels. So if you wanted to look at an image in its full resolution  just a single LSST image  it would take about        high definition TV screens. And this camera will image the sky  taking a new picture every    seconds  constantly scanning the sky so every three nights  we'll get a completely new view of the skies above Chile. Over the mission lifetime of this telescope  it will detect    billion stars and galaxies  and that will be for the first time we'll have detected more objects in our universe than people on the Earth. Now  we can talk about this in terms of terabytes and petabytes and billions of objects  but a way to get a sense of the amount of data that will come off this camera is that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded simultaneously     hours a day  seven days a week  for    years. And to process this data means searching through all of those talks for every new idea and every new concept  looking at each part of the video to see how one frame may have changed from the next. And this is changing the way that we do science  changing the way that we do astronomy  to a place where software and algorithms have to mine through this data  where the software is as critical to the science as the telescopes and the  cameras that we've built. Now  thousands of discoveries will come from this project  but I'm just going to tell you about two of the ideas about origins and evolution that may be transformed by our access to data at this scale. In the last five years  NASA has discovered over       planetary systems around nearby stars  but the systems we're finding aren't much like our own solar system  and one of the questions we face is is it just that we haven't been looking hard enough or is there something special or unusual about how our solar system formed  And if we want to answer that question  we have to know and understand the history of our solar system in detail  and it's the details that are crucial. So now  if we look back at the sky  at our asteroids that were streaming across the sky  these asteroids are like the debris of our solar system. The positions of the asteroids are like a fingerprint of an earlier time when the orbits of Neptune and Jupiter were much closer to the sun  and as these giant planets migrated through our solar system  they were scattering the asteroids in their wake. So studying the asteroids is like performing forensics  performing forensics on our solar system  but to do this  we need distance  and we get the distance from the motion  and we get the motion because of our access to time. So what does this tell us  Well  if you look at the little yellow asteroids flitting across the screen  these are the asteroids that are moving fastest  because they're closest to us  closest to Earth. These are the asteroids we may one day send spacecraft to  to mine them for minerals  but they're also the asteroids that may one day impact the Earth  like happened    million years ago with the extinction of the dinosaurs  or just at the beginning of the last century  when an asteroid wiped out almost       square miles of Siberian forest  or even just last year  as one burnt up over Russia  releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb. So studying the forensics of our solar system doesn't just tell us about the past  it can also predict the future   including our future. Now when we get distance  we get to see the asteroids  in their natural habitat  in orbit around the sun. So every point in this visualization that you can see is a real asteroid. Its orbit has been calculated from its motion across the sky. The colors reflect the composition of these asteroids  dry and stony in the center  water rich and primitive towards the edge  water rich asteroids which may have seeded the oceans and the seas that we find on our planet when they bombarded the  Earth at an earlier time. Because the LSST will be able to go faint and not just wide  we will be able to see these asteroids far beyond the inner part of our solar system  to asteroids beyond the  orbits of Neptune and Mars  to comets and asteroids that may exist almost a light year from our sun. And as we increase the detail of this picture  increasing the detail by factors of    to      we will be able to answer questions such as  is there evidence for planets outside the orbit of Neptune  to find Earth impacting asteroids long before they're a danger  and to find out whether  maybe  our sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars  and maybe it's this sun's stellar siblings that influenced the formation of our solar system  and maybe that's one of the reasons why  solar systems like ours seem to be so rare. Now  distance and changes in our universe   distance equates to time  as well as changes on the sky. Every foot of distance you look away  or every foot of distance an object is away  you're looking back about a billionth of a second in time  and this idea or this notion of looking back in time has revolutionized our ideas about the universe  not once but multiple times. The first time was in       when an astronomer called Edwin Hubble showed that the universe was expanding  leading to the ideas of the Big Bang. And the observations were simple  just    galaxies and a hand drawn picture. But just the idea that the more distant a galaxy  the faster it was receding  was enough to give rise to modern cosmology. A second revolution happened    years later  when two groups of astronomers showed that the universe wasn't just expanding  it was accelerating  a surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky and finding out the higher that it gets  the faster it moves away. And they showed this by measuring the brightness of supernovae  and how the brightness of the supernovae got fainter with distance. And these observations were more complex. They required new technologies and new telescopes  because the supernovae were in galaxies that were       times more distant than the ones used by Hubble. And it took three years to find just    supernovae  because a supernova only explodes once every hundred years within a galaxy. Three years to find    supernovae by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies. And once they'd collected their data  this is what they found. Now  this may not look impressive  but this is what a revolution in physics looks like  a line predicting the brightness of a supernova    billion light years away  and a handful of points that don't quite fit that line. Small changes give rise to big consequences. Small changes allow us to make discoveries  like the planet found by Herschel. Small changes turn our understanding of the universe on its head. So    supernovae  slightly too faint  meaning slightly further away  requiring that a universe must not just be expanding  but this expansion must be accelerating  revealing a component of our universe which we now call dark energy  a component that drives this expansion and makes up    percent of the energy budget of our universe today. So what is the next revolution likely to be  Well  what is dark energy and why does it exist  Each of these lines shows a different model for what dark energy might be  showing the properties of dark energy. They all are consistent with the    points  but the ideas behind these lines are dramatically different. Some people think about a dark energy that changes with time  or whether the properties of the dark energy are different depending on where you look on the sky. Others make differences and changes to the physics at the sub atomic level. Or  they look at large scales and change how gravity and general relativity work  or they say our universe is just one of many  part of this mysterious multiverse  but all of these ideas  all of these theories  amazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy  but all of them consistent with our    points. So how can we hope to make sense of this over the next decade  Well  imagine if I gave you a pair of dice  and I said you wanted to see whether those dice were loaded or fair. One roll of the dice would tell you very little  but the more times you rolled them  the more data you collected  the more confident you would become  not just whether they're loaded or fair  but by how much  and in what way. It took three years to find just    supernovae because the telescopes that we built could only survey a small part of the sky. With the LSST  we get a completely new view of the skies above Chile every three nights. In its first night of operation  it will find    times the number of supernovae used in the discovery of dark energy. This will increase by       within the first four months   .  million supernovae by the end of its survey  each supernova a roll of the dice  each supernova testing which theories of dark energy are consistent  and which ones are not. And so  by combining these supernova data with other measures of cosmology  we'll progressively rule out the different ideas and theories of dark energy until hopefully at the end of this survey around       we would expect to hopefully see a theory for our universe  a fundamental theory for the physics of our universe  to gradually emerge. Now  in many ways  the questions that I posed are in reality the simplest of questions. We may not know the answers  but we at least know how to ask the questions. But if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies revealed    supernovae that turned our understanding of the universe on its head  when we're working with billions of galaxies  how many more times are we going to find    points that don't quite match what we expect  Like the planet found by Herschel or dark energy or quantum mechanics or general relativity  all ideas that came because the data didn't quite match what we expected. What's so exciting about the next decade of data in astronomy is  we don't even know how many answers are out there waiting  answers about our origins and our evolution. How many answers are out there that we don't even know the questions that we want to ask  Thank you. Hi everybody. So my name is Mac. My job is that I lie to children  but they're honest lies. I write children's books  and there's a quote from Pablo Picasso   We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is  given us to understand. The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the  truthfulness of his lies.  I first heard this when I was a kid  and I loved it  but I had no idea what it meant. So I thought  you know what  it's what I'm here to talk to you today about  though  truth and lies  fiction and reality. So how could I untangle this knotted bunch of sentences  And I said  I've got PowerPoint. Let's do a Venn diagram.   Truth. Lies.    Laughter  So there it is  right there  boom. We've got truth and lies and then there's this little space  the edge  in the middle. That liminal space  that's art. All right. Venn diagram.  Laughter   Applause  But that's actually not very helpful either. The thing that made me understand that quote and really kind of what art  at least the art of fiction  was  was working with kids. I used to be a summer camp counselor. I would do it on my summers off from college  and I loved it. It was a sports summer camp for four  to six year olds. I was in charge of the four year olds  which is good  because four year olds can't play  sports  and neither can I. I play sports at a four year old level  so what would happen is the kids would dribble around some cones  and then got hot  and then they would go sit underneath the tree where I was already sitting    Laughter    and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life. I would tell them about how  on the weekends  I would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England. And soon  other kids who weren't even in my group of kids  they would come up to me  and they would say   You're Mac Barnett  right  You're the guy who spies for the Queen of England.  And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers to come up and ask me that question. In my fantasy  they were svelte Russian women  but  you know  four year olds   you take what you can get in Berkeley  California. And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting. I think the pinnacle of this for  me   I'll never forget this   there was this little girl  named Riley. She was tiny  and she used to always take  out her lunch every day and she would throw out her fruit. She would just take her fruit  her mom packed her a melon every day  and she would just throw it in the ivy and then she would eat fruit snacks and pudding cups  and I was like   Riley  you can't do that  you  have to eat the fruit.  And she was like   Why   And I was like   Well  when you throw the fruit in the ivy  pretty soon  it's going to be overgrown with melons   which is why I think I ended up telling stories to children and not being a nutritionist for children. And so Riley was like   That will never happen. That's not going to happen.  And so  on the last day of camp  I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe from the grocery store and I hid it in the ivy  and then at lunchtime  I was like   Riley  why don't you go over there and see what you've done.  And    Laughter    she went trudging through  the ivy  and then her eyes just got so wide  and she pointed out this melon that was bigger than her head  and then all the kids ran over  there and rushed around her  and one of the kids was like   Hey  why is there a sticker on this   And I was like   That is also why I say do not throw your stickers in the ivy. Put them in the trash can. It ruins nature when you do this.  And Riley carried that melon around with her all day  and she was so proud. And Riley knew she didn't  grow a melon in seven days  but she also knew that she did  and it's a weird place  but it's not just a place that kids can get to. It's anything. Art can get us to that place. She was right in that place in the middle  that place which you could call art or fiction. I'm going to call it wonder. It's what Coleridge called the willing suspension of disbelief or poetic faith  for those moments where a story  no matter how strange  has some semblance of the truth  and then you're able to believe it. It's not just kids who can get there. Adults can too  and we get there when we read. It's why in two days  people will be descending on Dublin to take the walking tour of Bloomsday and see everything that happened in  Ulysses   even though none of that happened. Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street to see Sherlock Holmes' apartment  even though    B is just a number that was painted on a building that never  actually had that address. We know these characters aren't real  but we have real feelings about them  and we're able to do that. We know these characters aren't real  and yet we also know that they are. Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can  and that's why I love writing for kids. I think kids are the best audience for serious literary fiction. When I was a kid  I was obsessed with secret door novels  things like  Narnia   where you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land. And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist and I would look for them and try to go through them. I wanted to live and cross over into  that fictional world  which is   I would always just open people's closet doors.   Laughter  I would just go through my mom's boyfriend's closet  and there was not a secret magical land there. There was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about. And I was happy to tell her all about it. After college  my first job was working behind one of these secret doors. This is a place called     Valencia. It's at     Valencia Street in the Mission in San Francisco  and when I worked there  there was a publishing company headquartered there called McSweeney's  a nonprofit writing center called     Valencia  but then the front of it was a strange shop. You see  this place was zoned retail  and in San Francisco  they were not going to give us a variance  and so the writer who founded it  a writer named Dave Eggers  to come into compliance  with code  he said   Fine  I'm just going to build a pirate supply store.  And that's what he did.  Laughter  And it's beautiful. It's all wood. There's drawers you can pull out and get citrus so you don't get scurvy. They have eyepatches in lots of colors  because when it's springtime  pirates want to go wild. You don't know. Black is boring. Pastel. Or eyes  also in lots of colors  just glass eyes  depending on how you want to deal with that situation. And the store  strangely  people came to them and bought things  and they ended up paying the rent for our tutoring center  which was behind it  but to me  more important was the fact that I think the quality of work you do  kids would come and get instruction in writing  and when you have to walk this weird  liminal  fictional space like this to go do your writing  it's going to affect the kind of work that you make. It's a secret door that you can walk through. So I ran the     in Los Angeles  and it was my job to build the store down there. So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart. That's our motto   Whenever you are  we're already then.  And it's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Our friendly staff is ready to help you. They're from all eras  including just the     s  that guy on the end  he's from the very recent past. There's our Employees of the Month  including Genghis Khan  Charles Dickens. Some great people have come up through our ranks. This is our kind of pharmacy section. We have some patent medicines  Canopic jars for your organs  communist soap that says   This is your soap for the year.   Laughter  Our slushy machine broke on the opening night and  we didn't know what to do. Our architect was covered in red syrup. It looked like he had just murdered somebody  which it was not out of the question for this particular architect  and we didn't know what to do. It was going to be the highlight of our store. So we just put that sign on it that said   Out of order. Come back yesterday.   Laughter  And that ended up being a better joke than slushies  so we just left it there forever. Mammoth Chunks. These things weigh  like  seven pounds each. Barbarian repellent. It's full of salad and potpourri   things that barbarians hate. Dead languages. Leeches  nature's tiny doctors. And Viking Odorant  which comes in lots of great scents  toenails  sweat and rotten vegetables  pyre ash. Because we believe that Axe Body Spray is something that you should only find on the battlefield  not under your arms.  Laughter  And these are robot emotion chips  so robots can feel love or fear. Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude  which we did not expect. We did not think that was going to happen. But there's a nonprofit behind it  and kids go through a door that says  Employees Only  and they end up in this space where they do homework and write stories and make films and this is a book release party where kids will read. There's a quarterly that's published with just writing that's done by the kids who come every day after school  and we have release parties and they eat cake and read for their parents and drink milk out of champagne glasses. And it's a very special space  because it's this weird space in the front. The joke isn't a joke. You can't find the seams on the fiction  and I love that. It's this little bit of fiction that's colonized the real world. I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions. There's a term called metafiction  and that's just stories about stories  and meta's having a moment now. Its last big moment was probably in the     s with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis  but it's been around. It's almost as old as storytelling itself. And one metafictive technique is breaking the fourth wall. Right  It's when an actor will turn to the audience and say   I am an actor  these are just rafters.  And even that supposedly honest moment  I would argue  is in service of the lie  but it's supposed to foreground the artificiality of the fiction. For me  I kind of prefer the opposite. If I'm going to break down the fourth wall  I want fiction to escape and come into the real world. I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality. And so I try to do this in my books. And here's just one example. This is the first book that I ever made. It's called  Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem.  And it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet but it's a punishment and it ruins his life. So it's delivered overnight by FedUp. And he has to take it to school with him. He lives in San Francisco   very tough city to own a blue whale in. A lot of hills  real estate is at a premium. This market's crazy  everybody. But underneath the jacket is this case  and that's the cover underneath the book  the jacket  and there's an ad that offers a free    day risk free trial for a blue whale. And you can just send in a self addressed stamped envelope and we'll send you a whale. And kids do write in. So here's a letter. It says   Dear people  I bet you    bucks you won't send me a blue whale. Eliot Gannon  age   .  So what Eliot and the other kids who send these in get back is a letter in very small print from a Norwegian law firm   that says that due to a change in customs laws  their whale has been held up in Sognefjord  which is a very lovely fjord  and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord and Norwegian food for  a little while. It digresses. But it finishes off by saying that your whale would love to hear from you. He's got a phone number  and you can call and leave him a message. And when you call and leave him a message  you just  on the outgoing message  it's just whale sounds and then a beep  which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound. And they get a picture of their whale too. So this is Randolph  and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in  and I'll play you some of Nico's message. This is the first message I ever got from Nico. I am your owner  Randolph. Hello. So this is the first time I can ever talk to you  and I might talk to you soon another day. Bye. Mac Barnett  So Nico called back  like  an hour later. And here's another one of Nico's messages. I haven't talked to you for a long time  but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday  yeah  Saturday or Sunday  so now I'm calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you're doing right now  and I'm going to probably call you again tomorrow or today  so I'll talk to you later. Bye. MB  So he did  he called back that day again. He's left over    messages for Randolph over four years. You find out all about him and the grandma that he loves and the grandma that  he likes a little bit less   and the crossword puzzles that he does  and this is   I'll play you one  more message from Nico. This is the Christmas message from Nico.  Beep   Audio  Nico  Hello  Randolph  sorry I haven't talked to you in a long time. It's just that I've been so busy because school started  as you might not know  probably  since you're a whale  you don't know  and I'm calling you to just say  to wish you a merry Christmas. So have a nice Christmas  and bye bye  Randolph. Goodbye. MB  I actually got Nico  I hadn't heard from in    months  and he just left a message two days ago. His voice is completely different  but he put his babysitter on the phone  and she was very nice to Randolph as well. But Nico's the best reader I could hope for. I would want anyone I was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things that I create. I feel lucky. Kids like Nico are the best readers  and they deserve the best stories we can give them. Thank you very much. My grandfather was a cobbler. Back in the day  he made custom made shoes. I never got to meet him. He perished in the Holocaust. But I did inherit his love for making  except that it doesn't exist that much anymore. You see  while the Industrial Revolution did a great deal to improve humanity  it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved  and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it. But all of that is about to change with  D printing  and it all started with this  the very first part that was ever printed. It's a little older than TED. It was printed in      by Chuck Hull  who invented  D printing. But the thing that I want to talk to you about today  the big idea that I want to discuss with you  is not that  D printing is going to catapult us into the future  but rather that it's actually going to connect us with our heritage  and it's going to usher in a new era of localized  distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication. So think about useful things. You all know your shoe size. How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples  Anybody  Wouldn't it be awesome if you could  for the first time  get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn't require any hinge assembly  so chances are  the hinges are not going to break  But the implications of  D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. When I met Amanda for the first time  she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down  but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable. It was a beautiful robotic suit made by Ekso Bionics  but it wasn't inspired by her body. It wasn't made to measure. So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine  a little bit more elegant  and lightweight  and like good tailors  we thought that we would measure her digitally. And we did. We built her an amazing suit. The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at  D printing and we say to ourselves  it's going to replace traditional methods. Amanda looked at it and she said  it's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity. And you know what  She's not standing still. She now wants to walk in high heels. It doesn't stop there.  D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them  from new  beautiful  conformal  ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees  another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit here today  you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners  or your dental restorations. Millions of in the ear hearing aids are already  D printed today. Millions of people are served today from these devices. What about full knee replacements  from your data  made to measure  where all of the tools and guides are  D printed  G.E. is using  D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about    percent and cost for an airline of about    million dollars. Good for G.E.  right  And their customers and the environment. But  you know  the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep pocketed corporations. Planetary Resources  a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first  space probe later this year. It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship  it costs a fraction of its cost  and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts  and it's going to be out in space later this year. Google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone  the Ara. It's only possible because of the development of high speed  D printing that for the first time will make functional  usable modules that will go into it. A real moonshot  powered by  D printing. How about food  What if we could  for the first time  make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here  that are edible  What if we could completely change the experience  like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely  D printed  And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste  which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized nutrition around the corner  And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about  D printing. With  D printing  complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape  and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that  D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities  and with that  everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer. That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD  so we're developing haptics  perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay. When you do things like that  and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable  it will make it easier to create content  but with all of the unimagined  we will also have the unintended  like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession. So many people ask me  will we have a  D printer in every home  I think it's the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is  how will  D printing change my life  Or  in other words  what room in my house will  D printing fit in  So everything that you see here has been  D printed  including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show. Now  these are not my grandfather's shoes. These are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper local manufacturing. My grandfather didn't get to see Nike printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl  and my father didn't get to see me standing in my hybridized  D printed shoes. He passed away three years ago. But Chuck Hull  the man that invented it all  is right here in the house today  and thanks to him  I can say  thanks to his invention  I can say that I am a cobbler too  and by standing in these shoes I am honoring my past while manufacturing the future. Thank you. What do you guys think  For those who watched Sir Ken's memorable TED Talk  I am a typical example  of what he describes as  the body as a form of transport for the head   a university professor. You might think it was not fair that I've been lined up to speak after these first two talks to speak about science. I can't move my body to the beat  and after a scientist who became a philosopher  I have to talk about hard science. It could be a very dry subject. Yet  I feel honored. Never in my career  and it's been a long career  have I had the opportunity to start a talk feeling so inspired  like this one. Usually  talking about science is like exercising in a dry place. However  I've had the pleasure of being invited to come here to talk about water. The words  water  and  dry  do not match  right  It is even better to talk about water in the Amazon  which is the splendid cradle  of life. Fresh life. So this is what inspired me. That's why I'm here  although I'm carrying my head over here. I am trying  or will try to convey this inspiration. I hope this story will inspire you and that you'll spread the word. We know that there is controversy. The Amazon is the  lung of the world   because of its massive power to have vital gases exchanged between the forest and the atmosphere. We also hear about the storehouse of biodiversity. While many believe it  few know it. If you go out there  in this marsh  you'll be amazed at the    You can barely see the animals. The Indians say   The forest has more eyes than leaves.  That is true  and I will try to show you something. But today  I'm going to use a different approach  one that is inspired by these two initiatives here  a harmonic one and a philosophical one. I'll try to use an approach that's slightly materialistic  but it also attempts to convey that  in nature  there is extraordinary philosophy and harmony. There'll be no music in my presentation  but I hope you'll all notice the music of the reality I'm going to show you. I'm going to talk about physiology   not about lungs  but other analogies with human physiology  especially the heart. We'll start by thinking that water is like blood. The circulation in our body distributes fresh blood  which feeds  nurtures and supports us  and brings the used blood back to be renewed. In the Amazon  things happen similarly. We'll start by talking about the power of all these processes. This is an image of rain in motion. What you see there is the years passing in seconds. Rains all over the world. What do you see  The equatorial region  in general  and the Amazon specifically  is extremely important for the world's climate. It's a powerful engine. There is a frantic evaporation taking place here. If we take a look at this other image  which shows the water vapor flow  you have dry air in black  moist air in gray  and clouds in white. What you see there is an extraordinary resurgence in the Amazon. What phenomenon    if it's not a desert  what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power  that it can be seen from space  What phenomenon is this  It could be a geyser. A geyser is underground water heated by magma  exploding into the atmosphere and transferring this water  into the atmosphere. There are no geysers in the Amazon  unless I am wrong. I don't know of any. But we have something that plays the same role  with much more elegance though  the trees  our good old friends that  like geysers  can transfer an enormous amount of water from the ground into the atmosphere. There are     billion trees in the Amazon forest      billion geysers. That is done with an extraordinary sophistication. They don't need the heat of magma. They use sunlight to do this process. So  in a typical sunny day in the Amazon  a big tree manages to transfer       liters of water through its transpiration          liters. If we take all the Amazon  which is a very large area  and add it up to all that water that is released by transpiration  which is the sweat of the forest  we'll get to an incredible number     billion metric tons of water. In one day. Do you know how much that is  The Amazon River  the largest river on Earth  one fifth of all the fresh water that leaves the continents of the whole world and ends up in the oceans  dumps    billion metric tons of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean. This river of vapor that comes up from the forest and goes into the atmosphere is greater than the Amazon River. Just to give you an idea. If we could take a gigantic kettle  the kind you could plug into a power socket  an electric one  and put those    billion metric tons of water in it  how much power would you need to have this water evaporated  Any idea  A really big kettle. A gigantic kettle  right     thousand Itaipus. Itaipu is still the largest hydroelectric plant in the world. and Brazil is very proud of it because it provides more  than    percent of the power that is consumed in Brazil. And the Amazon is here  doing this for free. It's a vivid and extremely powerful plant  providing environmental services. Related to this subject  we are going to talk about what I call the paradox of chance  which is curious. If you look at the world map    it's easy to see this    you'll see that there are forests in the equatorial zone  and deserts are organized at    degrees north latitude     degrees south latitude  aligned. Look over there  in the southern hemisphere  the Atacama  Namibia and Kalahari in Africa  the Australian desert. In the northern hemisphere  the Sahara  Sonoran  etc. There is an exception  and it's curious  It's the quadrangle that ranges from Cuiab  to Buenos Aires  and from S o Paulo to the Andes. This quadrangle was supposed to be a desert. It's on the line of deserts. Why isn't it  That's why I call it the paradox of chance. What do we have in South America that is different  If we could use the analogy of the blood circulating in our bodies  like the water circulating in the landscape  we see that rivers are veins  they drain the landscape  they drain the tissue of nature. Where are the arteries  Any guess  What takes    How does water get to irrigate the tissues of nature and bring everything back through rivers  There is a new type of river  which originates in the blue sea  which flows through the green ocean    it not only flows  but it is also pumped by the green ocean    and then it falls on our land. All our economy  that quadrangle     percent of South America's  GDP comes from that area. It depends on this river. This river flows invisibly above us. We are floating here on this floating hotel  on one of the largest rivers on Earth  the Negro River. It's a bit dry and rough  but we are floating here  and there is this invisible river running above us. This river has a pulse. Here it is  pulsing. That's why we also talk about the heart. You can see the different seasons there. There's the rainy season. In the Amazon  we used to have two seasons  the humid season and the even more humid season. Now we have a dry season. You can see the river covering that region which  otherwise  would be a desert. And it is not. We  scientists    You see that I'm struggling here to move my head from one side to the other. Scientists study how it works  why  etc. and these studies are generating a series of discoveries  which are absolutely fabulous  to raise our awareness of the wealth  the complexity  and the wonder that we have  the symphony we have in this process. One of them is  How is rain formed  Above the Amazon  there is clean air  as there is clean air above the ocean. The blue sea has clean air above it and forms pretty few clouds  there's almost no rain there. The green ocean has the same clean air  but forms a lot of rain. What is happening here that is different  The forest emits smells  and these smells are condensation nuclei  which form drops in the atmosphere. Then  clouds are formed and there is torrential rain. The sprinkler of the Garden of Eden. This relation between a living thing  which is the forest  and a nonliving thing  which is the atmosphere  is ingenious in the Amazon  because the forest provides water and seeds  and the atmosphere forms the rain and gives water back  guaranteeing the forest's survival. There are other factors as well. We've talked a little about the heart  and let's now talk about another function  the liver  When humid air  high humidity and radiation are combined with these organic compounds  which I call exogenous vitamin C  generous vitamin C in the form of gas  the plants release antioxidants which react with pollutants. You can rest assured that you are breathing the purest air on Earth  here in the Amazon  because the plants take care of this characteristic as well. This benefits the very way plants work  which is another ingenious cycle. Speaking of fractals  and their relation with the way we work  we can establish other comparisons. As in the upper airways of our lungs  the air in the Amazon gets cleaned up from the excess of dust. The dust in the air that we breathe is cleaned by our airways. This keeps the excess of dust from affecting the rainfall. When there are fires in the Amazon  the smoke stops the rain   it stops raining  the forest dries up and catches fire. There is another fractal analogy. Like in the veins and arteries  the rain water is a feedback. It returns to the atmosphere. Like endocrinal glands and hormones  there are those gases which I told you about before  that are formed and released into the atmosphere  like hormones  which help in the formation of rain. Like the liver and the kidneys  as I've said  cleaning the air. And  finally  like the heart  pumping water from outside  from the sea  into the forest. We call it the biotic moisture pump  a new theory that is explained in a very simple way. If there is a desert in the continent with a nearby sea  evaporation's greater on the sea  and it sucks the air above the desert. The desert is trapped in this condition. It will always be dry. If you have the opposite situation  a forest  the evaporation  as we showed  is much greater  because of the trees  and this relation is reversed. The air above the sea is sucked into the continent and humidity is imported. This satellite image was taken one month ago   that's Manaus down there  we're down there   and it shows this process. It's not a common little river that flows into a canal. It's a mighty river that irrigates South America  among other things. This image shows those paths  all the hurricanes that have been recorded. You can see that  in the red square  there hardly are any hurricanes. That is no accident. This pump that sucks the moisture into the continent also speeds up the air above the sea  and this prevents hurricane formations. To close this part and sum up  I'd like to talk about something a little different. I have several colleagues who worked in the development of these theories. They think  and so do I  that we can save planet Earth. I'm not talking only about the Amazon. The Amazon teaches us a lesson on how pristine nature works. We didn't understand these processes before because the rest of the world is messed up. We could understand it here  though. These colleagues propose that  yes  we can save other areas  including deserts. If we could establish forests in those other areas  we can reverse climate change  including global warming. I have a dear colleague in India  whose name is Suprabha Seshan  and she has a motto. Her motto is   Gardening back the biosphere    Reajardinando a biosfera  in Portuguese. She does a wonderful job rebuilding ecosystems. We need to do this. Having closed this quick introduction  we see the reality that we have out here  which is drought  this climate change  things that we already knew. I'd like to tell you a short story. Once  about four years ago  I attended a declamation  of a text by Davi Kopenawa  a wise representative of the Yanomami people  and it went more or less like this   Doesn't the white man know that  if he destroys the forest  there will be no more rain  And that  if there's no more rain  there'll be nothing to drink  or to eat   I heard that  and my eyes welled up and I went   Oh  my  I've been studying this for    years  with a super computer  dozens  thousands of scientists  and we are starting to get to this conclusion  which he already knows   A critical point is the Yanomami have never deforested. How could they know the rain would end  This bugged me and I was befuddled. How could he know that  Some months later  I met him at another event and said   Davi  how did you know that if the forest was destroyed  there'd be no more rain   He replied   The spirit of the forest told us.  For me  this was a game changer  a radical change. I said   Gosh  Why am I doing all this science to get to a conclusion that he already knows   Then  something  absolutely critical hit me  which is  seeing is believing. Out of sight  out of mind. This is a need the previous speaker pointed out  We need to see things    I mean  we  Western society  which is becoming global  civilized    we need to see. If we don't see  we don't register the information. We live in ignorance. So  I propose the following    of course  the astronomer wouldn't like the idea    but let's turn the Hubble telescope upside down. And let's make it look down here  rather than to the far reaches of the universe. The universe is wonderful  but we have a practical reality  which is we live in an unknown cosmos  and we're ignorant about it. We're trampling on this wonderful cosmos that shelters us and houses us. Talk to any astrophysicist. The Earth is a statistical improbability. The stability and comfort that we enjoy  despite the droughts of the Negro River  and all the heat and cold and typhoons  etc.  there is nothing like it in the universe  that we know of. Then  let's turn Hubble in our direction  and let's look at the Earth. Let's start with the Amazon  Let's dive  let's reach out the reality we live in every day  and look carefully at it  since that's what we need. Davi Kopenawa doesn't need this. He has something already that I think I missed. I was educated by television. I think that I missed this  an ancestral record  a valuation of what I don't know  what I haven't seen. He is not a doubting Thomas. He believes   with veneration and reverence  in what his ancestors and the spirits taught him. We can't do it  so let's look into the forest. Even with Hubble up there    this is a bird's eye view  right  Even when this happens  we also see something that we don't know. The Spanish called it the green inferno. If you go out there into the bushes and get lost  and  let's say  if you head west  it's     kilometers to Colombia  and another       to somewhere else. So  you can figure out why they called it the green inferno. But go and look at what is in there. It is a live carpet. Each color you see is a tree species. Each tree  each tree top  has up to        species of insects in it  let alone the millions of species of fungi  bacteria  etc. All invisible. All of it is an even stranger cosmos to us than the galaxies billions of light years away from the Earth  which Hubble brings to our newspapers everyday. I'm going to end my talk here    I have a few seconds left    by showing you this wonderful being. When we see the morpho butterfly in the forest  we feel like someone's left open the door to heaven  and this creature escaped from there  because it's so beautiful. However  I cannot finish without showing you a tech side. We are tech arrogant. We deprive nature of its technology. A robotic hand is technological  mine is biological  and we don't think about it anymore. Let's then look at the morpho butterfly  an example of an invisible technological competence of life  which is at the very heart of our possibility of surviving on this planet  and let's zoom in on it. Again  Hubble is there. Let's get into the butterfly's wings. Scholars have tried to explain  Why is it blue  Let's zoom in on it. What you see is that the architecture of the invisible humiliates the best architects in the world. All of this on a tiny scale. Besides its beauty and functioning  there is another side to it. In nature  all that is organized in extraordinary structures has a function. This function of the morpho butterfly   it is not blue  it does not have blue pigments. It has photonic crystals on its surface  according to people who studied it  which are extremely  sophisticated crystals. Our technology had nothing like that at the time. Hitachi has now made a monitor that uses this technology  and it is used in optical fibers to transmit    Janine Benyus  who's been here several times  talks about it  biomimetics. My time's up. Then  I'll wrap it up with what is at the base of this capacity  of this competence of biodiversity  producing all these wonderful services  the living cell. It is a structure with a few microns  which is an internal wonder. There are TED Talks about it. I won't talk much longer  but each person in this room  including myself  has     trillion of these micromachines in their body  so that we can enjoy well being. Imagine what is out there in the Amazon forest      trillion. This is greater than the number of stars in the sky. And we are not aware of it. Thank you so much.  Applause  We are at a remarkable moment in time. We face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations that will determine whether the next     years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries. Let me illustrate with an example. I first visited Beijing    years ago to teach at the People's University of China. China was getting serious about market economics and about university education  so they decided to call in the foreign experts. Like most other people  I moved around Beijing by bicycle. Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle  it was a safe and easy way to get around. Cycling in Beijing now is a completely different prospect. The roads are jammed by cars and trucks. The air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal and diesel. When I was there last in the spring  there was an advisory for people of my age   over      to stay indoors and not move much. How did this come about  It came from the way in which Beijing has grown as a city. It's doubled over those    years  more than doubled  from    million to    million. It's become a sprawling urban area dependent on dirty fuel  dirty energy  particularly coal. China burns half the world's coal each year  and that's why  it is a key reason why  it is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. At the same time  we have to recognize that in that period China has grown remarkably. It has become the world's second largest economy. Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. That's really important. But at the same time  the people of China are asking the question  What's the value of this growth if our cities are unlivable  They've analyzed  diagnosed that this is an unsustainable path of growth and development. China's planning to scale back coal. It's looking to build its cities in different ways. Now  the growth of China is part of a dramatic change  fundamental change  in the structure of the world economy. Just    years ago  the developing countries  the poorer countries of the world  were  notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people  they accounted for only about a third of the world's output. Now it's more than half     years from now  it will probably be two thirds from the countries that we saw    years ago as developing. That's a remarkable change. It means that most countries around the world  rich or poor  are going to be facing the two fundamental transformations that I want to talk about and highlight. Now  the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that I've already begun to illustrate through the description of Beijing. Fifty percent now in urban areas. That's going to go to    percent in     . Over the next two decades  we'll see the demand for energy rise by    percent  and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land  on our water and on our forests. This is profound structural change. If we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way  we will create waste  pollution  congestion  destruction of land and forests. If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated with my numbers   cities  energy  land   if we manage all that badly  then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods of the people around the world would be poor and damaged. And more than that  the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise  with immense risks to our climate. Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already higher than they've been for millions of years. If we go on increasing those concentrations  we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years. We've been around as Homo sapiens   that's a rather generous definition  sapiens   for perhaps a quarter of a million years  a quarter of a million. We risk temperatures we haven't seen for tens of millions of years over a century. That would transform the relationship between human beings and the planet. It would lead to changing deserts  changing rivers  changing patterns of hurricanes  changing sea levels  hundreds of millions of people  perhaps billions of people who would have to move  and if we've learned anything from history  that means severe and extended conflict. And we couldn't just turn it off. You can't make a peace treaty with the planet. You can't negotiate with the laws of physics. You're in there. You're stuck. Those are the stakes we're playing for  and that's why we have to make this second transformation  the climate transformation  and move to a low carbon economy. Now  the first of these transformations is going to happen anyway. We have to decide whether to do it well or badly  the economic  or structural  transformation. But the second of the transformations  the climate transformations  we have to decide to do. Those two transformations face us in the next two decades. The next two decades are decisive for what we have to do. Now  the more I've thought about this  the two transformations coming together  the more I've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity. It's an opportunity which we can use or it's an opportunity which we can lose. And let me explain through those three key areas that I've identified  cities  energy and land. And let me start with cities. I've already described the problems of Beijing  pollution  congestion  waste and so on. Surely we recognize that in many of our cities around the world. Now  with cities  like life but particularly cities  you have to think ahead. The cities that are going to be built   and there are many  and many big ones   we have to think of how to design them in a compact way so we can save travel time  and we can save energy. The cities that already are  there  well established  we have to think about renewal and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better within those cities  and make it easier  encourage more people  to live closer to the center. We've got examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that. The bus rapid transport system in Bogot  in Colombia is a very important case of how to move around safely and quickly in a non polluting way in a city  very frequent buses  strongly protected routes  the same service  really  as an underground railway system  but much  much cheaper and can be done much more quickly  a brilliant idea in many more cities around the world that's developing. Now  some things in cities do take time. Some things in cities can happen much more quickly. Take my hometown  London. In       smog in London killed       people and badly damaged the lives of many  many more. And it happened all the time. For those of you live outside London in the U.K. will remember it used to be called The Smoke. That's the way London was. By regulating coal  within a few years the problems of smog were rapidly reduced. I remember the smogs well. When the visibility dropped to  less  than a few meters  they stopped the buses and I had to walk. This was the     s. I had to walk home three miles from school. Again  breathing was a hazardous activity. But it was changed. It was changed by a decision. Good decisions can bring good results  striking results  quickly. We've seen more  In London  we've introduced the congestion charge  actually quite quickly and effectively  and we've seen great improvements in the bus system  and cleaned up the bus system. You can see that the two transformations I've described  the structural and the climate  come very much together. But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities  and we have to invest wisely  and if we do  we'll see cleaner cities  quieter cities  safer cities  more attractive cities  more productive cities  and stronger community in those cities   public transport  recycling  reusing  all sorts of things that bring communities together. We can do that  but we have to think  we have to invest  we have to plan. Let me turn to energy. Now  energy over the last    years has increased by about    percent. Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels. Over the next    years  perhaps it will increase by another    percent or so. We have to invest strongly in energy  we have to use it much more efficiently  and we have to make it clean. We can see how to do that. Take the example of California. It would be in the top    countries in the world if it was independent. I don't want to start any   California's a big place. In the next five or six years  they will likely move from around    percent in renewables   wind  solar and so on   to over    percent  and that would bring California back to greenhouse gas emissions in      to where they were in       a period when the economy in California would more or less have doubled. That's a striking achievement. It shows what can be done. Not just California   the  incoming government of India is planning to get solar technology to light up the homes of     million people who don't have electricity in India. They've set themselves a target of five years. I think they've got a good chance of doing that. We'll see  but what you're seeing now is people moving much more quickly. Four hundred million  more than the population of the United States. Those are the kinds of ambitions now people are setting themselves in terms of rapidity of change. Again  you can see good decisions can bring quick results  and those two transformations  the economy and the structure and the climate and the low carbon  are intimately intertwined. Do the first one well  the structural  the second one on the climate becomes much easier. Look at land  land and particularly forests. Forests are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species. They hold water in the soil and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere  fundamental to the tackling of climate change. But we're losing our forests. In the last decade  we've lost a forest area the size of Portugal  and much more has been degraded. But we're already seeing that we can do so much about that. We can recognize the problem  but we can also understand how to tackle it. In Brazil  the rate of deforestation has been reduced by    percent over the last    years. How  By involving local communities  investing in their agriculture and their economies  by monitoring more carefully  by enforcing the law more strictly. And it's not just stopping deforestation. That's of course of first and fundamental importance  but it's also regrading degraded land  regenerating  rehabilitating degraded land. I first went to Ethiopia in     . It was desperately poor. In the following years  it suffered devastating famines and profoundly destructive social conflict. Over the last few years  actually more than a few  Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly. It has ambitions to be a middle income country    years from now and to be carbon neutral. Again  I think it's a strong ambition but it is a plausible one. You're seeing that commitment there. You're seeing what can be done. Ethiopia is investing in clean energy. It's working in the rehabilitation of land. In Humbo  in southwest Ethiopia  a wonderful project to plant trees on degraded land and work with local communities on sustainable forest management has led to big increases in living standards. So we can see  from Beijing to London  from California to India  from Brazil to Ethiopia  we do understand how to manage those two transformations  the structural and the climate. We do understand how to manage those well. And technology is changing very rapidly. I don't have to list all those things to an audience like this  but you can see the electric cars  you can see the batteries using new materials. You can see that we can manage remotely now our household appliances on our mobile phones when we're away. You can see better insulation. And there's much more coming. But  and it's a big but  the world as a whole is moving far too slowly. We're not cutting emissions in the way we should. We're not managing those structural transformations as we can. The depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change are not there yet. The depth of understanding of the attractiveness of what we can do is not there yet. We need political pressure to build. We need leaders to step up. We can have better growth  better climate  a better world. We can make  by managing those two transformations well  the next     years the best of centuries. If we make a mess of it  we  you and me  if we make a mess of it  if we don't manage those transformations properly  it will be  the next     years will be the worst of centuries. That's the major conclusion of the report on the economy and climate chaired by ex President Felipe Calder n of Mexico  and I co chaired that with him  and we handed that report yesterday here in New York  in the United Nations Building to the Secretary General of the U.N.  Ban Ki moon. We know that we can do this. Now  two weeks ago  I became a grandfather for the fourth time. Our daughter   Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York two weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa. Two weeks old. Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we understood the issues  that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities  and still we failed to act  Surely not. Let's make the next     years the best of centuries. America's favorite pie is  Audience  Apple. Kenneth Cukier  Apple. Of course it is. How do we know it  Because of data. You look at supermarket sales. You look at supermarket sales of    centimeter pies that are frozen  and apple wins  no contest. The majority of the sales are apple. But then supermarkets started selling smaller     centimeter pies  and suddenly  apple fell to fourth or fifth place. Why  What happened  Okay  think about it. When you buy a    centimeter pie  the whole family has to agree  and apple is everyone's second favorite. But when you buy an individual    centimeter pie  you can buy the one that you want. You can get your first choice. You have more data. You can see something that you couldn't see when you only had smaller amounts of it. Now  the point here is that more data doesn't just let us see more  more of the same thing we were looking at. More data allows us to see new. It allows us to see better. It allows us to see different. In this case  it allows us to see what America's favorite pie is  not apple. Now  you probably all have heard the term big data. In fact  you're probably sick of hearing the term big data. It is true that there is a lot of hype around the term  and that is very unfortunate  because big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance. In the past  we used to look at small data and think about what it would mean to try to understand the world  and now we have a lot more of it  more than we ever could before. What we find is that when we have a large body of data  we can fundamentally do things that we couldn't do when we only had smaller amounts. Big data is important  and big data is new  and when you think about it  the only way this planet is going to deal with its global challenges   to feed people  supply them with medical care  supply them with energy  electricity  and to make sure they're not burnt to a crisp because of global warming   is because of the effective use of data. So what is new about big  data  What is the big deal  Well  to answer that question  let's think about what information looked like  physically looked like in the past. In       on the island of Crete  archaeologists discovered a clay disc. They dated it from      B.C.  so it's       years old. Now  there's inscriptions on this disc  but we actually don't know what it means. It's a complete mystery  but the point is that this is what information used to look like       years ago. This is how society stored and transmitted information. Now  society hasn't advanced all that much. We still store information on discs  but now we can store a lot more information  more than ever before. Searching it is easier. Copying it easier. Sharing it is easier. Processing it is easier. And what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined when we first collected the data. In this respect  the data has gone from a stock to a flow  from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic. There is  if you will  a liquidity to information. The disc that was discovered off of Crete that's       years old  is heavy  it doesn't store a lot of information  and that information is unchangeable. By contrast  all of the files that Edward Snowden took from the National Security Agency in the United States fits on a memory stick the size of a fingernail  and it can be shared at the speed of light. More data. More. Now  one reason why we have so much data in the world today is we are collecting things that we've always collected information on  but another reason why is we're taking things that have always been informational but have never been rendered into a data format and we are putting it into data. Think  for example  the question of location. Take  for example  Martin Luther. If we wanted to know in the     s where Martin Luther was  we would have to follow him at all times  maybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell  and record it  but now think about what it looks like today. You know that somewhere  probably in a telecommunications carrier's database  there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry that records your information of where you've been at all times. If you have a cell phone  and that cell phone has GPS  but even if it doesn't have GPS  it can record your information. In this respect  location has been datafied. Now think  for example  of the issue of posture  the way that you are all sitting right now  the way that you sit  the way that you sit  the way that you sit. It's all different  and it's a function of your leg length and your back and the contours of your back  and if I were to put sensors   maybe     sensors into all of your chairs right now  I could create an index that's fairly unique to you  sort of like a fingerprint  but it's not your finger. So what could we do with this  Researchers in Tokyo are using it as a potential anti theft device in cars. The idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel  tries to stream off  but the car recognizes that a non approved driver is behind the wheel  and maybe the engine just stops  unless you type in a password into the dashboard to say   Hey  I have authorization to drive.  Great. What if every single car in Europe had this technology in it  What could we do then  Maybe  if we aggregated the data  maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict that a car accident is going to take place in the next five seconds. And then what we will have datafied is driver fatigue  and the service would be when the car senses that the person slumps into that position  automatically knows  hey  set an internal alarm that would vibrate the steering wheel  honk inside to say   Hey  wake up  pay more attention to the road.  These are the sorts of things we can do when we datafy more aspects of our lives. So what is the value of big data  Well  think about it. You have more information. You can do things that you couldn't do before. One of the most impressive areas where this concept is taking place is in the area of machine learning. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence  which itself is a branch of computer science. The general idea is that instead of instructing a computer what do do  we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself. And it will help you understand it by seeing its origins. In the     s  a computer scientist at IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers  so he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer. He played. He won. He played. He won. He played. He won  because the computer only knew what a legal move was. Arthur Samuel knew something else. Arthur Samuel knew strategy. So he wrote a small sub program alongside it operating in the background  and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every move. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer to play itself. It plays itself. It collects more data. It collects more data. It increases the accuracy of its prediction. And then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer and he plays it  and he loses  and he plays it  and he loses  and he plays it  and he loses  and Arthur Samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it. And this idea of machine learning is going everywhere. How do you think we have self driving cars  Are we any better off as a society enshrining all the rules of the road into software  No. Memory is cheaper. No. Algorithms are faster. No. Processors are better. No. All of those things matter  but that's not why. It's because we changed the nature of the problem. We changed the nature of the problem from one in which we tried to overtly and explicitly explain to the computer how to drive to one in which we say   Here's a lot of data around the vehicle. You figure it out. You figure it out that that is a traffic light  that that traffic light is red and not green  that that means that you need to stop and not go forward.  Machine learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do online  search engines  Amazon's personalization algorithm  computer translation  voice recognition systems. Researchers recently have looked at the question of biopsies  cancerous biopsies  and they've asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine whether cells are actually cancerous or not  and sure enough  when you throw the data at it  through a machine learning algorithm  the machine was able to identify the    telltale signs that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous. The problem  The medical literature only knew nine of them. Three of the traits were ones that people didn't need to look for  but that the machine spotted. Now  there are dark sides to big data as well. It will improve our lives  but there are problems that we need to be conscious of  and the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions  that the police may use big data for their purposes  a little bit like  Minority Report.  Now  it's a term called predictive policing  or algorithmic criminology  and the idea is that if we take a lot of data  for example where past crimes have been  we know where to send the patrols. That makes sense  but the problem  of course  is that it's not simply going to stop on location data  it's going to go down to the level of the individual. Why don't we use data about the person's high school transcript  Maybe we should use the fact that they're unemployed or not  their credit score  their web surfing behavior  whether they're up late at night. Their Fitbit  when it's able to identify biochemistries  will show that they have aggressive thoughts. We may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do  and we may be held accountable before we've actually acted. Privacy was the central challenge in a small data era. In the big data age  the challenge will be safeguarding free will  moral choice  human volition  human agency. There is another problem  Big data is going to steal our jobs. Big data and algorithms are going to challenge white collar  professional knowledge work in the   st century in the same way that factory automation and the assembly line challenged blue collar labor in the   th century. Think about a lab technician who is looking through a microscope at a cancer biopsy and determining whether it's cancerous or not. The person went to university. The person buys property. He or she votes. He or she is a stakeholder in society. And that person's job  as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person  is going to find that their jobs are radically changed or actually completely eliminated. Now  we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short  temporary period of dislocation  and that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live  the Industrial Revolution  because that's precisely what happened. But we forget something in that analysis  There are some categories of jobs that simply get eliminated and never come back. The Industrial Revolution wasn't very good if you were a horse. So we're going to need to be careful and take big data and adjust it for our needs  our very human needs. We have to be the master of this technology  not its servant. We are just at the outset of the big data era  and honestly  we are not very good at handling all the data that we can now collect. It's not just a problem for the National Security Agency. Businesses collect lots of data  and they misuse it too  and we need to get better at this  and this will take time. It's a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire. This is a tool  but this is a tool that  unless we're careful  will burn us. Big data is going to transform how we live  how we work and how we think. It is going to help us manage our careers and lead lives of satisfaction and hope and happiness and health  but in the past  we've often looked at information technology and our eyes have only seen the T  the technology  the hardware  because that's what was physical. We now need to recast our gaze at the I  the information  which is less apparent  but in some ways a lot more important. Humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect  as part of our timeless quest to understand the world and our place in it  and that's why big data is a big deal. When I turned     I started my career as the first female photojournalist in the Gaza Strip  Palestine. My work as a woman photographer was considered a serious insult to local traditions  and created a lasting stigma for me and my family. The male dominated field made my presence unwelcome by all possible means. They made clear that a woman must not do a man's job. Photo agencies in Gaza refused to train me because of my gender. The  No  sign was pretty clear. Three of my colleagues went as far as to drive me to an open air strike area where the explosion sounds were the only thing I could hear. Dust was flying in the air  and the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me. I only realized we weren't there to document the event when the three of them got back into the armored Jeep and drove away  waving and laughing  leaving me behind in the open air strike zone. For a moment  I felt terrified  humiliated  and sorry for myself. My colleagues' action was not the only death threat I have received  but it was the most dangerous one. The perception of women's life in Gaza is passive. Until a recent time  a lot of  women were not allowed to work or pursue education. At times of such doubled war including both social restrictions on women and the Israeli Palestinian conflict  women's dark and bright stories were fading away. To men  women's stories were seen as inconsequential. I started paying closer attention to women's lives in Gaza. Because of my gender  I had access to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden. Beyond the obvious pain and struggle  there was a healthy dose of laughter and accomplishments. In front of a police compound in Gaza City during the first war in Gaza  an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound and break my nose. For a moment  all I saw was white  bright white  like these lights. I thought to myself I either got blind or I was in heaven. By the time I managed to open my eyes  I had documented this moment. Mohammed Khader  a Palestinian worker who spent two decades in Israel  as his retirement plan  he decided to build a four floor house  only by the first field operation at his neighborhood  the house was flattened to the ground. Nothing was left but the pigeons he raised and a jacuzzi  a bathtub that he got from Tel Aviv. Mohammed got the bathtub on the top of the rubble and started giving his kids an every morning bubble bath. My work is not meant to hide the scars of war  but to show the full frame of unseen stories of Gazans. As a Palestinian female photographer  the journey of struggle  survival and everyday life has inspired me to overcome the community taboo and see a different side of war and its aftermath. I became a witness with a choice  to run away or stand still. Thank you. I've been a critical care EMT for the past seven years in Suffolk County  New York. I've been a first responder in a number of incidents ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy. If you are like most people  death might be one of your greatest fears. Some of us will see it coming. Some of us won't. There is a little known documented medical term called impending doom. It's almost a symptom. As a medical provider  I'm trained to respond to this symptom like any other  so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me and says   I'm going to die today   we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition. Throughout my career  I have responded to a number of incidents where the patient had minutes left to live and there was nothing I could do for them. With this  I was faced with a dilemma  Do I tell the dying that they are about to face death  or do I lie to them to comfort them  Early in my career  I faced this dilemma by simply lying. I was afraid. I was afraid if I told them the truth  that they would die in terror  in fear  just grasping for those last moments of life. That all changed with one incident. Five years ago  I responded to a motorcycle accident. The rider had suffered critical  critical injuries. As I assessed him  I realized that there was nothing that could be done for him  and like so many other cases  he looked me in the eye and asked that question   Am I going to die   In that moment  I decided to do something different. I decided to tell him the truth. I decided to tell him that he was going to die and that there was nothing I could do for him. His reaction shocked me to this day. He simply laid back and had a look of acceptance on his face. He was not met with that terror or fear that I thought he would be. He simply laid there  and as I looked into his eyes  I saw inner peace and acceptance. From that moment forward  I decided it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies. Having responded to many cases since then where patients were in their last moments and there was nothing I could do for them  in almost every case  they have all had the same reaction to the truth  of inner peace and acceptance. In fact  there are three patterns I have observed in all these cases. The first pattern always kind of shocked me. Regardless of religious belief or cultural background  there's a need for forgiveness. Whether they call it sin or they simply say they have a regret  their guilt is universal. I had once cared for an elderly gentleman who was having a massive heart attack. As I prepared myself and my equipment for his imminent cardiac arrest  I began to tell the patient of his imminent demise. He already knew by my tone of voice and body language. As I placed the defibrillator pads on his chest  prepping for what was going to happen  he looked me in the eye and said   I wish I had spent more time with my children and grandchildren instead of being selfish with my time.  Faced with imminent death  all he wanted was forgiveness. The second pattern I observe is the need for remembrance. Whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts or their loved ones'  they needed to feel that they would be living on. There's a need for immortality within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones  myself  my crew  or anyone around. Countless times  I have had a  patient look me in the eyes and say   Will you remember me   The final pattern I observe always touched me the deepest  to the soul. The dying need to know that their life had meaning. They need to know that they did not waste their life on meaningless tasks. This came to me very  very early in my career. I had responded to a call. There was a female in her late   s severely pinned within a vehicle. She had been t boned at a high rate of speed  critical  critical condition. As the fire department worked to remove her from the car  I climbed in to begin to render care. As we talked  she had said to me   There was so much more I wanted to do with my life.  She had felt she had not left her mark on this Earth. As we talked further  it would turn out that she was a mother of two adopted children who were both on their way to medical school. Because of her  two children had a chance they never would have had otherwise and would go on to save lives in the medical field as medical doctors. It would end up taking    minutes to free her from the vehicle. However  she perished prior to freeing her. I believed what you saw in the movies  when you're in those last moments that it's strictly terror  fear. I have come to realize  regardless of the circumstance  it's generally met with peace and acceptance  that it's the littlest things  the littlest moments  the littlest things you brought into the world that give you peace in those final moments. Thank you. When  in       still a student  I got a traveling fellowship to study housing in North America. We traveled the country. We saw public housing high rise buildings in all major cities  New York  Philadelphia. Those who have no choice lived there. And then we traveled from suburb to suburb  and I came back thinking  we've got to reinvent the apartment building. There has to be another way of doing this. We can't sustain suburbs  so let's design a building which gives the qualities of a house to each unit. Habitat would be all about gardens  contact with nature  streets instead of corridors. We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy  and there it is almost    years later. It's a very desirable place to live in. It's now a heritage building  but it did not proliferate. In       I made my first trip to China. It was the Cultural Revolution. We traveled the country  met with architects and planners. This is Beijing then  not a single high rise building in Beijing or Shanghai. Shenzhen didn't even exist as a city. There were hardly any cars. Thirty years later  this is Beijing today. This is Hong Kong. If you're wealthy  you live there  if you're poor  you live there  but high density it is  and it's not just Asia. S o Paulo  you can travel in a helicopter    minutes seeing those high rise buildings consume the   th century low rise environment. And with it  comes congestion  and we lose mobility  and so on and so forth. So a few years ago  we decided to go back and rethink Habitat. Could we make it more affordable  Could we actually achieve this quality of life in the densities that are prevailing today  And we realized  it's basically about light  it's about sun  it's about nature  it's about fractalization. Can we open up the surface of the building so that it has more contact with the exterior  We came up with a number of models  economy models  cheaper to build and more compact  membranes of housing where people could design their own house and create their own gardens. And then we decided to take New York as a test case  and we looked at Lower Manhattan. And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan. On the left is Manhattan today  blue for housing  red for office buildings  retail. On the right  we reconfigured it  the office buildings form the base  and then rising    stories above  are apartments. There's a street in the air on the   th level  a community street. It's permeable. There are gardens and open spaces for the community  almost every unit with its own private garden  and community space all around. And most important  permeable  open. It does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city  and light permeates everywhere. And in the last two or three years  we've actually been  for the first time  realizing the quality of life of Habitat in real life projects across Asia. This in Qinhuangdao in China  middle income housing  where there is a bylaw that every apartment must receive three hours of sunlight. That's measured in the winter solstice. And under construction in Singapore  again middle income housing  gardens  community streets and parks and so on and so forth. And Colombo. And I want to touch on one more issue  which is the design of the public realm. A hundred years after we've begun building with tall buildings  we are yet to understand how the tall high rise building becomes a building block in making a city  in creating the public realm. In Singapore  we had an opportunity     million square feet  extremely high density. Taking the concept of outdoor and indoor  promenades and parks integrated with intense urban life. So they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces  and you move from one to the other  and there is contact with nature  and most relevantly  at every level of the structure  public gardens and open space  on the roof of the podium  climbing up the towers  and finally on the roof  the sky park  two and a half acres  jogging paths  restaurants  and the world's longest swimming pool. And that's all I can tell you in five minutes. Thank you. I am an engineering professor  and for the past    years I've been teaching crap. Not that I'm a bad teacher  but I've been studying and teaching about human waste and how waste is conveyed through these wastewater treatment plants  and how we engineer and design these treatment plants so that we can protect surface water like rivers. I've based my scientific career on using leading edge molecular techniques  DNA  and RNA based methods to look at microbial populations in biological reactors  and again to optimize these systems. And over the years  I have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets  and I've been known to sneak into toilets and take my camera phone all over the world. But along the way  I've learned that it's not just the technical side  but there's also this thing called the culture of crap. So for example  how many of you are washers and how many of you are wipers  If  well  I guess you know what I mean. If you're a washer  then you use water for anal cleansing. That's the technical term. And if you're a wiper  then you use toilet paper or  in some regions of the world where it's not available  newspaper or rags or corncobs. And this is not just a piece of trivia  but it's really important to understand and solve the sanitation problem. And it is a big problem  There are  .  billion people in the world who don't have access to adequate sanitation. For them  there's no modern toilet. And there are  .  billion people whose toilets are the streets or river banks or open spaces  and again  the technical term for that is open defecation  but that is really simply shitting in the open. And if you're living in fecal material and it's surrounding you  you're going to get sick. It's going to get into your drinking water  into your food  into your immediate surroundings. So the United Nations estimates that every year  there are   .  million child deaths because of inadequate sanitation. That's one preventable death every    seconds      every hour        every day. And so  to avoid open defecation  municipalities and cities build infrastructure  for example  like pit latrines  in peri urban and rural areas. For example  in KwaZulu Natal  province in South Africa  they've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines. But there's a problem when you scale up to tens of thousands  and the problem is  what happens when the pits are full  This is what happens. People defecate around the toilet. In schools  children defecate on the floors and then leave a trail outside the building and start defecating around the building  and these pits have to be cleaned and manually emptied. And who does the emptying  You've got these workers who have to sometimes go down into the pits and manually remove the contents. It's a dirty and dangerous business. As you can see  there's no protective equipment  no protective clothing. There's one worker down there. I hope you can see him. He's got a face mask on  but no shirt. And in some countries  like India  the lower castes are condemned to empty the pits  and they're further condemned by society. So you ask yourself  how can we solve this and why don't we just build Western style flush toilets for these two and a half billion  And the answer is  it's just not possible. In some of these areas  there's not enough water  there's no energy  it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars to lay out the sewer lines and to build the facilities and to operate and maintain these systems  and if you don't build it right  you're going to have flush toilets that basically go straight into the river  just like what's happening in many cities in the developing world. And is this really the solution  Because essentially  what you're doing is you're using clean water and you're using it to flush your toilet  convey it to a wastewater treatment plant which then discharges to a river  and that river  again  is a drinking water source. So we've got to rethink sanitation  and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure  and I'm going to argue that to do this  you have to employ systems thinking. We have to look at the whole sanitation chain. We start with a human interface  and then we have to think about how feces are collected and stored  transported  treated and reused   and not just disposal but reuse. So let's start with the human user interface. I say  it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper  a sitter or a squatter  the human user interface should be clean and easy to use  because after all  taking a dump should be pleasurable. And when we open the possibilities to understanding this sanitation chain  then the back end technology  the collection to the reuse  should not really matter  and then we can apply locally adoptable and context sensitive solutions. So we can open ourselves to possibilities like  for example  this urine diverting toilet  and there's two holes in this toilet. There's the front and the back  and the front collects the urine  and the back collects the fecal material. And so what you're doing is you're separating the urine  which has    percent of the nitrogen and    percent of the phosphorus  and then that can then be treated and precipitated to form things like struvite  which is a high value fertilizer  and then the fecal material can then be disinfected and again converted to high value end products. Or  for example  in some of our research  you can reuse the water by treating it in on site sanitation systems like planter boxes or constructed wetlands. So we can open up all these possibilities if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets and treatment plants. So you might be asking  who's going to pay  Well  I'm going to argue that governments should fund sanitation infrastructure. NGOs and donor organizations  they can do their best  but it's not going to be enough. Governments should fund sanitation the same way they fund roads and schools and hospitals and other infrastructure like bridges  because we know  and the WHO has done this study  that for every dollar that we invest in sanitation infrastructure  we get something like three to    dollars back. Let's go back to the problem of pit emptying. So at North Carolina State University  we challenged our students to come up with a simple solution  and this is what they came up with  a simple  modified screw auger that can move the waste up from the pit and into a collecting drum  and now the pit worker doesn't have to go down into the pit. We tested it in South Africa  and it works. We need to make it more robust  and we're going to do more testing in Malawi and South Africa this coming year. And our idea is to make this a professionalized pit emptying service so that we can create a small business out of it  create profits and jobs  and the hope is that  as we are rethinking sanitation  we are extending the life of these pits so that we don't have to resort to quick solutions that don't really make sense. I believe that access to adequate sanitation is a basic human right. We need to stop the practice of lower castes and lower status people going down and being condemned to empty pits. It is our moral  it is our social and our environmental obligation. Thank you. Women represent    percent of middle management and professional positions  but the percentages of women at the top of organizations represent not even a third of that number. So some people hear that statistic and they ask  why do we have so few women leaders  But I look at that statistic and  if you  like me  believe that leadership manifests at every level  you would see that there's a tremendous  awesome resource of leaders who are leading in middle management  which raises a different question  Why are there so many women mired in the middle and what has to happen to take them to the top  So some of you might be some of those women who are in middle management and seeking to move up in your organization. Well  Tonya is a great example of one of these women. I met her two years ago. She was a vice president in a Fortune    company  and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration   I've worked really hard to improve my confidence and my assertiveness and develop a great brand  I get terrific performance evals from my boss  my    s in the organization let me know that my teams love working for me  I've taken every management course that I can here  I am working with a terrific mentor  and yet I've been passed over twice for advancement opportunities  even when my manager knows that I'm committed to moving up and even interested in an international assignment. I don't understand why I'm being passed over.  So what Tonya doesn't realize is that there's a missing    percent of the career success equation for women  and it's understanding what this missing    percent is that's required to close the gender gap at the top. In order to move up in organizations  you have to be known for your leadership skills  and this would apply to any of you  women or men. It means that you have to be recognized for using the greatness in you to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes by engaging the greatness in others. Put in other language  it means you have to use your skills and talents and abilities to help the organization achieve its strategic financial goals and do that by working effectively with others inside of the organization and outside. And although all three of these elements of leadership are important  when it comes to moving up in organizations  they aren't equally important. So pay attention to the green box as I move forward. In seeking and identifying employees with high potential  the potential to go to the top of organizations  the skills and competencies that relate to that green box are rated twice as heavily as those in the other two elements of leadership. These skills and competencies can be summarized as business  strategic  and financial acumen. In other words  this skill set has to do with understanding where the organization is going  what its strategy is  what financial targets it has in place  and understanding your role in moving the organization forward. This is that missing    percent of the career success equation for women  not because it's missing in our capabilities or abilities  but because it's missing in the advice that we're given. Here's what I mean by that. Five years ago  I was asked to moderate a panel of executives  and the topic for the evening was  What do you look for in  high potential employees   So think about the three elements of leadership as I summarize for you what they told me. They said   We look for people who are smart and hard working and committed and trustworthy and resilient.  So which element of leadership does that relate to  Personal greatness. They said   We look for employees who are great with our customers  who empower their teams  who negotiate effectively  who are able to manage conflict well  and are overall great communicators.  Which element of leadership does that equate to  Engaging the greatness in others. And then they pretty much stopped. So I asked   Well  what about people who understand your business  where it's going  and their role in taking it there  And what about people who are able to scan the external environment  identify risks and opportunities  make strategy or make strategic recommendations  And what about people who are able to look at the financials of your business  understand the story that the financials tell  and either take appropriate action or make appropriate recommendations   And to a man  they said   That's a given.  So I turned to the audience of     women and I asked   How many of you have ever been told that the door opener for career advancement is your business  strategic and financial acumen  and that all the other important stuff is what differentiates you in the talent pool   Three women raised their hand  and I've asked this question of women all around the globe in the five years since  and the percentage is never much different. So this is obvious  right  But how can it be  Well  there are primarily three reasons that there's this missing    percent in the career success advice given to women  When organizations direct women toward resources that focus on the conventional advice that we've been hearing for over    years  there's a notable absence of advice that relates to business  strategic and financial acumen. Much of the advice is emphasizing personal actions that we need to take  like become more assertive  become more confident  develop your personal brand  things that Tonya's been working on  and advice about working with other people  things like learn to self promote  get a mentor  enhance your network  and virtually nothing said about the importance of business  strategic and financial acumen. This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant. What it means is that this is advice that's absolutely essential for breaking through from career start to middle management  but it's not the advice that gets women to break through from the middle  where we're    percent  to senior and executive positions. And this is why conventional advice to women in    years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top and won't close it. Now  the second reason relates to Tonya's comments about having had excellent performance evals  great feedback from her teams  and having taken every management training program she can lay her hands on. So you would think that she's getting messages from her organization through the talent development systems and performance management systems that let her know how important it is to develop business  strategic and financial acumen  but here again  that green square is quite small. On average  talent and performance management systems in the organizations that I've worked with focus three to one on the other two elements of leadership compared to the importance of business  strategic and financial acumen  which is why typical talent and performance systems haven't closed and won't close the gender gap at the top. Now  Tonya also talked about working with a mentor  and this is really important to talk about  because if organizations  talent and performance systems aren't giving people in general information about the importance of business  strategic and financial acumen  how are men getting to the top  Well  there are primarily two ways. One is because of the positions they're guided into  and the other is because of informal mentoring and sponsorship. So what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring  Well  this comment from an executive that I worked with recently illustrates that experience. He was very proud of the fact that last year  he had two prot g s  a man and a woman. And he said   I helped the woman build confidence  I helped the man learn the business  and I didn't realize that I was treating them any differently.  And he was sincere about that. So what this illustrates is that as managers  whether we're women or men  we have mindsets about women and men  about careers in leadership  and these unexamined mindsets won't close the gender gap at the top. So how do we take this idea of the missing    percent and turn it into action  Well  for women  the answer is obvious  we have to begin to focus more on developing and demonstrating the skills we have that show that we're people who understand our businesses  where they're headed  and our role in taking it there. That's what enables that breakthrough from middle management to leadership at the top. But you don't have to be a middle manager to do this. One young scientist that works in a biotech firm used her insight about the missing    percent to weave financial impact data into a project update she did and got tremendous positive feedback from the managers in the room. So we don't want to put     percent of the responsibility on women's shoulders  nor would it be wise to do so  and here's why  In order for companies to achieve their strategic financial goals  executives understand that they have to have everyone pulling in the same direction. In other words  the term we use in business is  we have to have strategic alignment. And executives know this very well  and yet only    percent  according to a recent Conference Board report  believe that they have that strategic alignment in place. So for    percent of organizations  achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable. And if you think about what I've just shared  that you have situations where at least    percent of your middle managers haven't received clear messaging that they have to become focused on the business  where it's headed  and their role in taking it there  it's not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low  which is why there are other people who have a role to play in this. It's important for directors on boards to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions. Why  Because if they aren't seeing that  it could be a red flag that their organization isn't as aligned as it could potentially be. It's important for CEOs to also expect these proportional pools  and if they hear comments like   Well  she doesn't have enough business experience   ask the question   What are we going to do about that   It's important for H.R. executives to make sure that the missing    percent is appropriately emphasized  and it's important for women and men who are in management positions to examine the mindsets we hold about women and men  about careers and success  to make sure we are creating a level playing field for everybody. So let me close with the latest chapter in Tonya's story. Tonya emailed me two months ago  and she said that she had been interviewed for a new position  and during the interview  they probed about her business acumen and her strategic insights into the industry  and she said that she was so happy to report that now she has a new position reporting directly to the  chief information officer at her company. So for some of you  the missing    percent is an idea for you to put into action  and I hope that for all of you  you will see it as an idea worth spreading in order to help organizations be more effective  to help women create careers that soar  and to help close the gender gap at the top. Thank you.
