Motor racing is a funny old business. We make a new car every year  and then we spend the rest of the season trying to understand what it is we've built to make it better  to make it faster. And then the next year  we start again. Now  the car you see in front of you is quite complicated. The chassis is made up of about        components  the engine another        the electronics about eight and a half thousand. So there's about        things there that can go wrong. So motor racing is very much about attention to detail. The other thing about Formula   in particular is we're always changing the car. We're always trying to make it faster. So every two weeks  we will be making about       new components to fit to the car. Five to    percent of the race car will be different every two weeks of the year. So how do we do that  Well  we start our life with the racing car. We have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things. On the race car in front of you here there are about     sensors when it goes into a race. It's measuring all sorts of things around the car. That data is logged. We're logging about     different parameters within the data systems  about        health parameters and events to say when things are not working the way they should do  and we're sending that data back to the garage using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second. So during a two hour race  each car will be sending     million numbers. That's twice as many numbers as words that each of us speaks in a lifetime. It's a huge amount of data. But it's not enough just to have data and measure it. You need to be able to do something with it. So we've spent a lot of time and effort in turning the data into stories to be able to tell  what's the state of the engine  how are the tires degrading  what's the situation with fuel consumption  So all of this is taking data and turning it into knowledge that we can act upon. Okay  so let's have a look at a little bit of data. Let's pick a bit of data from another three month old patient. This is a child  and what you're seeing here is real data  and on the far right hand side  where everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic  that is the patient going into cardiac arrest. It was deemed to be an unpredictable event. This was a heart attack that no one could see coming. But when we look at the information there  we can see that things are starting to become a little fuzzy about five minutes or so before the cardiac arrest. We can see small changes in things like the heart rate moving. These were all undetected by normal thresholds which would be applied to data. So the question is  why couldn't we see it  Was this a predictable event  Can we look more at the patterns in the data to be able to do things better  So this is a child  about the same age as the racing car on stage  three months old. It's a patient with a heart problem. Now  when you look at some of the data on the screen above  things like heart rate  pulse  oxygen  respiration rates  they're all unusual for a normal child  but they're quite normal for the child there  and so one of the challenges you have in health care is  how can I look at the patient in front of me  have something which is specific for her  and be able to detect when things start to change  when things start to deteriorate  Because like a racing car  any patient  when things start to go bad  you have a short time to make a difference. So what we did is we took a data system which we run every two weeks of the year in Formula   and we installed it on the hospital computers at Birmingham Children's Hospital. We streamed data from the bedside instruments in their pediatric intensive care so that we could both look at the data in real time and  more importantly  to store the data so that we could start to learn from it. And then  we applied an application on top which would allow us to tease out the patterns in the data in real time so we could see what was happening  so we could determine when things started to change. Now  in motor racing  we're all a little bit ambitious  audacious  a little bit arrogant sometimes  so we decided we would also look at the children as they were being transported to intensive care. Why should we wait until they arrived in the hospital before we started to look  And so we installed a real time link between the ambulance and the hospital  just using normal  G telephony to send that data so that the ambulance became an extra bed in intensive care. And then we started looking at the data. So the wiggly lines at the top  all the colors  this is the normal sort of data you would see on a monitor    heart rate  pulse  oxygen within the blood  and respiration. The lines on the bottom  the blue and the red  these are the interesting ones. The red line is showing an automated version of the early warning score that Birmingham Children's Hospital were already running. They'd been running that since       and already have stopped cardiac arrests and distress within the hospital. The blue line is an indication of when patterns start to change  and immediately  before we even started putting in clinical interpretation  we can see that the data is speaking to us. It's telling us that something is going wrong. The plot with the red and the green blobs  this is plotting different components of the data against each other. The green is us learning what is normal for that child. We call it the cloud of normality. And when things start to change  when conditions start to deteriorate  we move into the red line. There's no rocket science here. It is displaying data that exists already in a different way  to amplify it  to provide cues to the doctors  to the nurses  so they can see what's happening. In the same way that a good racing driver relies on cues to decide when to apply the brakes  when to turn into a corner  we need to help our physicians and our nurses to see when things are starting to go wrong. So we have a very ambitious program. We think that the race is on to do something differently. We are thinking big. It's the right thing to do. We have an approach which  if it's successful  there's no reason why it should stay within a hospital. It can go beyond the walls. With wireless connectivity these days  there is no reason why patients  doctors and nurses always have to be in the same place at the same time. And meanwhile  we'll take our little three month old baby  keep taking it to the track  keeping it safe  and making it faster and better. Thank you very much. I'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before  What is possible with the human voice  What is possible with the human voice    Ooh baby     baby     baby     baby    Baby crying    baby    Baby crying    baby    Cat meowing  Yeah. It was coming straight for me. I had to. It was  yeah. As you can probably well imagine  I was a strange child. Because the thing is  I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be. I was constantly experimenting with these noises. And I'm still on that mission. I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make. And the thing is  I'm a bit older and wiser now  and I know that there's some noises I'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body  and there's things it can't do. And there's things that no one's voice can do. For example  no one can do two notes at the same time. You can do two tone singing  which monks can do  which is like... But that's cheating. And it hurts your throat. So there's things you can't do  and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me  because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world  but they're sketches at best  which is what's annoyed me. If only  if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it. So I've been working with these guys  and we've made a machine. We've made a system which is basically a live production machine  a real time music production machine  and it enables me to  using nothing but my voice  create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me. And I'm going to show you what it can do. And before I start making noises with it  and using it to manipulate my voice  I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice. This system has    thank you  beautiful assistant    this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it  so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind. So once this thing really gets going  and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it  it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice  but it is  so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple. So the polyphony problem  I've only got one voice. How do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time. The simplest way to do it is something like this. By dancing. It's like this. Thanks. So that's probably the easiest way. But if you want to do something a little bit more immediate  something that you can't achieve with live looping  there's other ways to layer your voice up. There's things like pitch shifting  which are awesome  and I'm going to show you now what that sounds like. So I'm going to start another beat for you  like this. There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start  because it's just fun  so you can clap along if you want. You don't have to. It's fine. Check it out. I'm going to lay down a bass sound now. And now  a rockabilly guitar. Which is nice. But what if I want to make  say  a     Applause     Thanks. What if I want to make  say  a rock organ  Is that possible  Yes  it is  by recording myself like this. And now I have that  I have that recorded. Assign it to a keyboard. So that's cool. But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd  Impossible  you say. No. It is possible  and you can do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out. So every noise you can hear there is my voice. I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that. There's no samples. There's no synthesizers. That is literally all my voice being manipulated  and when you get to that point  you have to ask  don't you  what's the point  Why do this   Laughter  Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd  I suppose  is the easy answer. But in actual fact  I haven't made this machine so that I can emulate things that already exist. I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine. So with your permission  I'm going to do some things that are in my mind  and I hope you enjoy them  because they're rather unusual  especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this  it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice  you see. Like this. So  loosely defined  that is what's possible with the human voice. Thank you very much  ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dan Cohen and I am an academic  as he said. And what that means is that I argue. It's an important part of my life. And I like to argue. And I'm not just an academic  I'm a philosopher  so I like to think that I'm actually pretty good at arguing. But I also like to think a lot about arguing. And in thinking about arguing  I've come across some puzzles. And one of the puzzles is that  as I've been thinking about arguing over the years    and it's been decades now    I've gotten better at arguing. But the more that I argue and the better I get at arguing  the more that I lose. And that's a puzzle. And the other puzzle is that I'm actually okay with that. Why is it that I'm okay with losing and why is it that I think good arguers are actually better at losing  Well  there are some other puzzles. One is  why do we argue  Who benefits from arguments  When I think about arguments  I'm talking about    let's call them academic arguments or cognitive arguments    where something cognitive is at stake  Is this proposition true  Is this theory a good theory  Is this a viable interpretation of the data or the text  And so on. I'm not interested really in arguments about whose turn it is to do the dishes or who has to take out the garbage. Yeah  we have those arguments  too. I tend to win those arguments  because I know the tricks. But those aren't the important arguments. I'm interested in academic arguments  and here are the things that puzzle me. First  what do good arguers win when they win an argument  What do I win if I convince you that utilitarianism isn't really the right framework for thinking about ethical theories  What do we win when we win an argument  Even before that  what does it matter to me whether you have this idea that Kant's theory works or Mill is the right ethicist to follow  It's no skin off my back whether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind. So why do we even try to argue  Why do we try to convince other people to believe things they don't want to believe  and is that even a nice thing to do  Is that a nice way to treat another human being  try and make them think something they don't want to think  Well  my answer is going to make reference to three models for arguments. The first model    let's call it the dialectical model    is we think of arguments as war  you know what that's like    a lot of screaming and shouting and winning and losing. That's not a very helpful model for arguing  but it's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing. But there's a second model for arguing  arguments as proofs. Think of a mathematician's argument. Here's my argument. Does it work  Is it any good  Are the premises warranted  Are the inferences valid  Does the conclusion follow from the premises  No opposition  no adversariality    not necessarily any arguing in the adversarial sense. But there's a third model to keep in mind that I think is going to be very helpful  and that is arguments as performances  arguments in front of an audience. We can think of a politician trying to present a position  trying to convince the audience of something. But there's another twist on this model that I really think is important  namely  that when we argue before an audience  sometimes the audience has a more participatory role in the argument  that is  arguments are also  performances  in front of juries  who make a judgment and decide the case. Let's call this the rhetorical model  where you have to tailor your argument to the audience at hand. You know  presenting a sound  well argued  tight argument in English before a francophone audience just isn't going to work. So we have these models    argument as war  argument as proof and argument as performance. Of those three  the argument as war is the dominant one. It dominates how we talk about arguments  it dominates how we think about arguments  and because of that  it shapes how we argue  our actual conduct in arguments. Now  when we talk about arguments  we talk in a very militaristic language. We want strong arguments  arguments that have a lot of punch  arguments that are right on target. We want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order. We want killer arguments. That's the kind of argument we want. It is the dominant way of thinking about arguments. When I'm talking about arguments  that's probably what you thought of  the adversarial model. But the war metaphor  the war paradigm or model for thinking about arguments  has  I think  deforming effects on how we argue. First  it elevates tactics over substance. You can take a class in logic  argumentation. You learn all about the subterfuges that people use to try and win arguments    the false steps. It magnifies the us versus them aspect of it. It makes it adversarial  it's polarizing. And the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph    glorious triumph    or abject  ignominious defeat. I think those are deforming effects  and worst of all  it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation or compromise or collaboration. Think about that one    have you ever entered an argument thinking   Let's see if we can hash something out  rather than fight it out. What can we work out together   I think the argument as war metaphor inhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation. And finally    this is really the worst thing    arguments don't seem to get us anywhere  they're dead ends. They are like roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock in conversation. We don't get anywhere. And one more thing. And as an educator  this is the one that really bothers me  If argument is war  then there's an implicit equation of learning with losing. And let me explain what I mean. Suppose you and I have an argument. You believe a proposition  P  and I don't. And I say   Well  why do you believe P   And you give me your reasons. And I object and say   Well  what about ...   And you answer my objection. And I have a question   Well  what do you mean  How does it apply over here   And you answer my question. Now  suppose at the end of the day  I've objected  I've questioned  I've raised all sorts of counter counter considerations and in every case you've responded to my satisfaction. And so at the end of the day  I say   You know what  I guess you're right  P.  So  I have a new belief. And it's not just any belief  it's well articulated  examined    it's a battle tested belief. Great cognitive gain. OK  who won that argument  Well  the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won  even though I'm the only one who made any cognitive gain. What did you gain  cognitively  from convincing me  Sure  you got some pleasure out of it  maybe your ego stroked  maybe you get some professional status in the field     This guy's a good arguer.  But just from a cognitive point of view  who was the winner  The war metaphor forces us into thinking that you're the winner and I lost  even though I gained. And there's something wrong with that picture. And that's the picture I really want to change if we can. So  how can we find ways to make arguments yield something positive  What we need is new exit strategies for arguments. But we're not going to have new exit strategies for arguments until we have new entry approaches to arguments. We need to think of new kinds of arguments. In order to do that  well    I don't know how to do that. That's the bad news. The argument as war metaphor is just ... it's a monster. It's just taken up habitation in our mind  and there's no magic bullet that's going to kill it. There's no magic wand that's going to make it disappear. I don't have an answer. But I have some suggestions. Here's my suggestion  If we want to think of new kinds of arguments  what we need to do is think of new kinds of arguers. So try this  Think of all the roles that people play in arguments. There's the proponent and the opponent in an adversarial  dialectical argument. There's the audience in rhetorical arguments. There's the reasoner in arguments as proofs. All these different roles. Now  can you imagine an argument in which you are the arguer  but you're also in the audience  watching yourself argue  Can you imagine yourself watching yourself argue  losing the argument  and yet still  at the end of the argument  saying   Wow  that was a good argument   Can you do that  I think you can  and I think if you can imagine that kind of argument  where the loser says to the winner and the audience and the jury can say   Yeah  that was a good argument   then you have imagined a good argument. And more than that  I think you've imagined a good arguer  an arguer that's worthy of the kind of arguer you should try to be. Now  I lose a lot of arguments. It takes practice to become a good arguer  in the sense of being able to benefit from losing  but fortunately  I've had many  many colleagues who have been willing to step up and provide that practice for me. Thank you. In an age of global strife and climate change  I'm here to answer the all important question  Why is sex so damn good  If you're laughing  you know what I mean. Now  before we get to that answer  let me tell you about Chris Hosmer. Chris is a great friend of mine from my university days  but secretly  I hate him. Here's why. Back in university  we had a quick project to design some solar powered clocks. Here's my clock. It uses something called the dwarf sunflower  which grows to about    inches in height. Now  as you know  sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day. So in the morning  you see which direction the sunflower is facing  and you mark it on the blank area in the base. At noon  you mark the changed position of the sunflower  and in the evening again  and that's your clock. Now  I know my clock doesn't tell you the exact time  but it does give you a general idea using a flower. So  in my completely unbiased  subjective opinion  it's brilliant. However  here's Chris' clock. It's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one. In each shot glass is a different scented oil. In the morning  the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass  focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath. This will warm up the scented oil inside  and a particular smell will be emitted. A couple of hours later  the sun will shine on the next magnifying glass  and a different smell will be emitted. So during the course of the day  five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment. Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell. You can see why I hate Chris. I thought my idea was pretty good  but his idea is genius  and at the time  I knew his idea was better than mine  but I just couldn't explain why. One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose. This problem's been bugging me for well over a decade. All right  let's get back to the question of why sex is so good. Many years after the solar powered clocks project  a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses. And when she said this  I had an epiphany. So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses. To do this  I devised something called the five senses graph. Along the y axis  you have a scale from zero to     and along the x axis  you have  of course  the five senses. Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life  I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary. Here's a quick video to show you how it works. and today  I'm going to show you what riding motorbikes is like from the point of view of the five senses. Hey  Bike designer  This is  unclear   custom bike designer.  Sound   Touch   Sight   Smell   Taste  JL  And that's how the five senses graph works. Now  for a period of three years  I gathered data  not just me but also some of my friends  and I used to teach in university  so I forced my    I mean  I asked my students to do this as well. So here are some other results. The first is for instant noodles. Now obviously  taste and smell are quite high  but notice sound is at three. Many people told me a big part of the noodle eating experience is the slurping noise. You know.  Slurps  Needless to say  I no longer dine with these people. Okay  next  clubbing. Okay  here what I found interesting was that taste is at four  and many respondents told me it's because of the taste of drinks  but also  in some cases  kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience. These people I still do hang out with. All right  and smoking. Here I found touch is at  six   and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience  which shows  it's kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers. Okay. Now  what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph  It would  of course  be a horizontal line along the top. Now you can see  not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close. In fact  in the years that I gathered data  only one experience came close to being the perfect one. That is  of course  sex. Great sex. Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level. Here I'll quote one of my students who said   Sex is so good  it's good even when it's bad.  So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good. Now in the middle of all this five senses work  I suddenly remembered the solar powered clocks project from my youth. And I realized this theory also explains why Chris' clock is so much better than mine. You see  my clock only focuses on sight  and a little bit of touch. Here's Chris' clock. It's the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time. In fact  in terms of the five senses  Chris' clock is a revolution. And that's what this theory taught me about my field. You see  up till now  us designers  we've mainly focused on making things look very pretty  and a little bit of touch  which means we've ignored the other three senses. Chris' clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product. So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs  Here's three quick ideas I came up with. This is an iron  you know  for your clothes  to which I added a spraying mechanism  so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent  and your clothes will smell nicer  but hopefully it should also make the ironing experience more enjoyable. We could call this  the perfumator.  All right  next. So I brush my teeth twice a day  and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy  and when the taste of candy ran out  you'd know it's time to change your toothbrush  Finally  I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet. It's not just the way they look  but I love the way they feel when you press down on them. Now  I don't play the flute or the clarinet  so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play  the television remote control. Now  when we look at these three ideas together  you'll notice that the five senses theory doesn't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look. So in conclusion  I've found the five senses theory to be a very useful tool in evaluating different experiences in my life  and then taking those best experiences and hopefully incorporating them into my designs. Now  I realize the five senses isn't the only thing that makes life interesting. There's also the six emotions and that elusive x factor. Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk. Until then  please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs. Oh  one last thing before I leave. Here's the experience you all had while listening to the TED Talks. However  it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses like smell and taste. And the best way to do that is with free candy. You guys ready  All right. I moved back home    years ago after a    year stay in the United States  and Africa called me back. And I founded my country's first graphic design and new media college. And I called it the Zimbabwe Institute of Vigital Arts. The idea  the dream  was really for a sort of Bauhaus sort of school where new ideas were interrogated and investigated  the creation of a new visual language based on the African creative heritage. We offer a two year diploma to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education. And typography's a very important part of the curriculum and we encourage our students to look inward for influence. Here's a poster designed by one of the students under the theme  Education is a right.  Some logos designed by my students. Africa has had a long tradition of writing  but this is not such a well known fact  and I wrote the book  Afrikan Alphabets  to address that. The different types of writing in Africa  first was proto writing  as illustrated by Nsibidi  which is the writing system of a secret society of the Ejagham people in southern Nigeria. So it's a special interest writing system. The Akan of people of Ghana and  Cote d'Ivoire  developed Adinkra symbols some     years ago  and these are proverbs  historical sayings  objects  animals  plants  and my favorite Adinkra system is the first one at the top on the left. It's called Sankofa. It means   Return and get it.  Learn from the past. This pictograph by the Jokwe people of Angola tells the story of the creation of the world. At the top is God  at the bottom is man  mankind  and on the left is the sun  on the right is the moon. All the paths lead to and from God. These secret societies of the Yoruba  Kongo and Palo religions in Nigeria  Congo and Angola respectively  developed this intricate writing system which is alive and well today in the New World in Cuba  Brazil and Trinidad and Haiti. In the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo  in the Ituri society  the men pound out a cloth out of a special tree  and the women  who are also the praise singers  paint interweaving patterns that are the same in structure as the polyphonic structures that they use in their singing    a sort of a musical score  if you may. In South Africa  Ndebele women use these symbols and other geometric patterns to paint their homes in bright colors  and the Zulu women use the symbols in the beads that they weave into bracelets and necklaces. Ethiopia has had the longest tradition of writing  with the Ethiopic script that was developed in the fourth century A.D. and is used to write Amharic  which is spoken by over    million people. King Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum Kingdom of Cameroon developed Sh  mom at the age of   . Sh  mom is a writing system. It's a syllabary. It's not exactly an alphabet. And here we see three stages of development that it went through in    years. The Vai people of Liberia had a long tradition of literacy before their first contact with Europeans in the     s. It's a syllabary and reads from left to right. Next door  in Sierra Leone  the Mende also developed a syllabary  but theirs reads from right to left. Africa has had a long tradition of design  a well defined design sensibility  but the problem in Africa has been that  especially today  designers in Africa struggle with all forms of design because they are more apt to look outward for influence and inspiration. The creative spirit in Africa  the creative tradition  is as potent as it has always been  if only designers could look within. This Ethiopic cross illustrates what Dr. Ron Eglash has established  that Africa has a lot to contribute to computing and mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals. Africans of antiquity created civilization  and their monuments  which still stand today  are a true testimony of their greatness. Most probably  one of humanity's greatest achievements is the invention of the alphabet  and that has been attributed to Mesopotamia with their invention of cuneiform in      BC  followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt  and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact. That is  until       when one Yale professor John Coleman Darnell discovered these inscriptions in the Thebes desert on the limestone cliffs in western Egypt  and these have been dated at between      and      B.C.  centuries before Mesopotamia. Called Wadi el Hol because of the place that they were discovered  these inscriptions    research is still going on  a few of them have been deciphered  but there is consensus among scholars that this is really humanity's first alphabet. Over here  you see a paleographic chart that shows what has been deciphered so far  starting with the letter A    lep   at the top  and  b t   in the middle  and so forth. It is time that students of design in Africa read the works of titans like Cheikh Anta Diop  Senegal's Cheikh Anta Diop  whose seminal work on Egypt is vindicated by this discovery. The last word goes to the great Jamaican leader Marcus Mosiah Garvey and the Akan people of Ghana with their Adinkra symbol Sankofa  which encourages us to go to the past so as to inform our present and build on a future for us and our children. It is also time that designers in Africa stop looking outside. They've been looking outward for a long time  yet what they were looking for has been right there within grasp  right within them. Thank you very much. The day I left home for the first time to go to university was a bright day brimming with hope and optimism. I'd done well at school. Expectations for me were high  and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures  parties and traffic cone theft. Now appearances  of course  can be deceptive  and to an extent  this feisty  energetic persona of lecture going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer  albeit a very well crafted and convincing one. Underneath  I was actually deeply unhappy  insecure and fundamentally frightened    frightened of other people  of the future  of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me. But I was skilled at hiding it  and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and aspire to. This fantasy of invulnerability was so complete that I even deceived myself  and as the first semester ended and the second began  there was no way that anyone could have predicted what was just about to happen. I was leaving a seminar when it started  humming to myself  fumbling with my bag just as I'd done a hundred times before  when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe   She is leaving the room.  I looked around  and there was no one there  but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable. Shaken  I left my books on the stairs and hurried home  and there it was again.  She is opening the door.  This was the beginning. The voice had arrived. And the voice persisted  days and then weeks of it  on and on  narrating everything I did in the third person.  She is going to the library.   She is going to a lecture.  It was neutral  impassive and even  after a while  strangely companionate and reassuring  although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion. So  for example  if I was angry and had to hide it  which I often did  being very adept at concealing how I really felt  then the voice would sound frustrated. Otherwise  it was neither sinister nor disturbing  although even at that point it was clear that it had something to communicate to me about my emotions  particularly emotions which were remote and inaccessible. Now it was then that I made a fatal mistake  in that I told a friend about the voice  and she was horrified. A subtle conditioning process had begun  the implication that normal people don't hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong. Such fear and mistrust was infectious. Suddenly the voice didn't seem quite so benign anymore  and when she insisted that I seek medical attention  I duly complied  and which proved to be mistake number two. I spent some time telling the college G.P. about what I perceived to be the real problem  anxiety  low self worth  fears about the future  and was met with bored indifference until I mentioned the voice  upon which he dropped his pen  swung round and began to question me with a show of real interest. And to be fair  I was desperate for interest and help  and I began to tell him about my strange commentator. And I always wish  at this point  the voice had said   She is digging her own grave.  I was referred to a psychiatrist  who likewise took a grim view of the voice's presence  subsequently interpreting everything I said through a lens of latent insanity. For example  I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus  and during an appointment which was running very late  I said   I'm sorry  doctor  I've got to go. I'm reading the news at six.  Now it's down on my medical records that Eleanor has delusions that she's a television news broadcaster. It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me. A hospital admission followed  the first of many  a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next  and then  worst of all  a toxic  tormenting sense of hopelessness  humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects. But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom  my fear and resistance towards it intensified. Now essentially  this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind  a kind of psychic civil war  and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing. Helplessly and hopelessly  I began to retreat into this nightmarish inner world in which the voices were destined to become both my persecutors and my only perceived companions. They told me  for example  that if I proved myself worthy of their help  then they could change my life back to how it had been  and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set  a kind of labor of Hercules. It started off quite small  for example  pull out three strands of hair  but gradually it grew more extreme  culminating in commands to harm myself  and a particularly dramatic instruction   You see that tutor over there  You see that glass of water  Well  you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students.  Which I actually did  and which needless to say did not endear me to the faculty. In effect  a vicious cycle of fear  avoidance  mistrust and misunderstanding had been established  and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation. Two years later  and the deterioration was dramatic. By now  I had the whole frenzied repertoire  terrifying voices  grotesque visions  bizarre  intractable delusions. My mental health status had been a catalyst for discrimination  verbal abuse  and physical and sexual assault  and I'd been told by my psychiatrist   Eleanor  you'd be better off with cancer  because cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia.  I'd been diagnosed  drugged and discarded  and was by now so tormented by the voices that I attempted to drill a hole in my head in order to get them out. Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years  it seems to me now as if someone died in that place  and yet  someone else was saved. A broken and haunted person began that journey  but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be. Many people have harmed me in my life  and I remember them all  but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who've helped me. The fellow survivors  the fellow voice hearers  the comrades and collaborators  the mother who never gave up on me  who knew that one day I would come back to her and was willing to wait for me for as long as it took  the doctor who only worked with me for a brief time but who reinforced his belief that recovery was not only possible but inevitable  and during a devastating period of relapse told my terrified family   Don't give up hope. I believe that Eleanor can get through this. Sometimes  you know  it snows as late as May  but summer always comes eventually.  Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized  lonely place. But together  they forged a blend of courage  creativity  integrity  and an unshakeable belief that my shattered self could become healed and whole. I used to say that these people saved me  but what I now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself  and crucially  they helped me to understand something which I'd always suspected  that my voices were a meaningful response to traumatic life events  particularly childhood events  and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into solvable emotional problems. Now  at first  this was very difficult to believe  not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing  so in this respect  a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth. So for example  voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world  rather than an actual  objective danger. Now at first  I would have believed them. I remember  for example  sitting up one night on guard outside my parents' room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices. Because I'd had such a bad problem with self injury that most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden  so I ended up arming myself with a plastic fork  kind of like picnic ware  and sort of sat outside the room clutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen. It was like   Don't mess with me. I've got a plastic fork  don't you know   Strategic. But a later response  and much more useful  would be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words  so when the voices warned me not to leave the house  then I would thank them for drawing my attention to how unsafe I felt    because if I was aware of it  then I could do something positive about it    but go on to reassure both them and myself that we were safe and didn't need to feel frightened anymore. I would set boundaries for the voices  and try to interact with them in a way that was assertive yet respectful  establishing a slow process of communication and collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another. Throughout all of this  what I would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself  and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had an opportunity to process or resolve  memories of sexual trauma and abuse  of anger  shame  guilt  low self worth. The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it  and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly  and as such  it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care. It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self  each fragment represented by a different voice  gradually withdraw from all my medication  and return to psychiatry  only this time from the other side. Ten years after the voice first came  I finally graduated  this time with the highest degree in psychology the university had ever given  and one year later  the highest masters  which shall we say isn't bad for a madwoman. In fact  one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam  which technically possibly counts as cheating. And to be honest  sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well. As Oscar Wilde has said  the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. It also makes you very good at eavesdropping  because you can listen to two conversations simultaneously. So it's not all bad. I worked in mental health services  I spoke at conferences  I published book chapters and academic articles  and I argued  and continue to do so  the relevance of the following concept  that an important question in psychiatry shouldn't be what's wrong with you but rather what's happened to you. And all the while  I listened to my voices  with whom I'd finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn reflected a growing sense of compassion  acceptance and respect towards myself. And I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment when supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices  and becoming fully aware  for the very first time  that I no longer felt that way myself but was finally able to help someone else who was. I'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice  the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement  an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher  which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy  a sane reaction to insane circumstances  not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured  but a complex  significant and meaningful experience to be explored. Together  we envisage and enact a society that understands and respects voice hearing  supports the needs of individuals who hear voices  and which values them as full citizens. This type of society is not only possible  it's already on its way. To paraphrase Chavez  once social change begins  it cannot be reversed. You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride. You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore. For me  the achievements of the Hearing Voices Movement are a reminder that empathy  fellowship  justice and respect are more than words  they are convictions and beliefs  and that beliefs can change the world. In the last    years  the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in    countries across five continents  working together to promote dignity  solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress  to create a new language and practice of hope  which  at its very center  lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual. As Peter Levine has said  the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity. In this respect  for members of society  there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone  to bear witness  to reach out a hand  to share the burden of someone's suffering  and to hold the hope for their recovery. And likewise  for survivors of distress and adversity  that we remember we don't have to live our lives forever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us. We are unique. We are irreplaceable. What lies within us can never be truly colonized  contorted  or taken away. The light never goes out. As a very wonderful doctor once said to me   Don't tell me what other people have told you about yourself. Tell me about you.  Thank you. Adam Ockelford  I promise there won't be too much of me talking  and a lot of Derek playing  but I thought it would just be nice to recap on how Derek got to where he is today. It's amazing now  because he's so much bigger than me  but when Derek was born  he could have fitted on the palm of your hand. He was born three and a half months premature  and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive. He had to have a lot of oxygen  and that affected your eyes  Derek  and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world. But that was the end of the bad news  because when Derek came home from the hospital  his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you  Derek  really for the rest of your childhood. And Nanny's great insight  really  was to think  here's a child who can't see. Music must be the thing for Derek. And sure enough  she sang  or as Derek called it  warbled  to him for his first few years of life. And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe  you know  in his brain something was stirring  some sort of musical gift. Here's a little picture of Derek going up now  when you were with your nanny. Now Nanny's great other insight was to think  perhaps we should get Derek something to play  and sure enough  she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft  never thinking really that anything much would come of it. But Derek  your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it  bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break. But out of all the bashing  after a few months  emerged the most fantastic music  and I think there was just a miracle moment  really  Derek  when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard. That was the great eureka moment. Now  not being able to see meant  of course  that you taught yourself. Derek Paravicini  I taught myself to play. AO  You did teach yourself to play  and as a consequence  playing the piano for you  Derek  was a lot of knuckles and karate chops  and even a bit of nose going on in there. And now  here's what Nanny did also do was to press the record button on one of those little early tape recorders that they had  and this is a wonderful tape  now  of Derek playing when you were four years old. DP   Molly Malone  Cockles and Mussels .  AO  It wasn't actually  Cockles and Mussels.  This one is  English Country Garden.  DP   English Country Garden.  AO  There you are. I think that's just fantastic. You know  there's this little child who can't see  can't really understand much about the world  has no one in the family who plays an instrument  and yet he taught himself to play that. And as you can see from the picture  there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing  Derek. Now  along    Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old  and at first  Derek  I thought you were mad  to be honest  because when you played the piano  you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard  and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way. So as soon as I tried to get near the piano  I was firmly shoved off. And having said to your dad  Nic  that I would try to teach you  I was then slightly confused as to how I might go about that if I wasn't allowed near the piano. But after a while  I thought  well  the only way is to just pick you up  shove Derek over to the other side of the room  and in the    seconds that I got before Derek came back  I could just play something very quickly for him to learn. And in the end  Derek  I think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together. As you can see  there's me in my early  pre marriage days with a brown beard  and little Derek concentrating there. I just realized this is going to be recorded  isn't it  Right. Okay. Now then  by the age of     Derek really had taken the world by storm. This is a photo of you  Derek  playing at the Barbican with the Royal Philharmonic Pops. Basically it was just an exciting journey  really. And in those days  Derek  you didn't speak very much  and so there was always a moment of tension as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key  and all that kind of thing. But the orchestra were wowed as well  and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability to play these fantastic pieces. Now the question is  how do you do it  Derek  And hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do. I think that one of the first things that happened when you were very little  Derek  was that by the time you were two  your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults. And so whenever you heard any note at all    if I just play a random note    you knew instantly what it was  and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano. Now that's called perfect pitch  and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano. You can see how    you get a sense of playing with Derek. But Derek  your ear is so much more than that. If I just put the microphone down for a bit  I'm going to play a cluster of notes. Those of you who can see will know how many notes  but Derek  of course  can't. Not only can you say how many notes  it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are. Well  forget the terminology  Derek. Fantastic. And it's that ability  that ability to hear simultaneous sounds  not only just single sounds  but when a whole orchestra is playing  Derek  you can hear every note  and instantly  through all those hours and hours of practice  reproduce those on the keyboard  that makes you  I think  is the basis of all your ability. Now then. It's no use having that kind of raw ability without the technique  and luckily  Derek  you decided that  once we did start learning  you'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings. So for example using your thumb under with C major. Etc. And in the end  you got so quick  that things like  Flight of the Bumblebee  were no problem  were they  DP  No. AO  Right. So here  by the age of     Derek was playing things like this. DP  This. AO  Derek  let's have a bow. Well done. Now the truly amazing thing was  with all those scales  Derek  you could not only play  Flight of the Bumblebee  in the usual key  but any note I play  Derek can play it on. So if I just choose a note at random  like that one. Can you play  Flight of the Bumblebee  on that note  DP   Flight of the Bumblebee  on that note. AO  Or another one  How about in G minor  DP  G minor. AO  Fantastic. Well done  Derek. So you see  in your brain  Derek  is this amazing musical computer that can instantly recalibrate  recalculate  all the pieces in the world that are out there. Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said   Sorry  do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee' in B minor instead of A minor   as we went on. In fact  the first time  Derek  you played that with an orchestra  you'd learned the version that you'd learned  and then the orchestra  in fact  did have a different version  so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert  Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra. Fantastic chap. The other wonderful thing about you is memory. DP  Memory. AO  Your memory is truly amazing  and every concert we do  we ask the audience to participate  of course  by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play. And people say   Well  that's terribly brave because what happens if Derek doesn't know it   And I say   No  it's not brave at all  because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know  you're invited to come and sing it first  and then he'll pick it up.   Laughter  So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish. But seriously  would anyone like to choose a piece  DP  Choose a piece. Choose  choose  would you like to choose  AO  Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out. Would you like to hear me play  AO  Paganini. DP   The Theme of Paganini.  AO  Well done. Derek's going to L.A. soon  and it's a milestone  because it means that Derek and I will have spent over     hours on long haul flights together  which is quite interesting  isn't it Derek  DP  Very interesting  Adam  yes. Long haul flights. Yes. AO  You may think    hours is a long time to keep talking  but Derek does it effortlessly. Now then. But in America  they've coined this term   the human iPod  for Derek  which I think is just missing the point  really  because Derek  you're so much more than an iPod. You're a fantastic  creative musician  and I think that was nowhere clearer to see  really  than when we went to Slovenia  and someone    in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in  and this person  very  very nervously came onto the stage. DP  He played  Chopsticks.  AO  And played  Chopsticks.  DP   Chopsticks.  AO  A bit like this. DP  Like this. Yes. AO  I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it. He's sitting there. DP  Somebody played  Chopsticks  like this. AO  Just teasing  right  Here we go. DP  Let Derek play it. AO  What did you do with it  Derek  DP  I got to improvise with it  Adam. AO  This is Derek the musician. Keep up with Derek. The TED people will kill me  but perhaps there's time for one encore. DP  For one encore. AO  One encore  yes. So this is one of Derek's heroes. It's the great Art Tatum    DP  Art Tatum. AO     who also was a pianist who couldn't see  and also  I think  like Derek  thought that all the world was a piano  so whenever Art Tatum plays something  it sounds like there's three pianos in the room. And here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on  Tiger Rag.  DP   Tiger Rag.  In the northwest corner of the United States  right up near the Canadian border  there's a little town called Libby  Montana  and it's surrounded by pine trees and lakes and just amazing wildlife and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky. And in there is a little town called Libby  which I visited  which feels kind of lonely  a little isolated. And in Libby  Montana  there's a rather unusual woman named Gayla Benefield. She always felt a little bit of an outsider  although she's been there almost all her life  a woman of Russian extraction. She told me when she went to school  she was the only girl who ever chose to do mechanical drawing. Later in life  she got a job going house to house reading utility meters    gas meters  electricity meters. And she was doing the work in the middle of the day  and one thing particularly caught her notice  which was  in the middle of the day she met a lot of men who were at home  middle aged  late middle aged  and a lot of them seemed to be on oxygen tanks. It struck her as strange. Then  a few years later  her father died at the age of     five days before he was due to receive his pension. He'd been a miner. She thought he must just have been worn out by the work. But then a few years later  her mother died  and that seemed stranger still  because her mother came from a long line of people who just seemed to live forever. In fact  Gayla's uncle is still alive to this day  and learning how to waltz. It didn't make sense that Gayla's mother should die so young. It was an anomaly  and she kept puzzling over anomalies. And as she did  other ones came to mind. She remembered  for example  when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital  and she had a lot of x rays  and two of them were leg x rays  which made sense  but six of them were chest x rays  which didn't. She puzzled and puzzled over every piece of her life and her parents' life  trying to understand what she was seeing. She thought about her town. The town had a vermiculite mine in it. Vermiculite was used for soil conditioners  to make plants grow faster and better. Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts  huge amounts of it put under the roof to keep houses warm during the long Montana winters. Vermiculite was in the playground. It was in the football ground. It was in the skating rink. What she didn't learn until she started working this problem is vermiculite is a very toxic form of asbestos. When she figured out the puzzle  she started telling everyone she could what had happened  what had been done to her parents and to the people that she saw on oxygen tanks at home in the afternoons. But she was really amazed. She thought  when everybody knows  they'll want to do something  but actually nobody wanted to know. In fact  she became so annoying as she kept insisting on telling this story to her neighbors  to her friends  to other people in the community  that eventually a bunch of them got together and they made a bumper sticker  which they proudly displayed on their cars  which said   Yes  I'm from Libby  Montana  and no  I don't have asbestosis.  But Gayla didn't stop. She kept doing research. The advent of the Internet definitely helped her. She talked to anybody she could. She argued and argued  and finally she struck lucky when a researcher came through town studying the history of mines in the area  and she told him her story  and at first  of course  like everyone  he didn't believe her  but he went back to Seattle and he did his own research and he realized that she was right. So now she had an ally. Nevertheless  people still didn't want to know. They said things like   Well  if it were really dangerous  someone would have told us.   If that's really why everyone was dying  the doctors would have told us.  Some of the guys used to very heavy jobs said   I don't want to be a victim. I can't possibly be a victim  and anyway  every industry has its accidents.  But still Gayla went on  and finally she succeeded in getting a federal agency to come to town and to screen the inhabitants of the town           people    and what they discovered was that the town had a mortality rate    times higher than anywhere in the United States. That was in       and even at that moment  no one raised their hand to say   Gayla  look in the playground where your grandchildren are playing. It's lined with vermiculite.  This wasn't ignorance. It was willful blindness. Willful blindness is a legal concept which means  if there's information that you could know and you should know but you somehow manage not to know  the law deems that you're willfully blind. You have chosen not to know. There's a lot of willful blindness around these days. You can see willful blindness in banks  when thousands of people sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them. You could see them in banks when interest rates were manipulated and everyone around knew what was going on  but everyone studiously ignored it. You can see willful blindness in the Catholic Church  where decades of child abuse went ignored. You could see willful blindness in the run up to the Iraq War. Willful blindness exists on epic scales like those  and it also exists on very small scales  in people's families  in people's homes and communities  and particularly in organizations and institutions. Companies that have been studied for willful blindness can be asked questions like   Are there issues at work that people are afraid to raise   And when academics have done studies like this of corporations in the United States  what they find is    percent of people say yes. Eighty five percent of people know there's a problem  but they won't say anything. And when I duplicated the research in Europe  asking all the same questions  I found exactly the same number. Eighty five percent. That's a lot of silence. It's a lot of blindness. And what's really interesting is that when I go to companies in Switzerland  they tell me   This is a uniquely Swiss problem.  And when I go to Germany  they say   Oh yes  this is the German disease.  And when I go to companies in England  they say   Oh  yeah  the British are really bad at this.  And the truth is  this is a human problem. We're all  under certain circumstances  willfully blind. What the research shows is that some people are blind out of fear. They're afraid of retaliation. And some people are blind because they think  well  seeing anything is just futile. Nothing's ever going to change. If we make a protest  if we protest against the Iraq War  nothing changes  so why bother  Better not to see this stuff at all. And the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time is people say   Well  you know  the people who do see  they're whistleblowers  and we all know what happens to them.  So there's this profound mythology around whistleblowers which says  first of all  they're all crazy. But what I've found going around the world and talking to whistleblowers is  actually  they're very loyal and quite often very conservative people. They're hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for  and the reason that they speak up  the reason they insist on seeing  is because they care so much about the institution and want to keep it healthy. And the other thing that people often say about whistleblowers is   Well  there's no point  because you see what happens to them. They are crushed. Nobody would want to go through something like that.  And yet  when I talk to whistleblowers  the recurrent tone that I hear is pride. I think of Joe Darby. We all remember the photographs of Abu Ghraib  which so shocked the world and showed the kind of war that was being fought in Iraq. But I wonder who remembers Joe Darby  the very obedient  good soldier who found those photographs and handed them in. And he said   You know  I'm not the kind of guy to rat people out  but some things just cross the line. Ignorance is bliss  they say  but you can't put up with things like this.  I talked to Steve Bolsin  a British doctor  who fought for five years to draw attention to a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies. And I asked him why he did it  and he said   Well  it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it. She came up to me one night  and she just said  'Dad  you can't let the kids die.'  Or I think of Cynthia Thomas  a really loyal army daughter and army wife  who  as she saw her friends and relations coming back from the Iraq War  was so shocked by their mental condition and the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge post traumatic stress syndrome that she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town to give them legal  psychological and medical assistance. And she said to me  she said   You know  Margaret  I always used to say I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grow up. But I've found myself in this cause  and I'll never be the same.  We all enjoy so many freedoms today  hard won freedoms  the freedom to write and publish without fear of censorship  a freedom that wasn't here the last time I came to Hungary  a freedom to vote  which women in particular had to fight so hard for  the freedom for people of different ethnicities and cultures and sexual orientation to live the way that they want. But freedom doesn't exist if you don't use it  and what whistleblowers do  and what people like Gayla Benefield do is they use the freedom that they have. And what they're very prepared to do is recognize that yes  this is going to be an argument  and yes I'm going to have a lot of rows with my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends  but I'm going to become very good at this conflict. I'm going to take on the naysayers  because they'll make my argument better and stronger. I can collaborate with my opponents to become better at what I do. These are people of immense persistence  incredible patience  and an absolute determination not to be blind and not to be silent. When I went to Libby  Montana  I visited the asbestosis clinic that Gayla Benefield brought into being  a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went in the back door because they didn't want to acknowledge that she'd been right. I sat in a diner  and I watched as trucks drove up and down the highway  carting away the earth out of gardens and replacing it with fresh  uncontaminated soil. I took my    year old daughter with me  because I really wanted her to meet Gayla. And she said   Why  What's the big deal   I said   She's not a movie star  and she's not a celebrity  and she's not an expert  and Gayla's the first person who'd say she's not a saint. The really important thing about Gayla is she is ordinary. She's like you  and she's like me. She had freedom  and she was ready to use it.  Thank you very much. Hi. I am an architect. I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube  and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes.       much  much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues  I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure. It's very complicated to test the new material for the building  but this is much stronger than I expected  and also it's very easy to waterproof  and also  because it's industrial material  it's also possible to fireproof. Then I built the temporary structure      . This is the first temporary building made out of paper. There are     tubes  diameter     centimeters   there are only    tubes with a diameter of     centimeters  or four feet  wide. As you see it in the photo  inside is the toilet. In case you're finished with toilet paper  you can tear off the inside of the wall.  Laughter  So it's very useful. Year       there was a big expo in Germany. I was asked to design the building  because the theme of the expo was environmental issues. So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes  recyclable paper. My goal of the design is not when it's completed. My goal was when the building was demolished  because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year  we create a lot of industrial waste  so my building has to be reused or recycled. After  the building was recycled. So that was the goal of my design. Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz. Because I was so poor  I wanted to rent an office in Paris  but I couldn't afford it  so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves. So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the    meter long office. We stayed there for six years without paying any rent. Thank you. I had one big problem. Because we were part of the exhibition  even if my friend wanted to see me  they had to buy a ticket to see me. That was the problem. Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz. It's a very popular museum now  and I created a big monument for the government. But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect  because we are not helping  we are not working for society  but we are working for privileged people  rich people  government  developers. They have money and power. Those are invisible. So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture. That is our profession  even historically it's the same  even now we are doing the same. So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society  even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters. But I must say they are no longer natural disasters. For example  earthquakes never kill people  but collapse of the buildings kill people. That's the responsibility of architects. Then people need some temporary housing  but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people. So I thought  even as architects  we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing. We can make it better. So that is why I started working in disaster areas.       there was a big disaster in Rwanda  Africa. Two tribes  Hutu and Tutsi  fought each other. Over two million people became refugees. But I was so surprised to see the shelter  refugee camp organized by the U.N. They're so poor  and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season  In the shelters built by the U.N.  they were just providing a plastic sheet  and the refugees had to cut the trees  and just like this. But over two million people cut trees. It just became big  heavy deforestation and an environmental problem. That is why they started providing aluminum pipes  aluminum barracks. Very expensive  they throw them out for money  then cutting trees again. So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong  but my budget is only    U.S. dollars per unit. We built    units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites  so on. And then  year afterward        in Kobe  Japan  we had a big earthquake. Nearly       people were killed  and the city like this Nagata district  all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake. And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church    all the building was totally destroyed. So I went there and also I proposed to the priests   Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes   And he said   Oh God  are you crazy  After a fire  what are you proposing   So he never trusted me  but I didn't give up. I started commuting to Kobe  and I met the society of Vietnamese people. They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park. So I proposed to rebuild. I raised    did fundraising. I made a paper tube shelter for them  and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish  I used beer crates as a foundation. I asked the Kirin beer company to propose  because at that time  the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red  which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes. The color coordination is very important. And also I still remember  we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate  but it came empty.  Laughter  So I remember it was so disappointing. So during the summer with my students  we built over    units of the shelters. Finally the priest  finally he trusted me to rebuild. He said   As long as you collect money by yourself  bring your students to build  you can do it.  So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church. It was meant to stay there for three years  but actually it stayed there    years because people loved it. Then  in Taiwan  they had a big earthquake  and we proposed to donate this church  so we dismantled them  we sent them over to be built by volunteer people. It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now. So this building became a permanent building. Then I wonder  what is a permanent and what is a temporary building  Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it. Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money. In       in Turkey  the big earthquake  I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.       in West India  I built also a shelter. In       in Sri Lanka  after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami  I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages. And in       in Chengdu  Sichuan area in China  nearly        people were killed  and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor. I was asked to rebuild the temporary church. I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students. In one month  we completed nine classrooms  over     square meters. It's still used  even after the current earthquake in China. In       in Italy  L'Aquila  also they had a big earthquake. And this is a very interesting photo  former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso    you know  because we have to change the prime minister ever year. And they are very kind  affording my model. I proposed a big rebuilding  a temporary music hall  because L'Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed  so musicians were moving out. So I proposed to the mayor  I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium. He said   As long as you bring your money  you can do it.  And I was very lucky. Mr. Berlusconi brought G  summit  and our former prime minister came  so they helped us to collect money  and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium. Year      in Haiti  there was a big earthquake  but it's impossible to fly over  so I went to Santo Domingo  next door country  to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build    units of shelter out of local paper tubes. This is what happened in Japan two years ago  in northern Japan. After the earthquake and tsunami  people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium. But look at this. There's no privacy. People suffer mentally and physically. So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes  just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain. However  some of the facility authority doesn't want us to do it  because  they said  simply  it's become more difficult to control them. But it's really necessary to do it. They don't have enough flat area to build standard government single story housing like this one. Look at this. Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing  so dense and so messy because there is no storage  nothing  water is leaking  so I thought  we have to make multi story building because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable. So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions. Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi. He asked me to build three story housing on baseball  fields . I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable  within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same  but much more comfortable. Many of the people want to stay here forever. I was very happy to hear that. Now I am working in New Zealand  Christchurch. About    days before the Japanese earthquake happened  also they had a big earthquake  and many Japanese students were also killed  and the most important cathedral of the city  the symbol of Christchurch  was totally destroyed. And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral. So this is under construction. And I'd like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  What I'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects  and that is the neuroscience of sleep. Now  there is a sound    Ah  it worked  A sound that is desperately familiar to most of us  and of course it's the sound of the alarm clock. And what that truly ghastly  awful sound does is stop the single most important behavioral experience that we have  and that's sleep. If you're an average sort of person     percent of your life will be spent asleep  which means that if you live to     then    years will have been spent entirely asleep. Now what that    years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important. And yet  for most of us  we don't give sleep a second thought. We throw it away. We really just don't think about sleep. And so what I'd like to do today is change your views  change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep. And the journey that I want to take you on  we need to start by going back in time.  Enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber.  Any ideas who said that  Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Yes  let me give you a few more quotes.  O sleep  O gentle sleep  nature's soft nurse  how have I frighted thee   Shakespeare again  from    I won't say it    the Scottish play. From the same time   Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.  Extremely prophetic  by Thomas Dekker  another Elizabethan dramatist. But if we jump forward     years  the tone about sleep changes somewhat. This is from Thomas Edison  from the beginning of the   th century   Sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days.  Bang  And if we also jump into the     s  some of you may remember that Margaret Thatcher was reported to have said   Sleep is for wimps.  And of course the infamous    what was his name     the infamous Gordon Gekko from  Wall Street  said   Money never sleeps.  What do we do in the   th century about sleep  Well  of course  we use Thomas Edison's light bulb to invade the night  and we occupied the dark  and in the process of this occupation  we've treated sleep as an illness  almost. We've treated it as an enemy. At most now  I suppose  we tolerate the need for sleep  and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep as an illness that needs some sort of a cure. And our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound. Why is it  Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts  Well  it's because you don't do anything much while you're asleep  it seems. You don't eat. You don't drink. And you don't have sex. Well  most of us anyway. And so  therefore it's    Sorry. It's a complete waste of time  right  Wrong. Actually  sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology  and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it's so very important. So let's move to the brain. Now  here we have a brain. This is donated by a social scientist  and they said they didn't know what it was or indeed  how to use it  so    Sorry. So I borrowed it. I don't think they noticed. OK. The point I'm trying to make is that when you're asleep  this thing doesn't shut down. In fact  some areas of the brain are actually more active during the sleep state than during the wake state. The other thing that's really important about sleep is that it doesn't arise from a single structure within the brain  but is to some extent a network property. If we flip the brain on its back    I love this little bit of spinal cord here    this bit here is the hypothalamus  and right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures  not least the biological clock. The biological clock tells us when it's good to be up  when it's good to be asleep  and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus  the lateral hypothalamus  the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei. All of those combine  and they send projections down to the brain stem here. The brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex  this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here  with neurotransmitters that keep us awake and essentially provide us with our consciousness. So sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions within the brain  and essentially  sleep is turned on and off as a result of a range of interactions in here. OK. So where have we got to  We've said that sleep is complicated and it takes    years of our life. But what I haven't explained is what sleep is about. So why do we sleep  And it won't surprise any of you that  of course  as scientists  we don't have a consensus. There are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep  and I'm going to outline three of those. The first is sort of the restoration idea  and it's somewhat intuitive. Essentially  all the stuff we've burned up during the day  we restore  we replace  we rebuild during the night. And indeed  as an explanation  it goes back to Aristotle  so that's what          years ago. It's gone in and out of fashion. It's fashionable at the moment because what's been shown is that within the brain  a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep  and those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways. So there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis. What about energy conservation  Again  perhaps intuitive. You essentially sleep to save calories. Now  when you do the sums  though  it doesn't really pan out. If you compare an individual who has slept at night  or stayed awake and hasn't moved very much  the energy saving of sleeping is about     calories a night. Now  that's the equivalent of a hot dog bun. Now  I would say that a hot dog bun is kind of a meager return for such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep. So I'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea. But the third idea I'm quite attracted to  which is brain processing and memory consolidation. What we know is that  if after you've tried to learn a task  and you sleep deprive individuals  the ability to learn that task is smashed. It's really hugely attenuated. So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important. However  it's not just the laying down of memory and recalling it. What's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep. In fact  it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage. Sleeping at night enhances our creativity. And what seems to be going on is that  in the brain  those neural connections that are important  those synaptic connections that are important  are linked and strengthened  while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important. OK. So we've had three explanations for why we might sleep  and I think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary  and it's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons. But sleep is not an indulgence. It's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually. I think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade from economy to business class  you know  the equivalent of. It's not even an upgrade from economy to first class. The critical thing to realize is that if you don't sleep  you don't fly. Essentially  you never get there. And what's extraordinary about much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleep deprived. So let's now look at sleep deprivation. Huge sectors of society are sleep deprived  and let's look at our sleep o meter. So in the     s  good data suggests that most of us were getting around eight hours of sleep a night. Nowadays  we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night  so we're in the six and a half hours every night league. For teenagers  it's worse  much worse. They need nine hours for full brain performance  and many of them  on a school night  are only getting five hours of sleep. It's simply not enough. If we think about other sectors of society    the aged  if you are aged  then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted  and many sleep  again  less than five hours a night. Shift work. Shift work is extraordinary  perhaps    percent of the working population  and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night. It's locked onto the same light dark cycle as the rest of us. So when the poor old shift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day  desperately tired  the body clock is saying   Wake up. This is the time to be awake.  So the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor  again in that sort of five hour region. And then  of course  tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag. So who here has jet lag  Well  my goodness gracious. Well  thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep  because that's what your brain is craving. One of the things that the brain does is indulge in micro sleeps  this involuntary falling asleep  and you have essentially no control over it. Now  micro sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing  but they can also be deadly. It's been estimated that    percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life  and in the US  the statistics are pretty good          accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness  loss of vigilance  and falling asleep    a hundred thousand a year. It's extraordinary. At another level of terror  we dip into the tragic accidents at Chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle Challenger  which was so tragically lost. And in the investigations that followed those disasters  poor judgment as a result of extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk of those disasters. When you're tired and you lack sleep  you have poor memory  you have poor creativity  you have increased impulsiveness  and you have overall poor judgment. But my friends  it's so much worse than that. If you are a tired brain  the brain is craving things to wake it up. So drugs  stimulants. Caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across much of the Western world. Much of the day is fueled by caffeine  and if you're a really naughty tired brain  nicotine. Of course  you're fueling the waking state with these stimulants  and then  of course  it gets to    o'clock at night  and the brain says to itself   Actually  I need to be asleep fairly shortly. What do we do about that when I'm feeling completely wired   Well  of course  you then resort to alcohol. Now alcohol  short term  you know  once or twice  to use to mildly sedate you  can be very useful. It can actually ease the sleep transition. But what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep. A biological mimic for sleep  it sedates you. So it actually harms some of the neural processing that's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall. So it's a short term acute measure  but for goodness sake  don't become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night. Another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain. If you sleep around about five hours or less every night  then you have a    percent likelihood of being obese. What's the connection here  Well  sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin  the hunger hormone. Ghrelin is released. It gets to the brain. The brain says   I need carbohydrates   and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars. So there's a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain  stress. Tired people are massively stressed. And one of the things of stress  of course  is loss of memory  which is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of. But stress is so much more. So  if you're acutely stressed  not a great problem  but it's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that's the problem. Sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity. And so  tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection  and there's some very good studies showing that shift workers  for example  have higher rates of cancer. Increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation. Glucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature and essentially you become glucose intolerant. Therefore  diabetes  . Stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure. So there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss that are more than just a mildly impaired brain  which is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides. So at this point in the talk  this is a nice time to think   Well  do you think on the whole I'm getting enough sleep   So a quick show of hands. Who feels that they're getting enough sleep here  Oh. Well  that's pretty impressive. Good. We'll talk more about that later  about what are your tips. So most of us  of course  ask the question   How do I know whether I'm getting enough sleep   Well  it's not rocket science. If you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning  if you are taking a long time to get up  if you need lots of stimulants  if you're grumpy  if you're irritable  if you're told by your work colleagues that you're looking tired and irritable  chances are you are sleep deprived. Listen to them. Listen to yourself. What do you do  Well    and this is slightly offensive    sleep for dummies. Make your bedroom a haven for sleep. The first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can  and also make it slightly cool. Very important. Actually  reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed. Light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep. What's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed  We stand in a massively lit bathroom  looking into the mirror cleaning our teeth. It's the worst thing we can possibly do before we go to sleep. Turn off those mobile phones. Turn off those computers. Turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain. Try not to drink caffeine too late in the day  ideally not after lunch. Now  we've set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed  but light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological clock to the light dark cycle. So seek out morning light. Basically  listen to yourself. Wind down. Do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the honey heavy dew of slumber. OK. That's some facts. What about some myths  Teenagers are lazy. No. Poor things. They have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late  so give them a break. We need eight hours of sleep a night. That's an average. Some people need more. Some people need less. And what you need to do is listen to your body. Do you need that much or do you need more  Simple as that. Old people need less sleep. Not true. The sleep demands of the aged do not go down. Essentially  sleep fragments and becomes less robust  but sleep requirements do not go down. And the fourth myth is early to bed  early to rise makes a man healthy  wealthy and wise. Well  that's wrong at so many different levels. There is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all. There's no difference in socioeconomic status. In my experience  the only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug. OK. So for the last few minutes  what I want to do is change gears and talk about some really new  breaking areas of neuroscience  which is the association between mental health  mental illness and sleep disruption. We've known for     years that in severe mental illness  there is always  always sleep disruption  but it's been largely ignored. In the     s  when people started to think about this again  they said   Yes  well  of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia  because they're on antipsychotics. It's the antipsychotics causing the sleep problems   ignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously  sleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics. So what's going on  Several groups are studying conditions like depression  schizophrenia and bipolar and what's going on in terms of sleep disruption. We have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia  and the data were quite extraordinary. In those individuals with schizophrenia  much of the time  they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day. Other groups showed no    hour patterns whatsoever    their sleep was absolutely smashed. And some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light dark cycle. They were getting up later and later and later and later each night. It was smashed. So what's going on  And the really exciting news is that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated  but they are physically linked within the brain. The neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep  give you normal sleep  and those that give you normal mental health  are overlapping. And what's the evidence for that  Well  genes that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal sleep  when mutated  when changed  also predispose individuals to mental health problems. And last year  we published a study which showed that a gene that's been linked to schizophrenia  when mutated  also smashes the sleep. So we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems. Other work flowed from these studies. The first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types of mental illness  and we've shown that in those young individuals who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder  they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical diagnosis of bipolar. The other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate  make worse  the mental illness state. My colleague Dan Freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by    percent. So what have we got  We've got  in these connections  some really exciting things. In terms of the neuroscience  by understanding these two systems  we're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain. The second area is that if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal  then we have the chance of going in. If we know these individuals are vulnerable  early intervention then becomes possible. And the third  which I think is the most exciting  is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target. Stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable  we can certainly make them healthier  but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness. So let me just finish. What I started by saying is  Take sleep seriously. Our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre industrial age  when we were almost wrapped in a duvet. We used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep. And this isn't some sort of crystal waving nonsense. This is a pragmatic response to good health. If you have good sleep  it increases your concentration  attention  decision making  creativity  social skills  health. If you get sleep  it reduces your mood changes  your stress  your levels of anger  your impulsivity  and your tendency to drink and take drugs. And we finished by saying that an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep is really informing the way we think about some of the causes of mental illness  and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions. Jim Butcher  the fantasy writer  said   Sleep is God. Go worship.  And I can only recommend that you do the same. Thank you for your attention. Steve Ramirez  My first year of grad school  I found myself in my bedroom eating lots of Ben   Jerry's watching some trashy TV and maybe  maybe listening to Taylor Swift. I had just gone through a breakup. So for the longest time  all I would do is recall the memory of this person over and over again  wishing that I could get rid of that gut wrenching  visceral  blah  feeling. Now  as it turns out  I'm a neuroscientist  so I knew that the memory of that person and the awful  emotional undertones that color in that memory  are largely mediated by separate brain systems. And so I thought  what if we could go into the brain and edit out that nauseating feeling but while keeping the memory of that person intact  Then I realized  maybe that's a little bit lofty for now. So what if we could start off by going into the brain and just finding a single memory to begin with  Could we jump start that memory back to life  maybe even play with the contents of that memory  All that said  there is one person in the entire world right now that I really hope is not watching this talk. So there is a catch. There is a catch. These ideas probably remind you of  Total Recall    Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind   or of  Inception.  But the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab. Xu Liu  Test mice. As neuroscientists  we work in the lab with mice trying to understand how memory works. And today  we hope to convince you that now we are actually able to activate a memory in the brain at the speed of light. To do this  there's only two simple steps to follow. First  you find and label a memory in the brain  and then you activate it with a switch. As simple as that. SR  Are you convinced  So  turns out finding a memory in the brain isn't all that easy. XL  Indeed. This is way more difficult than  let's say  finding a needle in a haystack  because at least  you know  the needle is still something you can physically put your fingers on. But memory is not. And also  there's way more cells in your brain than the number of straws in a typical haystack. So yeah  this task does seem to be daunting. But luckily  we got help from the brain itself. It turned out that all we need to do is basically to let the brain form a memory  and then the brain will tell us which cells are involved in that particular memory. SR  So what was going on in my brain while I was recalling the memory of an ex  If you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now  you would see that there was an amazing number of brain regions that were active while recalling that memory. Now one brain region that would be robustly active in particular is called the hippocampus  which for decades has been implicated in processing the kinds of memories that we hold near and dear  which also makes it an ideal target to go into and to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory. XL  When you zoom in into the hippocampus  of course you will see lots of cells  but we are able to find which cells are involved in a particular memory  because whenever a cell is active  like when it's forming a memory  it will also leave a footprint that will later allow us to know these cells are recently active. SR  So the same way that building lights at night let you know that somebody's probably working there at any given moment  in a very real sense  there are biological sensors within a cell that are turned on only when that cell was just working. They're sort of biological windows that light up to let us know that that cell was just active. XL  So we clipped part of this sensor  and attached that to a switch to control the cells  and we packed this switch into an engineered virus and injected that into the brain of the mice. So whenever a memory is being formed  any active cells for that memory will also have this switch installed. SR  So here is what the hippocampus looks like after forming a fear memory  for example. The sea of blue that you see here are densely packed brain cells  but the green brain cells  the green brain cells are the ones that are holding on to a specific fear memory. So you are looking at the crystallization of the fleeting formation of fear. You're actually looking at the cross section of a memory right now. XL  Now  for the switch we have been talking about  ideally  the switch has to act really fast. It shouldn't take minutes or hours to work. It should act at the speed of the brain  in milliseconds. SR  So what do you think  Xu  Could we use  let's say  pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells  XL  Nah. Drugs are pretty messy. They spread everywhere. And also it takes them forever to act on cells. So it will not allow us to control a memory in real time. So Steve  how about let's zap the brain with electricity  SR  So electricity is pretty fast  but we probably wouldn't be able to target it to just the specific cells that hold onto a memory  and we'd probably fry the brain. XL  Oh. That's true. So it looks like  hmm  indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light. SR  So it just so happens that light travels at the speed of light. So maybe we could activate or inactive memories by just using light    XL  That's pretty fast. SR     and because normally brain cells don't respond to pulses of light  so those that would respond to pulses of light are those that contain a light sensitive switch. Now to do that  first we need to trick brain cells to respond to laser beams. XL  Yep. You heard it right. We are trying to shoot lasers into the brain. SR  And the technique that lets us do that is optogenetics. Optogenetics gave us this light switch that we can use to turn brain cells on or off  and the name of that switch is channelrhodopsin  seen here as these green dots attached to this brain cell. You can think of channelrhodopsin as a sort of light sensitive switch that can be artificially installed in brain cells so that now we can use that switch to activate or inactivate the brain cell simply by clicking it  and in this case we click it on with pulses of light. XL  So we attach this light sensitive switch of channelrhodopsin to the sensor we've been talking about and inject this into the brain. So whenever a memory is being formed  any active cell for that particular memory will also have this light sensitive switch installed in it so that we can control these cells by the flipping of a laser just like this one you see. SR  So let's put all of this to the test now. What we can do is we can take our mice and then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here  and then we can give them a very mild foot shock so that they form a fear memory of this box. They learn that something bad happened here. Now with our system  the cells that are active in the hippocampus in the making of this memory  only those cells will now contain channelrhodopsin. XL  When you are as small as a mouse  it feels as if the whole world is trying to get you. So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected. Whenever a mouse is in fear  it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box  trying to not move any part of its body  and this posture is called freezing. So if a mouse remembers that something bad happened in this box  and when we put them back into the same box  it will basically show freezing because it doesn't want to be detected by any potential threats in this box. SR  So you can think of freezing as  you're walking down the street minding your own business  and then out of nowhere you almost run into an ex girlfriend or ex boyfriend  and now those terrifying two seconds where you start thinking   What do I do  Do I say hi  Do I shake their hand  Do I turn around and run away  Do I sit here and pretend like I don't exist   Those kinds of fleeting thoughts that physically incapacitate you  that temporarily give you that deer in headlights look. XL  However  if you put the mouse in a completely different new box  like the next one  it will not be afraid of this box because there's no reason that it will be afraid of this new environment. But what if we put the mouse in this new box but at the same time  we activate the fear memory using lasers just like we did before  Are we going to bring back the fear memory for the first box into this completely new environment  SR  All right  and here's the million dollar experiment. Now to bring back to life the memory of that day  I remember that the Red Sox had just won  it was a green spring day  perfect for going up and down the river and then maybe going to the North End to get some cannolis   justsaying. Now Xu and I  on the other hand  were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen. We were looking at this mouse here trying to activate a memory for the first time using our technique. XL  And this is what we saw. When we first put the mouse into this box  it's exploring  sniffing around  walking around  minding its own business  because actually by nature  mice are pretty curious animals. They want to know  what's going on in this new box  It's interesting. But the moment we turned on the laser  like you see now  all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode. It stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body. Clearly it's freezing. So indeed  it looks like we are able to bring back the fear memory for the first box in this completely new environment. While watching this  Steve and I are as shocked as the mouse itself. So after the experiment  the two of us just left the room without saying anything. After a kind of long  awkward period of time  Steve broke the silence. SR   Did that just work   XL   Yes   I said.  Indeed it worked   We're really excited about this. And then we published our findings in the journal Nature. Ever since the publication of our work  we've been receiving numerous comments from all over the Internet. Maybe we can take a look at some of those.   OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come  virtual reality  neural manipulation  visual dream emulation... neural coding  'writing and re writing of memories'  mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome   SR  So the first thing that you'll notice is that people have really strong opinions about this kind of work. Now I happen to completely agree with the optimism of this first quote  because on a scale of zero to Morgan Freeman's voice  it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that I've heard come our way. But as you'll see  it's not the only opinion that's out there.   This scares the hell out of me... What if they could do that easily in humans in a couple of years   OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOMED   XL  Indeed  if we take a look at the second one  I think we can all agree that it's  meh  probably not as positive. But this also reminds us that  although we are still working with mice  it's probably a good idea to start thinking and discussing about the possible ethical ramifications of memory control. SR  Now  in the spirit of the third quote  we want to tell you about a recent project that we've been working on in lab that we've called Project Inception.   They should make a movie about this. Where they plant ideas into peoples minds  so they can control them for their own personal gain. We'll call it  Inception.   So we reasoned that now that we can reactivate a memory  what if we do so but then begin to tinker with that memory  Could we possibly even turn it into a false memory  XL  So all memory is sophisticated and dynamic  but if just for simplicity  let's imagine memory as a movie clip. So far what we've told you is basically we can control this  play  button of the clip so that we can play this video clip any time  anywhere. But is there a possibility that we can actually get inside the brain and edit this movie clip so that we can make it different from the original  Yes we can. Turned out that all we need to do is basically reactivate a memory using lasers just like we did before  but at the same time  if we present new information and allow this new information to incorporate into this old memory  this will change the memory. It's sort of like making a remix tape. SR  So how do we do this  Rather than finding a fear memory in the brain  we can start by taking our animals  and let's say we put them in a blue box like this blue box here and we find the brain cells that represent that blue box and we trick them to respond to pulses of light exactly like we had said before. Now the next day  we can take our animals and place them in a red box that they've never experienced before. We can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box. So what would happen here if  while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box  we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks  So here we're trying to artificially make an association between the memory of the blue box and the foot shocks themselves. We're just trying to connect the two. So to test if we had done so  we can take our animals once again and place them back in the blue box. Again  we had just reactivated the memory of the blue box while the animal got a couple of mild foot shocks  and now the animal suddenly freezes. It's as though it's recalling being mildly shocked in this environment even though that never actually happened. So it formed a false memory  because it's falsely fearing an environment where  technically speaking  nothing bad actually happened to it. XL  So  so far we are only talking about this light controlled  on  switch. In fact  we also have a light controlled  off  switch  and it's very easy to imagine that by installing this light controlled  off  switch  we can also turn off a memory  any time  anywhere. So everything we've been talking about today is based on this philosophically charged principle of neuroscience that the mind  with its seemingly mysterious properties  is actually made of physical stuff that we can tinker with. SR  And for me personally  I see a world where we can reactivate any kind of memory that we'd like. I also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories. Now  I even see a world where editing memories is something of a reality  because we're living in a time where it's possible to pluck questions from the tree of science fiction and to ground them in experimental reality. XL  Nowadays  people in the lab and people in other groups all over the world are using similar methods to activate or edit memories  whether that's old or new  positive or negative  all sorts of memories so that we can understand how memory works. SR  For example  one group in our lab was able to find the brain cells that make up a fear memory and converted them into a pleasurable memory  just like that. That's exactly what I mean about editing these kinds of processes. Now one dude in lab was even able to reactivate memories of female mice in male mice  which rumor has it is a pleasurable experience. XL  Indeed  we are living in a very exciting moment where science doesn't have any arbitrary speed limits but is only bound by our own imagination. SR  And finally  what do we make of all this  How do we push this technology forward  These are the questions that should not remain just inside the lab  and so one goal of today's talk was to bring everybody up to speed with the kind of stuff that's possible in modern neuroscience  but now  just as importantly  to actively engage everybody in this conversation. So let's think together as a team about what this all means and where we can and should go from here  because Xu and I think we all have some really big decisions ahead of us. Thank you. XL  Thank you. I come from Lebanon  and I believe that running can change the world. I know what I have just said is simply not obvious. You know  Lebanon as a country has been once destroyed by a long and bloody civil war. Honestly  I don't know why they call it civil war when there is nothing civil about it. With Syria to the north  Israel and Palestine to the south  and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable. For years  the country has been divided between politics and religion. However  for one day a year  we truly stand united  and that's when the marathon takes place. I used to be a marathon runner. Long distance running was not only good for my well being but it helped me meditate and dream big. So the longer distances I ran  the bigger my dreams became. Until one fateful morning  and while training  I was hit by a bus. I nearly died  was in a coma  stayed at the hospital for two years  and underwent    surgeries to be able to walk again. As soon as I came out of my coma  I realized that I was no longer the same runner I used to be  so I decided  if I couldn't run myself  I wanted to make sure that others could. So out of my hospital bed  I asked my husband to start taking notes  and a few months later  the marathon was born. Organizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident may sound strange  but at that time  even during my most vulnerable condition  I needed to dream big. I needed something to take me out of my pain  an objective to look forward to. I didn't want to pity myself  nor to be pitied  and I thought by organizing such a marathon  I'll be able to pay back to my community  build bridges with the outside world  and invite runners to come to Lebanon and run under the umbrella of peace. Organizing a marathon in Lebanon is definitely not like organizing one in New York. How do you introduce the concept of running to a nation that is constantly at the brink of war  How do you ask those who were once fighting and killing each other to come together and run next to each other  More than that  how do you convince people to run a distance of   .  miles at a time they were not even familiar with the word  marathon   So we had to start from scratch. For almost two years  we went all over the country and even visited remote villages. I personally met with people from all walks of life    mayors  NGOs  schoolchildren  politicians  militiamen  people from mosques  churches  the president of the country  even housewives. I learned one thing  When you walk the talk  people believe you. Many were touched by my personal story  and they shared their stories in return. It was honesty and transparency that brought us together. We spoke one common language to each other  and that was from one human to another. Once that trust was built  everybody wanted to be part of the marathon to show the world the true colors of Lebanon and the Lebanese and their desire to live in peace and harmony. In October       over       runners from    different nationalities came to the start line  all determined  and when the gunfire went off  this time it was a signal to run in harmony  for a change. The marathon grew. So did our political problems. But for every disaster we had  the marathon found ways to bring people together. In       our prime minister was assassinated  and the country came to a complete standstill  so we organized a five kilometer United We Run campaign. Over        people came to the start line  all wearing white T shirts with no political slogans. That was a turning point for the marathon  where people started looking at it as a platform for peace and unity. Between      up to       our country  Lebanon  went through unstable years  invasions  and more assassinations that brought us close to a civil war. The country was divided again  so much that our parliament resigned  we had no president for a year  and no prime minister. But we did have a marathon. So through the marathon  we learned that political problems can be overcome. When the opposition party decided to shut down part of the city center  we negotiated alternative routes. Government protesters became sideline cheerleaders. They even hosted juice stations. You know  the marathon has really become one of its kind. It gained credibility from both the Lebanese and the international community. Last November       over        runners from    different nationalities came to the start line  but this time  they challenged a very stormy and rainy weather. The streets were flooded  but people didn't want to miss out on the opportunity of being part of such a national day. BMA has expanded. We include everyone  the young  the elderly  the disabled  the mentally challenged  the blind  the elite  the amateur runners  even moms with their babies. Themes have included runs for the environment  breast cancer  for the love of Lebanon  for peace  or just simply to run. The first annual all women and girls race for empowerment  which is one of its kind in the region  has just taken place only a few weeks ago  with       women  including the first lady  and this is only the beginning. Thank you. BMA has supported charities and volunteers who have helped reshape Lebanon  raising funds for their causes and encouraging others to give. The culture of giving and doing good has become contagious. Stereotypes have been broken. Change makers and future leaders have been created. I believe these are the building blocks for future peace. BMA has become such a respected event in the region that government officials in the region  like Iraq  Egypt and Syria  have asked the organization to help them structure a similar sporting event. We are now one of the largest running events in the Middle East  but most importantly  it is a platform for hope and cooperation in an ever fragile and unstable part of the world. From Boston to Beirut  we stand as one. After    years in Lebanon  from national marathons or from national events to smaller regional races  we've seen that people want to run for a better future. After all  peacemaking is not a sprint. It is more of a marathon. Thank you.
