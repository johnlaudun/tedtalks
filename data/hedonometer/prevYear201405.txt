I'm not sure that every person here is familiar with my pictures. I want to start to show just a few pictures to you  and after I'll speak. I must speak to you a little bit of my history  because we'll be speaking on this during my speech here. I was born in      in Brazil  in the times that Brazil was not yet a market economy. I was born on a farm  a farm that was more than    percent rainforest  still . A marvelous place. I lived with incredible birds  incredible animals  I swam in our small rivers with our caimans. It was about    families that lived on this farm  and everything that we produced on this farm  we consumed. Very few things went to the market. Once a year  the only thing that went to the market was the cattle that we produced  and we made trips of about    days to reach the slaughterhouse  bringing thousands of head of cattle  and about    days traveling back to reach our farm again. When I was    years old  it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger    much bigger    where I did the second part of secondary school. There I learned different things. Brazil was starting to urbanize  industrialize  and I knew the politics. I became a little bit radical  I was a member of leftist parties  and I became an activist. I  went to  university to become an economist. I  did  a master's degree in economics. And the most important thing in my life also happened in this time. I met an incredible girl who became my lifelong best friend  and my associate in everything that I have done till now  my wife  L lia Wanick Salgado. Brazil radicalized very strongly. We fought very hard against the dictatorship  in a moment it was necessary to us  Either go into clandestinity with weapons in hand  or leave Brazil. We were too young  and our organization thought it was better for us to go out  and we went to France  where I did a PhD in economics  L ila became an architect. I worked after for an investment bank. We made a lot of trips  financed development  economic projects in Africa with the World Bank. And one day photography made a total invasion in my life. I became a photographer  abandoned everything and became a photographer  and I started to do the photography that was important for me. Many people tell me that you are a photojournalist  that you are an anthropologist photographer  that you are an activist photographer. But I did much more than that. I put photography as my life. I lived totally inside photography doing long term projects  and I want to show you just a few pictures of    again  you'll see inside the social projects  that I went to  I published many books on these photographs  but I'll just show you a few ones now. In the '  s  from      to       I photographed a story called Migrations. It became a book. It became a show. But during the time that I was photographing this  I lived through a very hard moment in my life  mostly in Rwanda. I saw in Rwanda total brutality. I saw deaths by thousands per day. I lost my faith in our species. I didn't believe that it was possible for us to live any longer  and I started to be attacked by my own Staphylococcus. I started to have infection everywhere. When I made love with my wife  I had no sperm that came out of me  I had blood. I went to see a friend's doctor in Paris  told him that I was completely sick. He made a long examination  and told me   Sebastian  you are not sick  your prostate is perfect. What happened is  you saw so many deaths that you are dying. You must stop. Stop. You must stop because on the contrary  you will be dead.  And I made the decision to stop. I was really upset with photography  with everything in the world  and I made the decision to go back to where I was born. It was a big coincidence. It was the moment that my parents became very old. I have seven sisters. I'm one of the only men in my family  and they made together the decision to transfer this land to L ila and myself. When we received this land  this land was as dead as I was. When I was a kid  it was more than    percent rainforest. When we received the land  it was less than half a percent rainforest  as in all my region. To build development  Brazilian development  we destroyed a lot of our forest. As you did here in the United States  or you did in India  everywhere in this planet. To build our development  we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything. This farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds  and we didn't know how to deal with these. And L ila came up with an incredible idea  a crazy idea. She said  why don't you put back the rainforest that was here before  You say that you were born in paradise. Let's build the paradise again. And I went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to prepare a project for us  and we started. We started to plant  and this first year we lost a lot of trees  second year less  and slowly  slowly this dead land started to be born again. We started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees  only local species  only native species  where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed  and the life started to come back in an incredible way. It was necessary for us to transform our land into a national park. We transformed. We gave this land back to nature. It became a national park. We created an institution called Instituto Terra  and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere. Here in Los Angeles  in the Bay Area in San Francisco  it became tax deductible in the United States. We raised money in Spain  in Italy  a lot in Brazil. We worked with a lot of companies in Brazil that put money into this project  the government. And the life started to come  and I had a big wish to come back to photography  to photograph again. And this time  my wish was not to photograph anymore just one animal that I had photographed all my life  us. I wished to photograph the other animals  to photograph the landscapes  to photograph us  but us from the beginning  the time we lived in equilibrium with nature. And I went. I started in the beginning of       and I finished at the end of     . We created an incredible amount of pictures  and the result    L lia did the design of all my books  the design of all my shows. She is the creator of the shows. And what we want with these pictures is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet and what we must hold on this planet if we want to live  to have some equilibrium in our life. And I wanted to see us when we used  yes  our instruments in stone. We exist yet. I was last week at the Brazilian National Indian Foundation  and only in the Amazon we have about     groups of Indians that are not contacted yet. We must protect the forest in this sense. And with these pictures  I hope that we can create information  a system of information. We tried to do a new presentation of the planet  and I want to show you now just a few pictures of this project  please. Well  this    Applause    Thank you. Thank you very much. This is what we must fight hard to hold like it is now. But there is another part that we must together rebuild  to build our societies  our modern family of societies  we are at a point where we cannot go back. But we create an incredible contradiction. To build all this  we destroy a lot. Our forest in Brazil  that antique forest that was the size of California  is destroyed today    percent. Here  on the West Coast  you've destroyed your forest. Around here  no  The redwood forests are gone. Gone very fast  disappeared. Coming the other day from Atlanta  here  two days ago  I was flying over deserts that we made  we provoked with our own hands. India has no more trees. Spain has no more trees. And we must rebuild these forests. That is the essence of our life  these forests. We need to breathe. The only factory capable to transform CO  into oxygen  are the forests. The only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing  always  even if we reduce them  everything that we do  we produce CO   are the trees. I put the question    three or four weeks ago  we saw in the newspapers millions of fish that die in Norway. A lack of oxygen in the water. I put to myself the question  if for a moment  we will not lack oxygen for all animal species  ours included    that would be very complicated for us. For the water system  the trees are essential. I'll give you a small example that you'll understand very easily. You happy people that have a lot of hair on your head  if you take a shower  it takes you two or three hours to dry your hair if you don't use a dryer machine. Me  one minute  it's dry. The same with the trees. The trees are the hair of our planet. When you have rain in a place that has no trees  in just a few minutes  the water arrives in the stream  brings soil  destroying our water source  destroying the rivers  and no humidity to retain. When you have trees  the root system holds the water. All the branches of the trees  the leaves that come down create a humid area  and they take months and months under the water  go to the rivers  and maintain our source  maintain our rivers. This is the most important thing  when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life. I want to show you now  to finish  just a few pictures that for me are very important in that direction. You remember that I told you  when I received the farm from my parents that was my paradise  that was the farm. Land completely destroyed  the erosion there  the land had dried. But you can see in this picture  we were starting to construct an educational center that became quite a large environmental center in Brazil. But you see a lot of small spots in this picture. In each point of those spots  we had planted a tree. There are thousands of trees. Now I'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point two months ago. I told you in the beginning that it was necessary for us to plant about  .  million trees of about     different species in order to rebuild the ecosystem. And I'll show you the last picture. We are with two million trees in the ground now. We are doing the sequestration of about         tons of carbon with these trees. My friends  it's very easy to do. We did it  no  By an accident that happened to me  we went back  we built an ecosystem. We here inside the room  I believe that we have the same concern  and the model that we created in Brazil  we can transplant it here. We can apply it everywhere around the world  no  And I believe that we can do it together. Thank you very much. All right  so let's take four subjects that obviously go together  big data  tattoos  immortality and the Greeks. Right  Now  the issue about tattoos is that  without a word  tattoos really do shout.  Beautiful   Intriguing  So you don't have to say a lot.  Allegiance   Very intimate   Serious mistakes  And tattoos tell you a lot of stories. If I can ask an indiscreet question  how many of you have tattoos  A few  but not most. What happens if Facebook  Google  Twitter  LinkedIn  cell phones  GPS  Foursquare  Yelp  Travel Advisor  all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos  And what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would  What's ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are Tweeting  blogging  following you  watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself. And electronic tattoos also shout. And as you're thinking of the consequences of that  it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff  among other things  because it's not just the electronic tattoos  it's facial recognition that's getting really good. So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names  although  again  sometimes it does make mistakes.  Laughter  But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this  take a picture  say  of this guy right here  get the name  and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody  because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos. And so there's companies like face.com that now have about    billion faces online. Here's what happened to this company.  Company sold to Facebook  June         ...  There are other companies that will place a camera like this   this has nothing to do with Facebook   they take your picture  they tie it to the social media  they figure out you really like to wear black dresses  so maybe the person in the store comes up and says   Hey  we've got five black dresses that would just look great on you.  So what if Andy was wrong  Here's Andy's theory.  In the future  everybody will be world famous for    minutes.  What if we flip this  What if you're only going to be anonymous for    minutes   Laughter  Well  then  because of electronic tattoos  maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality  because these tattoos will live far longer than our bodies will. And if that's true  then what we want to do is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks and one lesson from a Latin American. Why the Greeks  Well  the Greeks thought about what happens when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time. So lesson number one  Sisyphus. Remember  He did a horrible thing  condemned for all time to roll this rock up  it would roll back down  roll back up  roll back down. It's a little like your reputation. Once you get that electronic tattoo  you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time  so as you go through this stuff  just be careful what you post. Myth number two  Orpheus  wonderful guy  charming to be around  great partier  great singer  loses his beloved  charms his way into the underworld  only person to charm his way into the underworld  charms the gods of the underworld  they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they're out. So he's walking out and walking out and walking out and he just can't resist. He looks at her  loses her forever. With all this data out here  it might be a good idea not to look too far into the past of those you love. Lesson number three  Atalanta. Greatest runner. She would challenge anybody. If you won  she would marry you. If you lost  you died. How did Hippomenes beat her  Well  he had all these wonderful little golden apples  and she'd run ahead  and he'd roll a little golden apple. She'd run ahead  and he'd roll a little golden apple. She kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race. Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them or tweet about them or send a late night message. And then  of course  there's Narcissus. Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus. But as you're thinking about Narcissus  just don't fall in love with your own reflection. Last lesson  from a Latin American  This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges. When he was threatened by the thugs of the Argentine military junta  he came back and said   Oh  come on  how else can you threaten  other than with death   The interesting thing  the original thing  would be to threaten somebody with immortality. And that  of course  is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos. Thank you. I have spent my entire life either at the schoolhouse  on the way to the schoolhouse  or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse. Both my parents were educators  my maternal grandparents were educators  and for the past    years  I've done the same thing. And so  needless to say  over those years I've had a chance to look at education reform from a lot of perspectives. Some of those reforms have been good. Some of them have been not so good. And we know why kids drop out. We know why kids don't learn. It's either poverty  low attendance  negative peer influences... We know why. But one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection. Relationships. James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship. George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships. Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult. For years  I have watched people teach. I have looked at the best and I've looked at some of the worst. A colleague said to me one time   They don't pay me to like the kids. They pay me to teach a lesson. The kids should learn it. I should teach it  they should learn it  Case closed.  Well  I said to her   You know  kids don't learn from people they don't like.  She said   That's just a bunch of hooey.  And I said to her   Well  your year is going to be long and arduous  dear.  Needless to say  it was. Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship  or you don't. I think Stephen Covey had the right idea. He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things  like seeking first to understand  as opposed to being understood. Simple things  like apologizing. You ever thought about that  Tell a kid you're sorry  they're in shock. I taught a lesson once on ratios. I'm not real good with math  but I was working on it. And I got back and looked at that teacher edition. I'd taught the whole lesson wrong. So I came back to class the next day and I said   Look  guys  I need to apologize. I taught the whole lesson wrong. I'm so sorry.  They said   That's okay  Ms. Pierson. You were so excited  we just let you go.  I have had classes that were so low  so academically deficient  that I cried. I wondered   How am I going to take this group  in nine months  from where they are to where they need to be  And it was difficult  it was awfully hard. How do I raise the self esteem of a child and his academic achievement at the same time  One year I came up with a bright idea. I told all my students   You were chosen to be in my class because I am the best teacher and you are the best students  they put us all together so we could show everybody else how to do it.  One of the students said   Really   I said   Really. We have to show the other classes how to do it  so when we walk down the hall  people will notice us  so you can't make noise. You just have to strut.  And I gave them a saying to say   I am somebody. I was somebody when I came. I'll be a better somebody when I leave. I am powerful  and I am strong. I deserve the education that I get here. I have things to do  people to impress  and places to go.  And they said   Yeah   You say it long enough  it starts to be a part of you. I gave a quiz     questions. A student missed   . I put a      on his paper and a big smiley face. He said   Ms. Pierson  is this an F   I said   Yes.  He said   Then why'd you put a smiley face   I said   Because you're on a roll. You got two right. You didn't miss them all.  I said   And when we review this  won't you do better   He said   Yes  ma'am  I can do better.  You see        sucks all the life out of you.      said   I ain't all bad.  For years  I watched my mother take the time at recess to review  go on home visits in the afternoon  buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat  and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good. See  it's hard to teach kids who stink. And kids can be cruel. And so she kept those things in her desk  and years later  after she retired  I watched some of those same kids come through and say to her   You know  Ms. Walker  you made a difference in my life. You made it work for me. You made me feel like I was somebody  when I knew  at the bottom  I wasn't. And I want you to just see what I've become.  And when my mama died two years ago at     there were so many former students at her funeral  it brought tears to my eyes  not because she was gone  but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear. Can we stand to have more relationships  Absolutely. Will you like all your children  Of course not. And you know your toughest kids are never absent. Never. You won't like them all  and the tough ones show up for a reason. It's the connection. It's the relationships. So teachers become great actors and great actresses  and we come to work when we don't feel like it  and we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense  and we teach anyway. We teach anyway  because that's what we do. Teaching and learning should bring joy. How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks  who were not afraid to think  and who had a champion  Every child deserves a champion  an adult who will never give up on them  who understands the power of connection  and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be. Is this job tough  You betcha. Oh God  you betcha. But it is not impossible. We can do this. We're educators. We're born to make a difference. Thank you so much. In this talk today  I want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment. It's a different idea  because usually  when people talk about early childhood programs  they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of former participants  in preschool  they have better K    test scores  better adult earnings. Now that's all very important  but what I want to talk about is what preschool does for state economies and for promoting state economic development. And that's actually crucial because if we're going to get increased investment in early childhood programs  we need to interest state governments in this. The federal government has a lot on its plate  and state governments are going to have to step up. So we have to appeal to them  the legislators in the state government  and turn to something they understand  that they have to promote the economic development of their state economy. Now  by promoting economic development  I don't mean anything magical. All I mean is  is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state's residents. Now  I think it's fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development  they don't generally think first about what they're doing about childcare and early childhood programs. I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs. I've talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues  a lot of legislators about these issues. When legislators and others think about economic development  what they first of all think about are business tax incentives  property tax abatements  job creation tax credits  you know  there are a million of these programs all over the place. So for example  states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants. They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks. Now  those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions  and the way they can make sense is  by creating more and better jobs  they raise employment rates  raise per capita earnings of state residents. So there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that they're paying by paying for these business tax breaks. My argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do exactly the same thing  create more and better jobs  but in a different way. It's a somewhat more indirect way. These programs can promote more and better jobs by  you build it  you invest in high quality preschool  it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around  and  in turn  that higher quality local workforce will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating higher earnings per capita in the local community. Now  let me turn to some numbers on this. Okay. If you look at the research evidence    that's extensive    on how much early childhood programs affect the educational attainment  wages and skills of former participants in preschool as adults  you take those known effects  you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out  and you take research on how much skills drive job creation  you will conclude  from these three separate lines of research  that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs  the per capita earnings of state residents go up by two dollars and    cents  so that's a three to one return. Now you can get much higher returns  of up to    to one  if you include anti crime benefits  if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state  but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers  and it's the states that are going to have to act. So there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development. Now  one objection you often hear  or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it  is  why should I pay more taxes to invest in other people's children  What's in it for me  And the trouble with that objection  it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent. Specifically  the interdependency here is  is that there are huge spillovers of skills    that when other people's children get more skills  that actually increases the prosperity of everyone  including people whose skills don't change. So for example  numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives the growth rate of metropolitan areas  it's not so much low taxes  low cost  low wages  it's the skills of the area. Particularly  the proxy for skills that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area. So when you look  for example  at metropolitan areas such as the Boston area  Minneapolis St. Paul  Silicon Valley  these areas are not doing well economically because they're low cost. I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley. It's not exactly a low cost proposition. They are growing because they have high levels of skills. So when we invest in other people's children  and build up those skills  we increase the overall job growth of a metro area. As another example  if we look at what determines an individual's wages  and we do statistical exploration of that  what determines wages  we know that the individual's wages will depend  in part  on that individual's education  for example whether or not they have a college degree. One of the very interesting facts is that  in addition  we find that even once we hold constant  statistically  the effect of your own education  the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages. So specifically  if you hold constant your education  you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area  you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all. In fact  this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree  the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects. So if someone gets a college degree  their lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount  over         dollars. There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area  and if you add that up    it's a small effect for each person  but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area  you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars. That's actually greater than the direct benefits of the person choosing to get education. Now  what's going on here  What can explain these huge spillover effects of education  Well  let's think about it this way. I can be the most skilled person in the world  but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills  my employer is going to find it more difficult to introduce new technology  new production techniques. So as a result  my employer is going to be less productive. They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages. Even if everyone at my firm has good skills  if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills  my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets. And again  the firm that's less competitive will not be able to pay as good wages  and then  particularly in high tech businesses  they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses. So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm  but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area. So as a result  if we can invest in other people's children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high quality  we not only help those children  we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth. Another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern about people moving out. So  you know  maybe Ohio's thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in Columbus  Ohio  but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will  for some strange reason  decide to move to Ann Arbor  Michigan  and become Wolverines. And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in Ann Arbor  Michigan  and be worried these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes. And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out. Well  the reality is  if you look at the data  Americans aren't as hyper mobile as people sometimes assume. The data is that over    percent of Americans spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in  over    percent. That percentage does not vary much from state to state. It doesn't vary much with the state's economy  whether it's depressed or booming  it doesn't vary much over time. So the reality is  if you invest in kids  they will stay. Or at least  enough of them will stay that it will pay off for your state economy. Okay  so to sum up  there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs  if run in a high quality way  pay off in higher adult skills. There's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy  and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy  and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar  we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy. So in my opinion  the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling. So what are the barriers to getting it done  Well  one obvious barrier is cost. So if you look at what it would cost if every state government invested in universal preschool at age four  full day preschool at age four  the total annual national cost would be roughly    billion dollars. So     billion dollars is a lot of money. On the other hand  if you reflect on that the U.S.'s population is over     million  we're talking about an amount of money that amounts to     dollars per capita. Okay  A hundred dollars per capita  per person  is something that any state government can afford to do. It's just a simple matter of political will to do it. And  of course  as I mentioned  this cost has corresponding benefits. I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three   .    for the state economy  in terms of over    billion in extra earnings. And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something  what we're talking about is that  for the average low income kid  that would increase earnings by about    percent over their whole career  just doing the preschool  not improving K    or anything else after that  not doing anything with college tuition or access  just directly improving preschool  and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle class kids. So this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state's population and produces large and tangible benefits. Now  that's one barrier. I actually think the more profound barrier is the long term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs. So the argument I'm making is  is that we're increasing the quality of our local workforce  and thereby increasing economic development. Obviously if we have a preschool with four year olds  we're not sending these kids out at age five to work in the sweatshops  right  At least I hope not. So we're talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for    or    years  and of course America is notorious for being a short term oriented society. Now one response you can make to this  and I sometimes have done this in talks  is people can talk about  there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedial education costs  there are benefits  parents care about preschool  maybe we'll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool  and I think those are true  but in some sense they're missing the point. Ultimately  this is something we're investing in now for the future. And so what I want to leave you with is what I think is the ultimate question. I mean  I'm an economist  but this is ultimately not an economic question  it's a moral question  Are we willing  as Americans  are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long term future of not only our kids  but our community  Are we still capable of that as a country  And that's something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves. Is that something that you are still invested in  that you still believe in the notion of investment  That is the notion of investment. You sacrifice now for a return later. So I think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is extremely strong. However  the moral and political choice is still up to us  as citizens and as voters. Thank you very much.  Applause  Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher  one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty  the shape and the form of Chinese characters. Ever since then  I was fascinated by this incredible language. But to an outsider  it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China. Over the past few years  I've been wondering if I can break down this wall  so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so. I started thinking about how a new  fast method of learning Chinese might be useful. Since the age of five  I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence. I learned new characters every day during the course of the next    years. Since we only have five minutes  it's better that we have a fast and simpler way. A Chinese scholar would understand        characters. You only need       to understand the basic literacy. The top     will allow you to comprehend    percent of basic literature    enough to read road signs  restaurant menus  to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers. Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works. You are ready  Open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square. You get a mouth. This is a person going for a walk. Person. If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides  as if she was yelling frantically   Help  I'm on fire      This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame  but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you. This is a tree. Tree. This is a mountain. The sun. The moon. The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. I call these eight characters radicals. They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters. A person. If someone walks behind  that is  to follow.  As the old saying goes  two is company  three is a crowd. If a person stretched their arms wide  this person is saying   It was this big.  The person inside the mouth  the person is trapped. He's a prisoner  just like Jonah inside the whale. One tree is a tree. Two trees together  we have the woods. Three trees together  we create the forest. Put a plank underneath the tree  we have the foundation. Put a mouth on the top of the tree  that's  idiot.   Laughter  Easy to remember  since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. Remember fire  Two fires together  I get really hot. Three fires together  that's a lot of flames. Set the fire underneath the two trees  it's burning. For us  the sun is the source of prosperity. Two suns together  prosperous. Three together  that's sparkles. Put the sun and the moon shining together  it's brightness. It also means tomorrow  after a day and a night. The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise. A door. Put a plank inside the door  it's a door bolt. Put a mouth inside the door  asking questions. Knock knock. Is anyone home  This person is sneaking out of a door  escaping  evading. On the left  we have a woman. Two women together  they have an argument. Three women together  be careful  it's adultery. So we have gone through almost    characters. By using this method  the first eight radicals will allow you to build   . The next group of eight characters will build an extra   . So with very little effort  you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters  which is the same as a Chinese eight year old. So after we know the characters  we start building phrases. For example  the mountain and the fire together  we have fire mountain. It's a volcano. We know Japan is the land of the rising sun. This is a sun placed with the origin  because Japan lies to the east of China. So a sun  origin together  we build Japan. A person behind Japan  what do we get  A Japanese person. The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other. In ancient China  that means in exile  because Chinese emperors  they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains. Nowadays  exile has turned into getting out. A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit. This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage. Thank you. Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player  a tennis player  a gymnast or a bridge player. My bridge coach  Sharon Osberg  says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world.  Laughter  Sorry  Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately  there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better  and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get  we were blown away. Until recently  over    percent of teachers just got one word of feedback  Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was  satisfactory   I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best  How would I know what I was doing differently  Today  districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers  but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students  and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well  unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically  and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top   . We're tied for   th with Iceland and Poland. Now  out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading  how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve  Eleven out of   . The U.S. is tied for   th in reading  but we're   rd in science and   st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top  and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer  the province of Shanghai  China. Now  they rank number one across the board  in reading  math and science  and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups  where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask  why is a system like this so important  It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact  there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers  our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like  Well  to find out  our foundation has been working with       teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example  did they ask their students challenging questions  Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea  We also had students fill out surveys with questions like   Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson    Do you learn to correct your mistakes   And what we found is very exciting. First  the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second  teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools  because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started  we're doing a peer review day  okay  A peer review day  and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston  Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about    I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay  so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video  and there is a lot to be learned from that  and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide angle lens. At the beginning of class  I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right  let's take a look at the long one first  okay  Once I'm finished taping  then I put it in my computer  and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down  I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process  and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management  and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works  what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand  and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan  things you cannot convey in a standard  things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty  everybody  have a great weekend. I'll see you later.  Every classroom could look like that  Bill Gates  One day  we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions  you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example  I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable  but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process  if they collect video in their own classrooms  and they pick the lessons they want to submit  a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number  but to put it in perspective  it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback  as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education  find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding  and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one  too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. I teach chemistry. All right  all right. So more than just explosions  chemistry is everywhere. Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over  Some people nodding yes. Recently  I showed this to my students  and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened. The questions and conversations that followed were fascinating. Check out this video that Maddie from my period three class sent me that evening. Now obviously  as Maddie's chemistry teacher  I love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class. But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity took her to a new level. If you look inside that beaker  you might see a candle. Maddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon to a new scenario. You know  questions and curiosity like Maddie's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers  and they transcend all technology or buzzwords in education. But if we place these technologies before student inquiry  we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers  our students' questions. For example  flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time  but if it is the focus of our students' experience  it's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing. But if instead we have the guts to confuse our students  perplex them  and evoke real questions  through those questions  we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction. So    st century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside  the truth is  I've been teaching for    years now  and it took a life threatening situation to snap me out of    years of pseudo teaching and help me realize that student questions are the seeds of real learning  not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information. In May of       at    years old  with a two year old at home and my second child on the way  I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta. This led to open heart surgery. This is the actual real email from my doctor right there. Now  when I got this  I was    press Caps Lock    absolutely freaked out  okay  But I found surprising moments of comfort in the confidence that my surgeon embodied. Where did this guy get this confidence  the audacity of it  So when I asked him  he told me three things. He said first  his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure  about what worked and what didn't work. Second  he embraced  and didn't fear  the messy process of trial and error  the inevitable process of trial and error. And third  through intense reflection  he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure  and then  with a steady hand  he saved my life. Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom  and before I went back into the classroom that fall  I wrote down three rules of my own that I bring to my lesson planning still today. Rule number one  Curiosity comes first. Questions can be windows to great instruction  but not the other way around. Rule number two  Embrace the mess. We're all teachers. We know learning is ugly. And just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section  .  of chapter one of the one that we all skip  okay  trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room    . And rule number three  Practice reflection. What we do is important. It deserves our care  but it also deserves our revision. Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms  As if what we are doing one day will save lives. Our students our worth it. And each case is different. All right. Sorry. The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that out of my system before we move on. So these are my daughters. On the right we have little Emmalou    Southern family. And  on the left  Riley. Now Riley's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here. She's going to be four years old  and anyone who knows a four year old knows that they love to ask   Why   Yeah. Why. I could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything. We all were at that age. But the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers  the ones she has yet to meet. How will they grow this curiosity  You see  I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids  and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms    to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom. But if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry  we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day  and spark their imagination. Thank you very much. So I grew up in East Los Angeles  not even realizing I was poor. My dad was a high ranking gang member who ran the streets. Everyone knew who I was  so I thought I was a pretty big deal  and I was protected  and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail  I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent. She worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean's office  so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class  for whatever reason  who were waiting to be disciplined. Man  her office was packed. So  see  kids like us  we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school  and sometimes we're just not ready to focus. But that doesn't mean that we can't. It just takes a little bit more. Like  I remember one day I found my dad convulsing  foaming at the mouth  OD ing on the bathroom floor. Really  do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list  Not so much. But I really needed a support network  a group of people who were going to help me make sure that I wasn't going to be a victim of my own circumstance  that they were going to push me beyond what I even thought I could do. I needed teachers  in the classroom  every day  who were going to say   You can move beyond that.  And unfortunately  the local junior high was not going to offer that. It was gang infested  huge teacher turnover rate. So my mom said   You're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day.  So for the next two years  that's what I did. I took a school bus to the fancy side of town. And eventually  I ended up at a school where there was a mixture. There were some people who were really gang affiliated  and then there were those of us really trying to make it to high school. Well  trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable. You had to survive. You just had to do things sometimes. So there were a lot of teachers who were like   She's never going to make it. She has an issue with authority. She's not going to go anywhere.  Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause. But then  they were very surprised when I graduated from high school. I was accepted to Pepperdine University  and I came back to the same school that I attended to be a special ed assistant. And then I told them   I want to be a teacher.  And boy  they were like   What  Why  Why would you want to do that   So I began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that I attended  and I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me. And so every year  I share my background with my kids  because they need to know that everyone has a story  everyone has a struggle  and everyone needs help along the way. And I am going to be their help along the way. So as a rookie teacher  I created opportunity. I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before. I was like   You need to go to a hospital  the school nurse  something.  He's like   No  Miss  I'm not going. I need to be in class because I need to graduate.  So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance  but we were going to push forward and keep moving on. And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they're going through  getting to know their families    I wanted that  but I couldn't do it in a school with       kids  and teachers turning over year after year after year. How do you get to build those relationships  So we created a new school. And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media. And we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding  for support. But with that  we were going to gain freedom  freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective  freedom to control the curriculum so that we're not doing lesson  .  on page five  no  and freedom to control a budget  to spend money where it matters  not how a district or a state says you have to do it. We wanted those freedoms. But now  shifting an entire paradigm  it hasn't been an easy journey  nor is it even complete. But we had to do it. Our community deserved a new way of doing things. And as the very first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District  you better believe there was some opposition. And it was out of fear    fear of  well  what if they get it wrong  Yeah  what if we get it wrong  But what if we get it right  And we did. So even though teachers were against it because we employ one year contracts    you can't teach  or you don't want to teach  you don't get to be at my school with my kids. So in our third year  how did we do it  Well  we're making school worth coming to every day. We make our kids feel like they matter to us. We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them  and they use all the technology that they're used to. Laptops  computers  tablets    you name it  they have it. Animation  software  moviemaking software  they have it all. And because we connect it to what they're doing   For example  they made public service announcements for the Cancer Society. These were played in the local trolley system. Teaching elements of persuasion  it doesn't get any more real than that. Our state test scores have gone up more than    points since we've become our own school. But it's taken all stakeholders  working together    teachers and principals on one year contracts  working over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation. And it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say   Know  the district is trying to impose this  but you have the freedom to do otherwise.  And it takes an active parent center who is not only there  showing a presence every day  but who is part of our governance  making decisions for their kids  our kids. Because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live  They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood  a school that they can be proud to say they attend  and a school that the community can be proud of as well  and they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances. Because it's time that kids like me stop being the exception  and we become the norm. Thank you. I'm a little nervous  because my wife Yvonne said to me  she said   Geoff  you watch the TED Talks.  I said   Yes  honey  I love TED Talks.  She said   You know  they're like  really smart  talented      I said   I know  I know.   Laughter  She said   They don't want  like  the angry black man.  So I said   No  I'm gonna be good  Honey  I'm gonna be good. I am.  But I am angry.  Laughter  And the last time I looked  I'm    So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry. This year  there are going to be millions of our children that we're going to needlessly lose  that we could    right now  we could save them all. You saw the quality of the educators who were here. Do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them. I know they could. It is absolutely possible. Why haven't we fixed this  Those of us in education have held on to a business plan that we don't care how many millions of young people fail  we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work  and nobody is getting crazy about it    right     enough to say   Enough is enough.  So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense. You know  I grew up in the inner city  and there were kids who were failing in schools    years ago when I first went to school  and those schools are still lousy today     years later. And you know something about a lousy school  It's not like a bottle of wine. Right   Laughter  Where you say  like  '   was like a good year  right  That's now how this thing    I mean  every single year  it's still the same approach  right  One size fits all  if you get it  fine  and if you don't  tough luck. Just tough luck. Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen  Do not tell me we can't do better than this. Look  you go into a place that's failed kids for    years  and you say   So what's the plan   And they say   We'll  we're going to do what we did last year this year.  What kind of business model is that  Banks used to open and operate between    and  . They operated    to  . They were closed for lunch hour. Now  who can bank between    and    The unemployed. They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks. Who created that business model  Right  And it went on for decades. You know why  Because they didn't care. It wasn't about the customers. It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them. How could you go to the bank when you were at work  It didn't matter. And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset he can't go to the bank. Go find another bank. They all operate the same way. Right  Now  one day  some crazy banker had an idea. Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work. They might like that. What about a Saturday  What about introducing technology  Now look  I'm a technology fan  but I have to admit to you all I'm a little old. So I was a little slow  and I did not trust technology  and when they first came out with those new contraptions  these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money  I was like   There's no way that machine is going to count that money right. I am never using that  right   So technology has changed. Things have changed. Yet not in education. Why  Why is it that when we had rotary phones  when we were having folks being crippled by polio  that we were teaching the same way then that we're doing right now  And if you come up with a plan to change things  people consider you radical. They will say the worst things about you. I said one day  well  look  if the science says    this is science  not me    that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime    You see where they are in June and say  okay  they're there. You look at them in September  they've gone down. You say  whoo  So I heard about that in '   when I was at the Ed School at Harvard. I said   Oh  wow  this is an important study.  Because it suggests we should do something. Every    years they reproduce the same study. It says exactly the same thing  Poor kids lose ground in the summertime. The system decides you can't run schools in the summer. You know  I always wonder  who makes up those rules  For years I went to    Look  I went the Harvard Ed School. I thought I knew something. They said it was the agrarian calendar  and people had   but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense. I never got that. I never got that  because anyone knows if you farm  you don't plant crops in July and August. You plant them in the spring. So who came up with this idea  Who owns it  Why did we ever do it  Well it just turns out in the     s we did have  schools were open all year. They were open all year  because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day. They didn't have any place for their kids to go. It was a perfect place to have schools. So this is not something that is ordained from the education gods. So why don't we  Why don't we  Because our business has refused to use science. Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying   Look  this works  right  We can do this.  How many places in America are going to change  None. None. Okay  yeah  there are two. All right  Yes  there'll be some place  because some folks will do the right thing. As a profession  we have to stop this. The science is clear. Here's what we know. We know that the problem begins immediately. Right  This idea  zero to three. My wife  Yvonne  and I  we have four kids  three grown ones and a    year old. That's a longer story. With our first kids  we did not know the science about brain development. We didn't know how critical those first three years were. We didn't know what was happening in those young brains. We didn't know the role that language  a stimulus and response  call and response  how important that was in developing those children. We know that now. What are we doing about it  Nothing. Wealthy people know. Educated people know. And their kids have an advantage. Poor people don't know  and we're not doing anything to help them at all. But we know this is critical. Now  you take pre kindergarten. We know it's important for kids. Poor kids need that experience. Nope. Lots of places  it doesn't exist. We know health services matter. You know  we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about  you know  because I'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff  but we do health services  and I have to raise a lot of money. People used to say when they'd come fund us   Geoff  why do you provide these health services   I used to make stuff up. Right  I'd say   Well  you know a child who has cavities is not going to  uh  be able to study as well.  And I had to because I had to raise the money. But now I'm older  and you know what I tell them  You know why I provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts  Because I actually like kids. I actually like kids.  Laughter   Applause  But when they really get pushy  people really get pushy  I say   I do it because you do it for your kid.  And you've never read a study from MIT that says giving your kid dance instruction is going to help them do algebra better  but you will give that kid dance instruction  and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction  and it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids have the same opportunity  It's the floor for these children. So here's the other thing. I'm a tester guy. I believe you need data  you need information  because you work at something  you think it's working  and you find out it's not working. I mean  you're educators. You work  you say  you think you've got it  great  no  And you find out they didn't get it. But here's the problem with testing. The testing that we do    we're going to have our test in New York next week   is in April. You know when we're going to get the results back  Maybe July  maybe June. And the results have great data. They'll tell you Raheem really struggled  couldn't do two digit multiplication    so great data  but you're getting it back after school is over. And so  what do you do  You go on vacation.  Laughter  You come back from vacation. Now you've got all of this test data from last year. You don't look at it. Why would you look at it  You're going to go and teach this year. So how much money did we just spend on all of that  Billions and billions of dollars for data that it's too late to use. I need that data in September. I need that data in November. I need to know you're struggling  and I need to know whether or not what I did corrected that. I need to know that this week. I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late. Because in my older years  I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant. I can predict school scores. You take me to any school. I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling. And you tell me last year    percent of those kids were on grade level. And I say   Okay  what's the plan  what did we do from last year to this year   You say   We're doing the same thing.  I'm going to make a prediction.  Laughter  This year  somewhere between    and    percent of those kids will be on grade level. And I will be right every single time. So we're spending all of this money  but we're getting what  Teachers need real information right now about what's happening to their kids. The high stakes is today  because you can do something about it. So here's the other issue that I just think we've got to be concerned about. We can't stifle innovation in our business. We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation. They get angry if you do something different. If you try something new  people are always like   Ooh  charter schools.  Hey  let's try some stuff. Let's see. This stuff hasn't worked for    years. Let's try something different. And here's the rub. Some of it's not going to work. You know  people tell me   Yeah  those charter schools  a lot of them don't work.  A lot of them don't. They should be closed. I mean  I really believe they should be closed. But we can't confuse figuring out the science and things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything. Right  Because that's not the way the world works. If you think about technology  imagine if that's how we thought about technology. Every time something didn't work  we just threw in the towel and said   Let's forget it.  Right  You know  they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me    the latest and greatest thing  the PalmPilot. They told me   Geoff  if you get this PalmPilot you'll never need another thing.  That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over. I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing. Did anybody stop inventing  Not a person. Not a soul. The folks went out there. They kept inventing. The fact that you have failure  that shouldn't stop you from pushing the science forward. Our job as educators  there's some stuff we know that we can do. And we've got to do better. The evaluation  we have to start with kids earlier  we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people. We've got to give them all of these opportunities. So that we have to do. But this innovation issue  this idea that we've got to keep innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical. And this is something  by the way  that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field. America cannot wait another    years to get this right. We have run out of time. I don't know about a fiscal cliff  but I know there's an educational cliff that we are walking over right this very second  and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness about saying we can't afford this   So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars. What is five billion dollars to the United States  What did we spend in Afghanistan this year  How many trillions   Applause  When the country cares about something  we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye. When the safety of America is threatened  we will spend any amount of money. The real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about. I dare say it's a pittance  what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems. So once we do that  I'll no longer be angry.  Laughter  So  you guys  help me get there. Thank you all very much. Thank you. John Legend  So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone  Geoffrey Canada  Well  you know  John      percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school. A hundred percent of them went to college. This year's seniors will have     percent graduating high school. Last I heard we had    percent accepted to college. We'd better get that other seven percent. So that's just how this goes.  Applause  JL  So how do you stick with them after they leave high school  GC  Well  you know  one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids  the same kids  these same vulnerable kids  when you get them in school  they drop out in record numbers. And so we've figured out that you've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does. They harass you  right  They call you  they say   I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test  What are you talking about that you want to leave school  And you're not coming back here.  So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem because Geoff is looking for you. They're like   I really can't come back.  No. You'd better stay in school. But I'm not kidding about some of this  and it gets a little bit to the grit issue. When kids know that you refuse to let them fail  it puts a different pressure on them  and they don't give up as easy. So sometimes they don't have it inside  and they're  like   You know  I don't want to do this  but I know my mother's going to be mad.  Well  that matters to kids  and it helps get them through. We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support  but also a set of encouragements that say to them   You can do it. It is going to be hard  but we refuse to let you fail.  JL  Well  thank you Dr. Canada. Please give it up for him one more time. When I was    years old  I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding  teaching. I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher  I made quizzes and tests. I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back  I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking. The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math  sure  they're hard  ratios  decimals  the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible  and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching  I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective  from a psychological perspective. In education  the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily  So I left the classroom  and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings  and in every study my question was  who is successful here and why  My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods  asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year  and of those  who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students  We partnered with private companies  asking  which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs  And who's going to earn the most money  In all those very different contexts  one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks  physical health  and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future  day in  day out  not just for the week  not just for the month  but for years  and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon  not a sprint. A few years ago  I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires  and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate  even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure  things like family income  standardized achievement test scores  even how safe kids felt when they were at school. So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school  especially for kids at risk for dropping out. To me  the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know  how little science knows  about building it. Every day  parents and teachers ask me   How do I build grit in kids  What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic  How do I keep them motivated for the long run   The honest answer is  I don't know. What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. In fact  in our data  grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. So far  the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called  growth mindset.  This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck  and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed  that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge  they're much more likely to persevere when they fail  because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit. But we need more. And that's where I'm going to end my remarks  because that's where we are. That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas  our strongest intuitions  and we need to test them. We need to measure whether we've been successful  and we have to be willing to fail  to be wrong  to start over again with lessons learned. In other words  we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you. Thank you very much. I moved to America    years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids. Actually  truthfully  we moved to Los Angeles    thinking we were moving to America  but anyway    It's a short plane ride from Los Angeles to America. I got here    years ago  and when I got here  I was told various things  like   Americans don't get irony.  Have you come across this idea  It's not true. I've traveled the whole length and breadth of this country. I have found no evidence that Americans don't get irony. It's one of those cultural myths  like   The British are reserved.  I don't know why people think this. We've invaded every country we've encountered. But it's not true Americans don't get irony  but I just want you to know that that's what people are saying about you behind your back. You know  so when you leave living rooms in Europe  people say  thankfully  nobody was ironic in your presence. But I knew that Americans get irony when I came across that legislation   No Child Left Behind.  Because whoever thought of that title gets irony. Don't they  Because it's leaving millions of children behind. Now I can see that's not a very attractive name for legislation   Millions of Children Left Behind.  I can see that. What's the plan  We propose to leave millions of children behind  and here's how it's going to work. And it's working beautifully. In some parts of the country     percent of kids drop out of high school. In the Native American communities  it's    percent of kids. If we halved that number  one estimate is it would create a net gain to the U.S. economy over    years  of nearly a trillion dollars. From an economic point of view  this is good math  isn't it  that we should do this  It actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis. But the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg. What it doesn't count are all the kids who are in school but being disengaged from it  who don't enjoy it  who don't get any real benefit from it. And the reason is not that we're not spending enough money. America spends more money on education than most other countries. Class sizes are smaller than in many countries. And there are hundreds of initiatives every year to try and improve education. The trouble is  it's all going in the wrong direction. There are three principles on which human life flourishes  and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure. The first is this  that human beings are naturally different and diverse. Can I ask you  how many of you have got children of your own  Okay. Or grandchildren. How about two children or more  Right. And the rest of you have seen such children. Small people wandering about. I will make you a bet  and I am confident that I will win the bet. If you've got two children or more  I bet you they are completely different from each other. Aren't they  You would never confuse them  would you  Like   Which one are you  Remind me.   Your mother and I need some color coding system so we don't get confused.  Education under  No Child Left Behind  is based on not diversity but conformity. What schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement. One of the effects of  No Child Left Behind  has been to narrow the focus onto the so called STEM disciplines. They're very important. I'm not here to argue against science and math. On the contrary  they're necessary but they're not sufficient. A real education has to give equal weight to the arts  the humanities  to physical education. An awful lot of kids  sorry  thank you    One estimate in America currently is that something like    percent of kids  getting on that way  are being diagnosed with various conditions under the broad title of attention deficit disorder. ADHD. I'm not saying there's no such thing. I just don't believe it's an epidemic like this. If you sit kids down  hour after hour  doing low grade clerical work  don't be surprised if they start to fidget  you know  Children are not  for the most part  suffering from a psychological condition. They're suffering from childhood. And I know this because I spent my early life as a child. I went through the whole thing. Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents  not just a small range of them. And by the way  the arts aren't just important because they improve math scores. They're important because they speak to parts of children's being which are otherwise untouched. The second  thank you    The second principle that drives human life flourishing is curiosity. If you can light the spark of curiosity in a child  they will learn without any further assistance  very often. Children are natural learners. It's a real achievement to put that particular ability out  or to stifle it. Curiosity is the engine of achievement. Now the reason I say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here  if I can say so  has been to de professionalize teachers. There is no system in the world or any school in the country that is better than its teachers. Teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools. But teaching is a creative profession. Teaching  properly conceived  is not a delivery system. You know  you're not there just to pass on received information. Great teachers do that  but what great teachers also do is mentor  stimulate  provoke  engage. You see  in the end  education is about learning. If there's no learning going on  there's no education going on. And people can spend an awful lot of time discussing education without ever discussing learning. The whole point of education is to get people to learn. An old friend of mine    actually very old  he's dead. That's as old as it gets  I'm afraid. But a wonderful guy he was  wonderful philosopher. He used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of verbs. You can be engaged in the activity of something  but not really be achieving it  like dieting. It's a very good example. There he is. He's dieting. Is he losing any weight  Not really. Teaching is a word like that. You can say   There's Deborah  she's in room     she's teaching.  But if nobody's learning anything  she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it. The role of a teacher is to facilitate learning. That's it. And part of the problem is  I think  that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning  but testing. Now  testing is important. Standardized tests have a place. But they should not be the dominant culture of education. They should be diagnostic. They should help. If I go for a medical examination  I want some standardized tests. I do. I want to know what my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else's on a standard scale. I don't want to be told on some scale my doctor invented in the car.  Your cholesterol is what I call Level Orange.   Really    Is that good    We don't know.  But all that should support learning. It shouldn't obstruct it  which of course it often does. So in place of curiosity  what we have is a culture of compliance. Our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity. And the third principle is this  that human life is inherently creative. It's why we all have different r sum s. We create our lives  and we can recreate them as we go through them. It's the common currency of being a human being. It's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic. I mean  other animals may well have imaginations and creativity  but it's not so much in evidence  is it  as ours  I mean  you may have a dog. And your dog may get depressed. You know  but it doesn't listen to Radiohead  does it  And sit staring out the window with a bottle of Jack Daniels.  Would you like to come for a walk    No  I'm fine.   You go. I'll wait. But take pictures.  We all create our own lives through this restless process of imagining alternatives and possibilities  and one of the roles of education is to awaken and develop these powers of creativity. Instead  what we have is a culture of standardization. Now  it doesn't have to be that way. It really doesn't. Finland regularly comes out on top in math  science and reading. Now  we only know that's what they do well at  because that's all that's being tested. That's one of the problems of the test. They don't look for other things that matter just as much. The thing about work in Finland is this  they don't obsess about those disciplines. They have a very broad approach to education  which includes humanities  physical education  the arts. Second  there is no standardized testing in Finland. I mean  there's a bit  but it's not what gets people up in the morning  what keeps them at their desks. The third thing    and I was at a meeting recently with some people from Finland  actual Finnish people  and somebody from the American system was saying to the people in Finland   What do you do about the drop out rate in Finland   And they all looked a bit bemused  and said   Well  we don't have one. Why would you drop out  If people are in trouble  we get to them quite quickly and we help and support them.  Now people always say   Well  you know  you can't compare Finland to America.  No. I think there's a population of around five million in Finland. But you can compare it to a state in America. Many states in America have fewer people in them than that. I mean  I've been to some states in America and I was the only person there. Really. Really. I was asked to lock up when I left. But what all the high performing systems in the world do is currently what is not evident  sadly  across the systems in America    I mean  as a whole. One is this  they individualize teaching and learning. They recognize that it's students who are learning and the system has to engage them  their curiosity  their individuality  and their creativity. That's how you get them to learn. The second is that they attribute a very high status to the teaching profession. They recognize that you can't improve education if you don't pick great people to teach and keep giving them constant support and professional development. Investing in professional development is not a cost. It's an investment  and every other country that's succeeding well knows that  whether it's Australia  Canada  South Korea  Singapore  Hong Kong or Shanghai. They know that to be the case. And the third is  they devolve responsibility to the school level for getting the job done. You see  there's a big difference here between going into a mode of command and control in education    That's what happens in some systems. Central or state governments decide  they know best and they're going to tell you what to do. The trouble is that education doesn't go on in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings. It happens in classrooms and schools  and the people who do it are the teachers and the students  and if you remove their discretion  it stops working. You have to put it back to the people. There is wonderful work happening in this country. But I have to say it's happening in spite of the dominant culture of education  not because of it. It's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time. And the reason I think is this  that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions of education. It's like education is an industrial process that can be improved just by having better data  and somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we fine tune it well enough  if we just get it right  it will all hum along perfectly into the future. It won't  and it never did. The point is that education is not a mechanical system. It's a human system. It's about people  people who either do want to learn or don't want to learn. Every student who drops out of school has a reason for it which is rooted in their own biography. They may find it boring. They may find it irrelevant. They may find that it's at odds with the life they're living outside of school. There are trends  but the stories are always unique. I was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of    they're called alternative education programs. These are programs designed to get kids back into education. They have certain common features. They're very personalized. They have strong support for the teachers  close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum  and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school. And they work. What's interesting to me is  these are called  alternative education.  You know  And all the evidence from around the world is  if we all did that  there'd be no need for the alternative. So I think we have to embrace a different metaphor. We have to recognize that it's a human system  and there are conditions under which people thrive  and conditions under which they don't. We are after all organic creatures  and the culture of the school is absolutely essential. Culture is an organic term  isn't it  Not far from where I live is a place called Death Valley. Death Valley is the hottest  driest place in America  and nothing grows there. Nothing grows there because it doesn't rain. Hence  Death Valley. In the winter of       it rained in Death Valley. Seven inches of rain fell over a very short period. And in the spring of       there was a phenomenon. The whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while. What it proved is this  that Death Valley isn't dead. It's dormant. Right beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility waiting for the right conditions to come about  and with organic systems  if the conditions are right  life is inevitable. It happens all the time. You take an area  a school  a district  you change the conditions  give people a different sense of possibility  a different set of expectations  a broader range of opportunities  you cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners  you offer people the discretion to be creative and to innovate in what they do  and schools that were once bereft spring to life. Great leaders know that. The real role of leadership in education    and I think it's true at the national level  the state level  at the school level    is not and should not be command and control. The real role of leadership is climate control  creating a climate of possibility. And if you do that  people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and couldn't have expected. There's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin.  There are three sorts of people in the world  Those who are immovable  people who don't get it  or don't want to do anything about it  there are people who are movable  people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it  and there are people who move  people who make things happen.  And if we can encourage more people  that will be a movement. And if the movement is strong enough  that's  in the best sense of the word  a revolution. And that's what we need. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. When I was in my   s  I saw my very first psychotherapy client. I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley. She was a    year old woman named Alex. Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top  and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems. Now when I heard this  I was so relieved. My classmate got an arsonist for her first client. And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys. This I thought I could handle. But I didn't handle it. With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session  it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road.  Thirty's the new      Alex would say  and as far as I could tell  she was right. Work happened later  marriage happened later  kids happened later  even death happened later. Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time. But before long  my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life. I pushed back. I said   Sure  she's dating down  she's sleeping with a knucklehead  but it's not like she's going to marry the guy.  And then my supervisor said   Not yet  but she might marry the next one. Besides  the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before she has one.  That's what psychologists call an  Aha   moment. That was the moment I realized     is not the new   . Yes  people settle down later than they used to  but that didn't make Alex's   s a developmental downtime. That made Alex's   s a developmental sweet spot  and we were sitting there  blowing it. That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem  and it had real consequences  not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere. There are    million twentysomethings in the United States right now. We're talking about    percent of the population  or     percent if you consider that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their   s first. Raise your hand if you're in your   s. I really want to see some twentysomethings here. Oh  yay  You are all awesome. If you work with twentysomethings  you love a twentysomething  you're losing sleep over twentysomethings  I want to see   Okay. Awesome  twentysomethings really matter. So  I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe that every single one of those    million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists  sociologists  neurologists and fertility specialists already know  that claiming your   s is one of the simplest  yet most transformative  things you can do for work  for love  for your happiness  maybe even for the world. This is not my opinion. These are the facts. We know that    percent of life's most defining moments take place by age   . That means that eight out of    of the decisions and experiences and  Aha   moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid   s. People who are over     don't panic. This crowd is going to be fine  I think. We know that the first    years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn. We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by   . We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your   s as it rewires itself for adulthood  which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself  now is the time to change it. We know that personality changes more during your   s than at any other time in life  and we know that female fertility peaks at age     and things get tricky after age   . So your   s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options. So when we think about child development  we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain. It's a time when your ordinary  day to day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become. But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing as adult development  and our   s are that critical period of adult development. But this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing. Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood. Researchers call the   s an extended adolescence. Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like  twixters  and  kidults.  As a culture  we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood. Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things  you need a plan and not quite enough time. So what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say   You have    extra years to start your life   Nothing happens. You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition  and absolutely nothing happens. And then every day  smart  interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this   I know my boyfriend's no good for me  but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time.  Or they say   Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I'm     I'll be fine.  But then it starts to sound like this   My   s are almost over  and I have nothing to show for myself. I had a better r sum  the day after I graduated from college.  And then it starts to sound like this   Dating in my   s was like musical chairs. Everybody was running around and having fun  but then sometime around    it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down. I didn't want to be the only one left standing up  so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at   .  Where are the twentysomethings here  Do not do that. Okay  now that sounds a little flip  but make no mistake  the stakes are very high. When a lot has been pushed to your   s  there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump start a career  pick a city  partner up  and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time. Many of these things are incompatible  and as research is just starting to show  simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our   s. The post millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car. It's realizing you can't have that career you now want. It's realizing you can't have that child you now want  or you can't give your child a sibling. Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves  and at me  sitting across the room  and say about their   s   What was I doing  What was I thinking   I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking. Here's a story about how that can go. It's a story about a woman named Emma. At     Emma came to my office because she was  in her words  having an identity crisis. She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment  but she hadn't decided yet  so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead. Because it was cheaper  she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition. And as hard as her   s were  her early life had been even harder. She often cried in our sessions  but then would collect herself by saying   You can't pick your family  but you can pick your friends.  Well one day  Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap  and she sobbed for most of the hour. She'd just bought a new address book  and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts  but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words  In case of emergency  please call ...  She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said   Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck  Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer   Now in that moment  it took everything I had not to say   I will.  But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really  really cared. Emma needed a better life  and I knew this was her chance. I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emma's defining decade went parading by. So over the next weeks and months  I told Emma three things that every twentysomething  male or female  deserves to hear. First  I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital. By  get identity capital   I mean do something that adds value to who you are. Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next. I didn't know the future of Emma's career  and no one knows the future of work  but I do know this  Identity capital begets identity capital. So now is the time for that cross country job  that internship  that startup you want to try. I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here  but I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count  which  by the way  is not exploration. That's procrastination. I told Emma to explore work and make it count. Second  I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated. Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport  but twentysomethings who huddle together with like minded peers limit who they know  what they know  how they think  how they speak  and where they work. That new piece of capital  that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle. New things come from what are called our weak ties  our friends of friends of friends. So yes  half of twentysomethings are un  or under employed. But half aren't  and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group. Half of new jobs are never posted  so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job. It's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads. Last but not least  Emma believed that you can't pick your family  but you can pick your friends. Now this was true for her growing up  but as a twentysomething  soon Emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own. I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now. Now you may be thinking that    is actually a better time to settle down than     or even     and I agree with you. But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress. The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one  and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work. Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you. So what happened to Emma  Well  we went through that address book  and she found an old roommate's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state. That weak tie helped her get a job there. That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live in boyfriend. Now  five years later  she's a special events planner for museums. She's married to a man she mindfully chose. She loves her new career  she loves her new family  and she sent me a card that said   Now the emergency contact blanks don't seem big enough.  Now Emma's story made that sound easy  but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings. They are so easy to help. Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX  bound for somewhere west. Right after takeoff  a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji. Likewise  at    or    or even     one good conversation  one good break  one good TED Talk  can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come. So here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know. It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex. It's what I now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day  Thirty is not the new     so claim your adulthood  get some identity capital  use your weak ties  pick your family. Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do. You're deciding your life right now. Thank you.  Don't talk to strangers.  You have heard that phrase uttered by your friends  family  schools and the media for decades. It's a norm. It's a social norm. But it's a special kind of social norm  because it's a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to.  Don't talk to strangers  says   Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you. Stick with the people you know. Stick with people like you.  How appealing is that  It's not really what we do  is it  when we're at our best  When we're at our best  we reach out to people who are not like us  because when we do that  we learn from people who are not like us. My phrase for this value of being with  not like us  is  strangeness   and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world  strangers are quite frankly not the point. The point that we should be worried about is  how much strangeness are we getting  Why strangeness  Because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data  and data turns our social relations into digital relations  and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness  a sense of discovery  a sense of surprise and unpredictability. Why not strangers  Because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries. They belong to a world of people I know versus people I don't know  and in the context of my digital relations  I'm already doing things with people I don't know. The question isn't whether or not I know you. The question is  what can I do with you  What can I learn with you  What can we do together that benefits us both  I spend a lot of time thinking about how the social landscape is changing  how new technologies create new constraints and new opportunities for people. The most important changes facing us today have to do with data and what data is doing to shape the kinds of digital relations that will be possible for us in the future. The economies of the future depend on that. Our social lives in the future depend on that. The threat to worry about isn't strangers. The threat to worry about is whether or not we're getting our fair share of strangeness. Now    th century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers  but they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations  and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices. Stanley Milgram from the '  s and '  s  the creator of the small world experiments  which became later popularized as six degrees of separation  made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps. His point was that strangers are out there. We can reach them. There are paths that enable us to reach them. Mark Granovetter  Stanford sociologist  in      in his seminal essay  The Strength of Weak Ties   made the point that these weak ties that are a part of our networks  these strangers  are actually more effective at diffusing information to us than are our strong ties  the people closest to us. He makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us  these strong ties in our lives  actually have a homogenizing effect on us. They produce sameness. My colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives  what kinds of new routines are possible. We've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms that have enabled us to take our possessions  those things that used to be very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses  and to make them available to people we don't know. Whether it's our clothes  whether it's our cars  whether it's our bikes  whether it's our books or music  we are able to take our possessions now and make them available to people we've never met. And we concluded a very important insight  which was that as people's relationships to the things in their lives change  so do their relations with other people. And yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat. It continues to try to predict what I need based on some past characterization of who I am  of what I've already done. Security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks  keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations. Categories like  friends  and  family  and  contacts  and  colleagues  don't tell me anything about my actual relations. A more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance  where at any given point in time  with any single person  I am both close and distant from that individual  all as a function of what I need to do right now. People aren't close or distant. People are always a combination of the two  and that combination is constantly changing. What if technologies could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships  What if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that I need right now  Strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that I need right now  that enables me to find the sources of intimacy  of discovery  and of inspiration that I need right now. Strangeness is not about meeting strangers. It simply makes the point that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity. So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness  and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today  but also by organizations  organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities. Whether you're a political party insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not  whether you're the government protecting social institutions like marriage and restricting access of those institutions to the few  whether you're a teenager in her bedroom who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents  strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way to new kinds of relations. We have to change the norms. We have to change the norms in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses. What interesting questions lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers  How might we think differently about our relations with people  How might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people  How might we think differently about our relations with technologies  things that effectively become social participants in their own right  The range of digital relations is extraordinary. In the context of this broad range of digital relations  safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation. Thank you. Liu Bolin  By making myself invisible  I try to question the inter canceling relationship between our civilization and its development. Interpreter  By making myself invisible  I try to explore and question the contradictory and often inter canceling relationship between our civilization and its development. LB  This is my first work  created in November     . And this is Beijing International Art Camp where I worked before the government forcibly demolished it.I used this work to express my objection. I also want to use this work to let more people pay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom. In the meantime  from the beginning  this series has a protesting  reflective and uncompromising spirit. When applying makeup  I borrow a sniper's method to better protect myself and to detect the enemy  as he did.  Laughter  After finishing this series of protests  I started questioning why my fate was like this  and I realized that it's not just me    all Chinese are as confused as I am. As you can see  these works are about family planning  election in accordance with the law and propaganda of the institution of the People's Congress. This work is called Xia Gang   leaving post  .  Xia Gang  is a Chinese euphemism for  laid off . It refers to those people who lost their jobs during China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy. From      to         .   million people lost their jobs in China. The six people in the photo are Xia Gang workers. I made them invisible in the deserted shop wherethey had lived and worked all their lives. On the wall behind them is the slogan of the Cultural Revolution   The core force leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party.  For half a month I looked for these   people to participate in my work. We can only see six men in this picture but in fact  those who are hidden here are all people who were laid off. They have just been made invisible. This piece is called The Studio. This spring  I happened to have an opportunity during my solo exhibition in Paris to shoot a work in the news studio of France      I picked the news photos of the day. One is about the war in the Middle East  and another one is about a public demonstration in France. I found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions. This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR. Interpreter  This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR. LB  I tried to disappear into JR's eye  but the problem is JR only uses models with big eyes. So I tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers. But still they are not big enough for JR  unfortunately. Interpreter  So I tried to disappear into JR's eye  but the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes. So I tried to make my eyes bigger with this gesture. But it doesn't work  my eyes are still small. LB  This one is about      memories. This is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the Hudson River. Kenny Scharf's graffiti. This is Venice  Italy. Because global temperatures rise  the sea level rises  and it is said thatVenice will disappear in the coming decades. This is the ancient city of Pompeii. Interpreter  This is the ancient city of Pompeii. LB  This is the Borghese Gallery in Rome. When I work on a new piece  I pay more attention to the expression of ideas. For instance  why would I make myself invisible  What will making myself invisible here cause people to think  This one is called Instant Noodles. Interpreter  This one is called Instant Noodles.  Laughter  LB  Since August       harmful phosphors have been found in the instant noodle package cups from every famous brand sold in China's supermarkets. These phosphors can even cause cancer. To create this artwork  I bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups and put them in my studio  making it look like a supermarket. And my task is to stand there  trying to be still  setting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant and drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body on the front of my body. If the background is simple  I usually have to stand for three to four hours. The background of this piece is more complex  so I need three to four days in advance for preparation. This is the suit I wore when I did the supermarket shoot. There is no Photoshop involved. Interpreter  This is the suit I  was  wearing when I did the supermarket shoot. There is no Photoshop involved.  Laughter  LB  These works are on China's cultural memories. And this one  this is about food safety in China. Unsafe food can harm people's health  and a deluge of magazines can confuse people's minds.  Laughter  The next pieces of work show how I made myself invisible in magazines of different languages  in different countries and at different times. I think that in art  an artist's attitude is the most important element. If an artwork is to touch someone  it must be the result of not only technique  but also the artist's thinking and struggle in life. And the repeated struggles in life create artwork  no matter in what form. That's all I want to say. Thank you.  Applause  Hey guys. It's funny  someone just mentioned MacGyver  because that was  like  I loved it  and when I was seven  I taped a fork to a drill and I was like   Hey  Mom  I'm going to Olive Garden.  And     Drilling noise   Laughter  And it worked really well there. And you know  it had a profound effect on me. It sounds silly  but I thought  okay  the way the world works can be changed  and it can be changed by me in these small ways. And my relationship to especially human made objects which someone else said they work like this  well  I can say they work a different way  a little bit. And so  about    years later  I didn't realize the full effect of this  but I went to Costa Rica and I stayed with these Guaym  natives there  and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them  and they could make beds out of trees  and they could    I watched this woman for three days. I was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart  these little threads off of it  and she'd roll the threads together and make little thicker threads  like strings  and she would weave the strings together  and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days  the materiality of the way the world works  of reality  kind of started to unravel in my mind  because I realized that this bag and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener  everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to  maybe a more complicated one  but still  everything was made that way. And so I had to start studying  who is it that's making these decisions  Who's making these things  How did they make them  What stops us from making them  Because this is how reality is created. So I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab  and I was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity. And I started in nature  because I saw these Guaym s doing it in nature  and there just seems to be less barriers. So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp  where there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out and willing to try anything. So I said   Let's go into the woods near this stream and just put stuff together  you know  make something  I don't care  geometrical shapes  just grab some junk from around you. We won't bring anything with us. And  like  within minutes  this is very easy for adults and teens to do. Here's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream  and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together. A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass. The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it. And after about    minutes  you get really intricate projects like leaves sorted by hue  so you get a color fade and put in a circle like a wreath. And the creator of this  he said   This is fire. I call this fire.  And someone asked him   How do you get those sticks to stay on that tree   And he's like   I don't know  but I can show you.  And I'm like   Wow  that's really amazing. He doesn't know  but he can show you.  So his hands know and his intuition knows  but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be  especially when it comes to the human made  human built world. We think we already know how something works  so we can't imagine how it could work. We know how it's supposed to work  so we can't suppose all the things that could be possible. So kids don't have as hard of a time with this  and I saw in my own son  I gave him this book. I'm a good hippie dad  so I'm like   Okay  you're going to learn to love the moon. I'm going to give you some building blocks and they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks  so it's totally legit.  But he doesn't really know what to do with these. I didn't show him. And so he's like   Okay  I'll just mess around with this.  This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest. Just going to try to put them in shapes and push on them and stuff. And before long  he's kind of got this mechanism where you can almost launch and catapult objects around  and he enlists us in helping him. And at this point  I'm starting to wonder  what kind of tools can we give people  especially adults  who know too much  so that they can see the world as malleable  so they see themselves as agents of change in their everyday lives. Because the most advanced scientists are really just kind of pushing the way the world itself works  pushing what matter can do  the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium  and any sufficiently complicated task  whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child    anything that's complicated    comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it  and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say   Okay  well we're just going to have to refigure this. I don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing. I'm going to use them a different way.  So let me show you a little demo. This is a little piano circuit right in here  and this is an ordinary paintbrush that I smashed it together with.  Beeping  And so  with some ketchup     musical notes    and then I can kind of    musical notes    And that's awesome  right  But this is not what's awesome. What's awesome is what happens when you give the piano circuit to people. A pencil is not just a pencil. Look what it has in the middle of it. That's a wire running down the middle  and not only is it a wire  if you take that piano circuit  you can thumbtack into the middle of a pencil  and you can lay out wire on the page  too  and get electrical current to run through it. And so you can kind of hack a pencil  just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit. And the electricity runs through your body too. And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil. You can make one of these brushes just on the fly. All you do is connect to the bristles  and the bristles are wet  so they conduct  and the person's body conducts  and leather is great to paint on  and then you can start hooking to everything  even the kitchen sink. The metal in the sink is conductive. Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin. And you can even hook to the trees. Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive  and you can use those together. So    Laughter    I took this to those same teens  because those teens are really awesome  and they'll try things that I won't try. I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to. And this young woman  she made what she called a hula looper  and as the hula hoop traveled around her body  she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there. You can see her pointing to it in the picture. And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body  it would connect two little pieces of copper tape  and it would make a sound  and the next sound  and it would loop the same sounds over and over again. I ran these workshops everywhere. In Taiwan  at an art museum  this    year old girl made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan and some electrical tape and hot glue. And professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it. And big companies like Intel or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump  were inviting me to give workshops  just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together. And then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics  but let's just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over. And so I just want to do a quick demo. So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit  and I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you. So I'll just plug it in  and now it's on by USB. And I'll just hook up the forward arrow. You guys are facing that way  so I'll hook it to this one. And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it. And now  if I touch this piece of pizza  the slides that I showed you before should go forward. And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow  I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up  now I have a left arrow and a right arrow  so I should be able to go forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards. Awesome. And so we're like   We gotta put a video out about this.  Because no one really believed that this was important or meaningful except me and  like  one other guy. So we made a video to prove that there's lots of stuff you can do. You can kind of sketch with Play Doh and just Google for game controllers. Just ordinary Play Doh  nothing special. And you can literally draw joysticks and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up.  Video game noises  And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target  Well  if you take those out  they hold water great  but you can totally cut your toes  so yeah  just be careful. You know the Happiness Project  where the experts are setting up the piano stairs  and how cool that is  Well  I think it's cool  but we should be doing that stuff ourselves. It shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works. We should all be participating in changing the way the world works together. Aluminum foil. Everybody has a cat. Get a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS. Hover the mouse over the  take a photo  button  and you've got a little cat photo booth. And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this. If hundreds of people didn't buy this  we couldn't put it on the market. And so we put it up on Kickstarter  and hundreds of people bought it in the first day. And then    days later         people had backed the project. And then what the best part is  we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it. So this is  The Star Spangled Banner  by eating lunch  including drinking Listerine. And we actually sent this guy materials. We're like   We're sponsoring you  man. You're  like  a pro maker.  Okay  just wait for this one. This is good. And these guys at the exploratorium are playing house plants as if they were drums. And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways. And then this brother    look at this diagram. See where it says  sister   I love when people put humans on the diagram. I always add humans to any technical    if you're drawing a technical diagram  put a human in it. And this kid is so sweet. He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister so that on her birthday  she could be the star of the show  jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides. And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano. And this is fun  and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun  But it's also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up  where people can't use computers  necessarily. Like this dad who wrote us  his son has cerebral palsy and he can't use a normal keyboard. And so his dad couldn't necessarily afford to buy all these custom controllers. And so  with the MaKey MaKey  he planned to make these gloves to allow him to navigate the web. And a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came  and we're really excited about that. We didn't plan for that at all. And then all these professional musicians started using it  like at Coachella  just this weekend Jurassic   was using this onstage  and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn  right around here  and he put this up last month. And I love the carrot on the turntable. Most people cannot play them that way.  Laughter  And when this started to get serious  I thought  I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in  because otherwise people are going to be getting this and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change  and governments will be crumbling  and I wouldn't have told people  so I thought I'd better warn them. And I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid of the box  it says   The world is a construction kit.  And as you start to mess around this way  I think that  in some small ways  you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with  and a little bit more like you could participate in designing the future of the way the world works. And so next time you're on an escalator and you drop an M M by accident  you know  maybe that's an M M surfboard  not an escalator  so don't pick it up right away. Maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets and throw it down  and maybe some chapstick  whatever. I used to want to design a utopian society or a perfect world or something like that. But as I'm kind of getting older and kind of messing with all this stuff  I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world really can't be designed by one person or even by a million experts. It's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands  each following their own passions  and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens. And that's the world I really want to live in. Thank you. Okay  it's great to be back at TED. Why don't I just start by firing away with the video  Woman  This is it. We're on in two minutes. Man    Okay Glass  hang out with The Flying Club. Man    Google  photos of tiger heads.  Hmm. Man    You ready  You ready   Barking  Woman    Right there. Okay  Glass  take a picture. Man    Go  Man    Holy  beep   That is awesome. Child  Whoa  Look at that snake  Woman    Okay  Glass  record a video  Man    After this bridge  first exit. Man    Okay  A    right there  Man    Google  say  delicious  in Thai. Google Glass       Man    Mmm       . Woman    Google  jellyfish.  Man     It's beautiful. Sergey Brin  Oh  sorry  I just got this message from a Nigerian prince. He needs help getting    million dollars. I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company  and it's gone pretty well. Though in all seriousness  this position that you just saw me in  looking down at my phone  that's one of the reasons behind this project  Project Glass. Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life  how you want to connect to information. Should it be by just walking around looking down  But that was the vision behind Glass  and that's why we've created this form factor. Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot  but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it. In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you're out and about looking at your phone  it's kind of  is this what you're meant to do with your body  You're standing around there and you're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass. You're just kind of moving around. So when we developed Glass  we thought really about  can we make something that frees your hands  You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there. They were all wearing Glass  and that's how we got that footage. And also you want something that frees your eyes. That's why we put the display up high  out of your line of sight  so it wouldn't be where you're looking and it wouldn't be where you're making eye contact with people. And also we wanted to free up the ears  so the sound actually goes through  conducts straight to the bones in your cranium  which is a little bit freaky at first  but you get used to it. And ironically  if you want to hear it better  you actually just cover your ear  which is kind of surprising  but that's how it works. My vision when we started Google    years ago was that eventually you wouldn't have to have a search query at all. You'd just have information come to you as you needed it. And this is now     years later  sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth. This project has lasted now  been just over two years. We've learned an amazing amount. It's been really important to make it comfortable. So our first prototypes we built were huge. It was like cell phones strapped to your head. It was very heavy  pretty uncomfortable. We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job  and then she almost ran away screaming. But we've come a long way. And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera. Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all  but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family  my kids. I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment. And lastly I've realized  in experimenting with this device  that I also kind of have a nervous tic. The cell phone is    yeah  you have to look down on it and all that  but it's also kind of a nervous habit. Like if I smoked  I'd probably just smoke instead. I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler. You know  I'd be like    But in this case  you know  I whip this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to. But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away  be it email or social posts or whatnot  even though it wasn't really    there's nothing really that important or that pressing. And with this  I know I will get certain messages if I really need them  but I don't have to be checking them all the time. Yeah  I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more  doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video. Thank you all very much. There's something that I'd like you to see. millions in China  footage of a two year old girl hit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby  footage too graphic to be shown. The entire accident is caught on camera. The driver pauses after hitting the child  his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second. Within two minutes  three people pass two year old Wang Yue by. The first walks around the badly injured toddler completely. Others look at her before moving off. Peter Singer  There were other people who walked past Wang Yue  and a second van ran over her legs before a street cleaner raised the alarm. She was rushed to hospital  but it was too late. She died. I wonder how many of you  looking at that  said to yourselves just now   I would not have done that. I would have stopped to help.  Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you. As I thought  that's most of you. And I believe you. I'm sure you're right. But before you give yourself too much credit  look at this. UNICEF reports that in        .  million children under five died from preventable  poverty related diseases. UNICEF thinks that that's good news because the figure has been steadily coming down from    million in     . That is good. But still   .  million is        children dying every day. Does it really matter that we're not walking past them in the street  Does it really matter that they're far away  I don't think it does make a morally relevant difference. The fact that they're not right in front of us  the fact  of course  that they're of a different nationality or race  none of that seems morally relevant to me. What is really important is  can we reduce that death toll  Can we save some of those        children dying every day  And the answer is  yes we can. Each of us spends money on things that we do not really need. You can think what your own habit is  whether it's a new car  a vacation or just something like buying bottled water when the water that comes out of the tap is perfectly safe to drink. You could take the money you're spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization  the Against Malaria Foundation  which would take the money you had given and use it to buy nets like this one to protect children like this one  and we know reliably that if we provide nets  they're used  and they reduce the number of children dying from malaria  just one of the many preventable diseases that are responsible for some of those        children dying every day. Fortunately  more and more people are understanding this idea  and the result is a growing movement  effective altruism. It's important because it combines both the heart and the head. The heart  of course  you felt. You felt the empathy for that child. But it's really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effective and well directed  and not only that  but also I think reason helps us to understand that other people  wherever they are  are like us  that they can suffer as we can  that parents grieve for the deaths of their children  as we do  and that just as our lives and our well being matter to us  it matters just as much to all of these people. So I think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want. It does help us to put perspective on our situation. And I think that's why many of the most significant people in effective altruism have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math. And that might seem surprising  because a lot of people think   Philosophy is remote from the real world  economics  we're told  just makes us more selfish  and we know that math is for nerds.  But in fact it does make a difference  and in fact there's one particular nerd who has been a particularly effective altruist because he got this. This is the website of the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation  and if you look at the words on the top right hand side  it says   All lives have equal value.  That's the understanding  the rational understanding of our situation in the world that has led to these people being the most effective altruists in history  Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. No one  not Andrew Carnegie  not John D. Rockefeller  has ever given as much to charity as each one of these three  and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is highly effective. According to one estimate  the Gates Foundation has already saved  .  million lives and many millions more  people  getting diseases that would have made them very sick  even if eventually they survived. Over the coming years  undoubtably the Gates Foundation is going to give a lot more  is going to save a lot more lives. Well  you might say  that's fine if you're a billionaire  you can have that kind of impact. But if I'm not  what can I do  So I'm going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe stand in the way of them giving. They worry how much of a difference they can make. But you don't have to be a billionaire. This is Toby Ord. He's a research fellow in philosophy at the University of Oxford. He became an effective altruist when he calculated that with the money that he was likely to earn throughout his career  an academic career  he could give enough to cure        people of blindness in developing countries and still have enough left for a perfectly adequate standard of living. So Toby founded an organization called Giving What We Can to spread this information  to unite people who want to share some of their income  and to ask people to pledge to give    percent of what they earn over their lifetime to fighting global poverty. Toby himself does better than that. He's pledged to live on        pounds a year    that's less than        dollars    and to give the rest to those organizations. And yes  Toby is married and he does have a mortgage. This is a couple at a later stage of life  Charlie Bresler and Diana Schott  who  when they were young  when they met  were activists against the Vietnam War  fought for social justice  and then moved into careers  as most people do  didn't really do anything very active about those values  although they didn't abandon them. And then  as they got to the age at which many people start to think of retirement  they returned to them  and they've decided to cut back on their spending  to live modestly  and to give both money and time to helping to fight global poverty. Now  mentioning time might lead you to think   Well  should I abandon my career and put all of my time into saving some of these        lives that are lost every day   One person who's thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch. He's a graduate student in philosophy  and he's set up a website called        Hours  the number of hours he estimates most people spend on their career  to advise people on how to have the best  most effective career. But you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider  if they have the right abilities and character  is to go into banking or finance. Why  Because if you earn a lot of money  you can give away a lot of money  and if you're successful in that career  you could give enough to an aid organization so that it could employ  let's say  five aid workers in developing countries  and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done. So you can quintuple the impact by leading that kind of career. Here's one young man who's taken this advice. His name is Matt Weiger. He was a student at Princeton in philosophy and math  actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis last year when he graduated. But he's gone into finance in New York. He's already earning enough so that he's giving a six figure sum to effective charities and still leaving himself with enough to live on. Matt has also helped me to set up an organization that I'm working with that has the name taken from the title of a book I wrote   The Life You Can Save   which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we're going to live an ethical life  it's not enough just to follow the thou shalt nots and not cheat  steal  maim  kill  but that if we have enough  we have to share some of that with people who have so little. And the organization draws together people of different generations  like Holly Morgan  who's an undergraduate  who's pledged to give    percent of the little amount that she has  and on the right  Ada Wan  who has worked directly for the poor  but has now gone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give. Many people will think  though  that charities aren't really all that effective. So let's talk about effectiveness. Toby Ord is very concerned about this  and he's calculated that some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others  so it's very important to find the effective ones. Take  for example  providing a guide dog for a blind person. That's a good thing to do  right  Well  right  it is a good thing to do  but you have to think what else you could do with the resources. It costs about        dollars to train a guide dog and train the recipient so that the guide dog can be an effective help to a blind person. It costs somewhere between    and    dollars to cure a blind person in a developing country if they have trachoma. So you do the sums  and you get something like that. You could provide one guide dog for one blind American  or you could cure between     and       people of blindness. I think it's clear what's the better thing to do. But if you want to look for effective charities  this is a good website to go to. GiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities  not just whether they're well run  and it's screened hundreds of charities and currently is recommending only three  of which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one. So it's very tough. If you want to look for other recommendations  thelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can both have a somewhat broader list  but you can find effective organizations  and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor. I'm pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations. That's another cause that I've been concerned about all my life  the immense amount of suffering that humans inflict on literally tens of billions of animals every year. So if you want to look for effective organizations to reduce that suffering  you can go to Effective Animal Activism. And some effective altruists think it's very important to make sure that our species survives at all. So they're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction. Here's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of recently  when an asteroid passed close to our planet. Possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of asteroids that might collide with us  but actually to deflect them. So some people think that would be a good thing to give to. There's many possibilities. My final question is  some people will think it's a burden to give. I don't really believe it is. I've enjoyed giving all of my life since I was a graduate student. It's been something fulfilling to me. Charlie Bresler said to me that he's not an altruist. He thinks that the life he's saving is his own. And Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression until she got involved with effective altruism  and now is one of the happiest people she knows. I think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what I call the Sisyphus problem. Here's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian  condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder up to the top of the hill. Just as he gets there  the effort becomes too much  the boulder escapes  rolls all the way down the hill  he has to trudge back down to push it up again  and the same thing happens again and again for all eternity. Does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle  where you work hard to get money  you spend that money on consumer goods which you hope you'll enjoy using  But then the money's gone  you have to work hard to get more  spend more  and to maintain the same level of happiness  it's kind of a hedonic treadmill. You never get off  and you never really feel satisfied. Becoming an effective altruist gives you that meaning and fulfillment. It enables you to have a solid basis for self esteem on which you can feel your life was really worth living. I'm going to conclude by telling you about an email that I received while I was writing this talk just a month or so ago. It's from a man named Chris Croy  who I'd never heard of. This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery. Why was he recovering from surgery  The email began   Last Tuesday  I anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger. That started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys.  There's about     people each year in the U.S. and more in other countries who do that. I was pleased to read it. Chris went on to say that he'd been influenced by my writings in what he did. Well  I have to admit  I'm also somewhat embarrassed by that  because I still have two kidneys. But Chris went on to say that he didn't think that what he'd done was all that amazing  because he calculated that the number of life years that he had added to people  the extension of life  was about the same that you could achieve if you gave       dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation. And that did make me feel a little bit better  because I have given more than       dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation and to various other effective charities. So if you're feeling bad because you still have two kidneys as well  there's a way for you to get off the hook. Thank you. So  when I was in art school  I developed a shake in my hand  and this was the straightest line I could draw. Now in hindsight  it was actually good for some things  like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid  but at the time this was really doomsday. This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist. The shake developed out of  really  a single minded pursuit of pointillism  just years of making tiny  tiny dots. And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles  because of the shake. So to compensate  I'd hold the pen tighter  and this progressively made the shake worse  so I'd hold the pen tighter still. And this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues  I had trouble holding anything. And after spending all my life wanting to do art  I left art school  and then I left art completely. But after a few years  I just couldn't stay away from art  and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and discovered I had permanent nerve damage. And he actually took one look at my squiggly line  and said   Well  why don't you just embrace the shake   So I did. I went home  I grabbed a pencil  and I just started letting my hand shake and shake. I was making all these scribble pictures. And even though it wasn't the kind of art that I was ultimately passionate about  it felt great. And more importantly  once I embraced the shake  I realized I could still make art. I just had to find a different approach to making the art that I wanted. Now  I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism  seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole. So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn't affect the work  like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas  or  in a  D structure consisting of two by fours  creating a  D image by burning it with a blowtorch. I discovered that  if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials  my hand really wouldn't hurt  and after having gone from a single approach to art  I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons. This was the first time I'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity. At the time  I was finishing up school  and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies. I had this horrible little set of tools  and I felt like I could do so much more with the supplies I thought an artist was supposed to have. I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors. I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair from the office that I worked at. So I got out of school  I got a job  I got a paycheck  I got myself to the art store  and I just went nuts buying supplies. And then when I got home  I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box. But I sat there for hours  and nothing came to mind. The same thing the next day  and then the next  quickly slipping into a creative slump. And I was in a dark place for a long time  unable to create. And it didn't make any sense  because I was finally able to support my art  and yet I was creatively blank. But as I searched around in the darkness  I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that I never had before. And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands. Embrace the shake. And I realized  if I ever wanted my creativity back  I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it. I wondered  could you become more creative  then  by looking for limitations  What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies  At this point  I was spending a lot of my evenings in    well  I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks   but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one  so I decided to ask for   . Surprisingly  they just handed them right over  and then with some pencils I already had  I made this project for only    cents. It really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be limited in order to become limitless. I took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas  and wondered what if  instead of painting on a canvas  I could only paint on my chest  So I painted    images  one layer at a time  one on top of another  with each picture representing an influence in my life. Or what if  instead of painting with a brush  I could only paint with karate chops   Laughter  So I'd dip my hands in paint  and I just attacked the canvas  and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks. Or  what if instead of relying on myself  I had to rely on other people to create the content for the art  So for six days  I lived in front of a webcam. I slept on the floor and I ate takeout  and I asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life changing moment. Their stories became the art as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas. Or what if instead of making art to display  I had to destroy it  This seemed like the ultimate limitation  being an artist without art. This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that I called Goodbye Art  where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation. In the beginning of Goodbye Art  I focused on forced destruction  like this image of Jimi Hendrix  made with over       matches. Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally. I looked for temporary materials  like spitting out food    sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine. The last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place. So I organized candles on a table  I lit them  and then blew them out  then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles  then assembled the videos into the larger image. So the end image was never visible as a physical whole. It was destroyed before it ever existed. In the course of this Goodbye Art series  I created    different pieces with nothing left to physically display. What I thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation  as each time I created  the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project. It did not happen overnight. There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground  or  even worse  after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing. But having committed to the process  I continued on  and something really surprising came out of this. As I destroyed each project  I was learning to let go  let go of outcomes  let go of failures  and let go of imperfections. And in return  I found a process of creating art that's perpetual and unencumbered by results. I found myself in a state of constant creation  thinking only of what's next and coming up with more ideas than ever. When I think back to my three years away from art  away from my dream  just going through the motions  instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream  I just quit  I gave up. And what if I didn't embrace the shake  Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills. It turned out to be about life  and having life skills. Because ultimately  most of what we do takes place here  inside the box  with limited resources. Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and  collectively  transform our world. Looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life. Now  when I run into a barrier or I find myself creatively stumped  I sometimes still struggle  but I continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities  like using hundreds of real  live worms to make an image  using a pushpin to tattoo a banana  or painting a picture with hamburger grease. One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate. Limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity  but perhaps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts  rethink categories and challenge accepted norms. And instead of telling each other to seize the day  maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation. Thank you. What would be a good end of life  And I'm talking about the very end. I'm talking about dying. We all think a lot about how to live well. I'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well. I'm not a geriatrician. I design reading programs for preschoolers. What I know about this topic comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two. In the last few years  I helped two friends have the end of life they wanted. Jim and Shirley Modini spent their    years of marriage living off the grid on their       acre ranch in the mountains of Sonoma County. They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge for the bears and lions and so many other things that lived there. This was their dream. I met Jim and Shirley in their   s. They were both only children who chose not to have kids. As we became friends  I became their trustee and their medical advocate  but more importantly  I became the person who managed their end of life experiences. And we learned a few things about how to have a good end. In their final years  Jim and Shirley faced cancers  fractures  infections  neurological illness. It's true. At the end  our bodily functions and independence are declining to zero. What we found is that  with a plan and the right people  quality of life can remain high. The beginning of the end is triggered by a mortality awareness event  and during this time  Jim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves to take their ranch over when they were gone. This gave them the peace of mind to move forward. It might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition. But one day  you're going to say   This thing is going to get me.  Jim and Shirley spent this time letting friends know that their end was near and that they were okay with that. Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness are different. In both cases  last days are about quiet reassurance. Jim died first. He was conscious until the very end  but on his last day he couldn't talk. Through his eyes  we knew when he needed to hear again   It is all set  Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley right here at the ranch  and ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever.  From this experience I'm going to share five practices. I've put worksheets online  so if you'd like  you can plan your own end. It starts with a plan. Most people say   I'd like to die at home.  Eighty percent of Americans die in a hospital or a nursing home. Saying we'd like to die at home is not a plan. A lot of people say   If I get like that  just shoot me.  This is not a plan either  this is illegal. A plan involves answering straightforward questions about the end you want. Where do you want to be when you're no longer independent  What do you want in terms of medical intervention  And who's going to make sure your plan is followed  You will need advocates. Having more than one increases your chance of getting the end you want. Don't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child. You want someone who has the time and proximity to do this job well  and you want someone who can work with people under the pressure of an ever changing situation. Hospital readiness is critical. You are likely to be headed to the emergency room  and you want to get this right. Prepare a one page summary of your medical history  medications and physician information. Put this in a really bright envelope with copies of your insurance cards  your power of attorney  and your do not resuscitate order. Have advocates keep a set in their car. Tape a set to your refrigerator. When you show up in the E.R. with this packet  your admission is streamlined in a material way. You're going to need caregivers. You'll need to assess your personality and financial situation to determine whether an elder care community or staying at home is your best choice. In either case  do not settle. We went through a number of not quite right caregivers before we found the perfect team led by Marsha  who won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you when you can't get out there  and Caitlin  who won't let you skip your morning exercises but knows when you need to hear that your wife is in good hands. Finally  last words. What do you want to hear at the very end  and from whom would you like to hear it  In my experience  you'll want to hear that whatever you're worried about is going to be fine. When you believe it's okay to let go  you will. So  this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial. What I've learned is if we put some time into planning our end of life  we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life. Here are Jim and Shirley just after deciding who would take care of their ranch. Here's Jim just a few weeks before he died  celebrating a birthday he didn't expect to see. And here's Shirley just a few days before she died being read an article in that day's paper about the significance of the wildlife refuge at the Modini ranch. Jim and Shirley had a good end of life  and by sharing their story with you  I hope to increase our chances of doing the same. Thank you. When we use the word  architect  or  designer   what we usually mean is a professional  someone who gets paid  and we tend to assume that it's those professionals who are going to be the ones to help us solve the really big  systemic design challenges that we face like climate change  urbanization and social inequality. That's our kind of working presumption. And I think it's wrong  actually. In       I was just about to graduate from architecture school after several years  and go out and get a job  and this happened. The economy ran out of jobs. And a couple of things struck me about this. One  don't listen to career advisers. And two  actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture  which is that  as a society  we've never needed design thinking more  and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed. It strikes me that we talk very deeply about design  but actually there's an economics behind architecture that we don't talk about  and I think we need to. And a good place to start is your own paycheck. So  as a bottom of the rung architecture graduate  I might expect to earn about        pounds. That's about                dollars. Now in terms of the whole world's population  that already puts me in the top  .   richest people  which raises the question of  who is it I'm working for  The uncomfortable fact is that actually almost everything that we call architecture today is actually the business of designing for about the richest one percent of the world's population  and it always has been. The reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when  actually  the one percent would build on behalf of the    percent  for various different reasons  whether that was through philanthropy in the   th century  communism in the early   th  the welfare state  and most recently  of course  through this inflated real estate bubble. And all of those booms  in their own various ways  have now kicked the bucket  and we're back in this situation where the smartest designers and architects in the world are only really able to work for one percent of the population. Now it's not just that that's bad for democracy  though I think it probably is  it's actually not a very clever business strategy  actually. I think the challenge facing the next generation of architects is  how are we going to turn our client from the one percent to the     percent  And I want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas for how it might be done. The first is  I think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings. Actually  a building is about the most expensive solution you can think of to almost any given problem. And fundamentally  design should be much  much more interested in solving problems and creating new conditions. So here's a story. The office was working with a school  and they had an old Victorian school building. And they said to the architects   Look  our corridors are an absolute nightmare. They're far too small. They get congested between classes. There's bullying. We can't control them. So what we want you to do is re plan our entire building  and we know it's going to cost several million pounds  but we're reconciled to the fact.  And the team thought about this  and they went away  and they said   Actually  don't do that. Instead  get rid of the school bell. And instead of having one school bell that goes off once  have several smaller school bells that go off in different places and different times  distribute the traffic through the corridors.  It solves the same problem  but instead of spending several million pounds  you spend several hundred pounds. Now  it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job  but you're not. You're actually making yourself more useful. Architects are actually really  really good at this kind of resourceful  strategic thinking. And the problem is that  like a lot of design professions  we got fixated on the idea of providing a particular kind of consumer product  and I don't think that needs to be the case anymore. The second idea worth questioning is this   th century thing that mass architecture is about big    big buildings and big finance. Actually  we've got ourselves locked into this Industrial Era mindset which says that the only people who can make cities are large organizations or corporations who build on our behalf  procuring whole neighborhoods in single  monolithic projects  and of course  form follows finance. So what you end up with are single  monolithic neighborhoods based on this kind of one size fits all model. And a lot of people can't even afford them. But what if  actually  it's possible now for cities to be made not just by the few with a lot but also by the many with a bit  And when they do  they bring with them a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live. And it raises really interesting questions about  how will we plan cities  How will finance development  How will we sell design services  What would it mean for democratic societies to offer their citizens a right to build  And in a way it should be kind of obvious  right  that in the   st century  maybe cities can be developed by citizens. And thirdly  we need to remember that  from a strictly economic point of view  design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly    mostly it's done by amateurs. And that's a good thing. Most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy in what's called the social economy or the core economy  which is people doing it for themselves. And the problem is that  up until now  it was the monetary economy which had all the infrastructure and all the tools. So the challenge we face is  how are we going to build the tools  the infrastructure and the institutions for architecture's social economy  And that began with open source software. And over the last few years  it's been moving into the physical world with open source hardware  which are freely shared blueprints that anyone can download and make for themselves. And that's where  D printing gets really  really interesting. Right  When suddenly you had a  D printer that was open source  the parts for which could be made on another  D printer. Or the same idea here  which is for a CNC machine  which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood. What these technologies are doing is radically lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill. They're challenging the idea that if you want something to be affordable it's got to be one size fits all. And they're distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities. We're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere  and increasingly that means that the design team is everyone. That really is an industrial revolution. And when we think that the major ideological conflicts that we inherited were all based around this question of who should control the means of production  and these technologies are coming back with a solution  actually  maybe no one. All of us. And we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture. So about a year and a half ago  we started working on a project called WikiHouse  and WikiHouse is an open source construction system. And the idea is to make it possible for anyone to go online  access a freely shared library of  D models which they can download and adapt in  at the moment  SketchUp  because it's free  and it's easy to use  and almost at the click of a switch they can generate a set of cutting files which allow them  in effect  to print out the parts from a house using a CNC machine and a standard sheet material like plywood. And the parts are all numbered  and basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit. And it goes together without any bolts. It uses wedge and peg connections. And even the mallets to make it can be provided on the cutting sheets as well. And a team of about two or three people  working together  can build this. They don't need any traditional construction skills. They don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that  and they can build a small house of about this size in about a day. And what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house onto which you can then apply systems like windows and cladding and insulation and services based on what's cheap and what's available. Of course  the house is never finished. We're shifting our heads here  so the house is not a finished product. With the CNC machine  you can make new parts for it over its life or even use it to make the house next door. So we can begin to see the seed of a completely open source  citizen led urban development model  potentially. And we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now  and some really interesting lessons here. One of them is that it's always incredibly sociable. People get confused between construction work and having fun. But the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane  physical details. Like  never designing a piece that can't be lifted up. Or  when you're designing a piece  make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round  or  if you do  it doesn't matter  because it's symmetrical. Probably the principal which runs deepest with us is the principal set out by Linus Torvalds  the open source pioneer  which was that idea of   Be lazy like a fox.  Don't reinvent the wheel every time. Take what already works  and adapt it for your own needs. Contrary to almost everything that you might get taught at an architecture school  copying is good. Which is appropriate  because actually  this approach is not innovative. It's actually how we built buildings for hundreds of years before the Industrial Revolution in these sorts of community barn raisings. The only difference between traditional vernacular architecture and open source architecture might be a web connection  but it's a really  really big difference. We shared the whole of WikiHouse under a Creative Commons license  and now what's just beginning to happen is that groups around the world are beginning to take it and use it and hack it and tinker with it  and it's amazing. There's a cool group over in Christchurch in New Zealand looking at post earthquake development housing  and thanks to the TED city Prize  we're working with an awesome group in one of Rio's favelas to set up a kind of community factory and micro university. These are very  very small beginnings  and actually there's more people in the last week who have got in touch and they're not even on this map. I hope next time you see it  you won't even be able to see the map. We're aware that WikiHouse is a very  very small answer  but it's a small answer to a really  really big question  which is that globally  right now  the fastest growing cities are not skyscraper cities. They're self made cities in one form or another. If we're talking about the   st century city  these are the guys who are going to be making it. You know  like it or not  welcome to the world's biggest design team. So if we're serious about problems like climate change  urbanization and health  actually  our existing development models aren't going to do it. As I think Robert Neuwirth said  there isn't a bank or a corporation or a government or an NGO who's going to be able to do it if we treat citizens only as consumers. How extraordinary would it be  though  if collectively we were to develop solutions not just to the problem of structure that we've been working on  but to infrastructure problems like solar powered air conditioning  off grid energy  off grid sanitation    low cost  open source  high performance solutions that anyone can very  very easily make  and to put them all into a commons where they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone  A kind of Wikipedia for stuff  And once something's in the commons  it will always be there. How much would that change the rules  And I think the technology's on our side. If design's great project in the   th century was the democratization of consumption    that was Henry Ford  Levittown  Coca Cola  IKEA   I think design's great project in the   st century is the democratization of production. And when it comes to architecture in cities  that really matters. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hi  everybody. Ban gap seum ni da. I'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life. I might look successful and happy being in front of you today  but I once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair. The violin  which meant everything to me  became a grave burden on me. Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me  their words sounded like meaningless noise. When I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering  I started to rediscover the true power of music. In the midst of hardship  it was the music that gave me    that restored my soul. The comfort the music gave me was just indescribable  and it was a real eye opening experience for me too  and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist. Do you feel like you are all alone  I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart  as it did for me. Thank you. Now  I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries. My audience is anyone who is here to listen  even those who are not familiar with classical music. I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center  but also hospitals  churches  prisons  and restricted facilities for leprosy patients  just to mention a few. Now  with my last piece  I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun  exciting  and that it can rock you. Let me introduce you to my brand new project   Baroque in Rock   which became a golden disc most recently. It's such an honor for me. I think  while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician  I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined. But it's now your turn. Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world. Just play your life with all you have  and share it with the world. I really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you  TEDsters. Play your life  and stay tuned. I'm almost like a crazy evangelical. I've always known that the age of design is upon us  almost like a rapture. If the day is sunny  I think   Oh  the gods have had a good design day.  Or  I go to a show and I see a beautiful piece by an artist  particularly beautiful  I say he's so good because he clearly looked to design to understand what he needed to do. So I really do believe that design is the highest form of creative expression. That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design  and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture  is still posters  is still fast cars  what you see at MoMA today. But in truth  what I really would like to explain to the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that the most interesting chairs are the ones that are actually made by a robot  like this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij  where a robot deposits a toothpaste like slur of recycled refrigerator parts  as if he were a big candy  and makes a chair out of it. Or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time and that become part of our identity. I want people to understand that design is so much more than cute chairs  that it is first and foremost everything that is around us in our life. And it's interesting how so much of what we're talking about tonight is not simply design but interaction design. And in fact  interaction design is what I've been trying to insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art for a few years  starting not very timidly but just pointedly with works  for instance  by Martin Wattenberg    the way a machine plays chess with itself  that you see here  or Lisa Strausfeld and her partners  the Sugar interface for One Laptop Per Child  Toshio Iwai's Tenori On musical instruments  and Philip Worthington's Shadow Monsters  and John Maeda's Reactive Books  and also Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's I Want You To Want Me. These were some of the first acquisitions that really introduced the idea of interaction design to the public. But more recently  I've been trying really to go even deeper into interaction design with examples that are emotionally really suggestive and that really explain interaction design at a level that is almost undeniable. The Wind Map  by Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi gas  I don't know if you've ever seen it    it's really fantastic. It looks at the territory of the United States as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds and that is really giving you a pictorial image of what's going on with the winds in the United States. But also  more recently  we started acquiring video games  and that's where all hell broke loose in a really interesting way.  Laughter  There are still people that believe that there's a high and there's a low. And that's really what I find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the anointment of video games in the MoMA collection. We've    No  first of all  New York Magazine always gets it. I love them. So we are in the right quadrant. We are in the Highbrow    that's daring  that's courageous    and Brilliant  which is great. Timidly  we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations  but it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good.  Laughter  But here comes the art critic. Oh  that was fantastic. So the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian.  Sorry  MoMA  video games are not art.  Did I ever say they were art  I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.  Exhibiting Pac Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh     They're two floors away.  Laughter     will mean game over for any real understanding of art.  I'm bringing in the end of the world. You know  We were talking about the rapture  It's coming. And Jonathan Jones is making it happen. So the same Guardian rebuts   Are video games art  the debate that shouldn't be. Last week  Guardian art critic blah blah suggested that games cannot qualify as art. But is he right  And does it matter   Thank you. Does it matter  You know  it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art  or the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to aspire to  would like to be called  artists. No. Designers aspire to be really great designers. Thank you very much. And that's more than enough. So my knight in shining armor  John Maeda  without any prompt  came out with this big declaration on why video games belong in the MoMA. And that was fantastic. And I thought that was it. But then there was another wonderfully pretentious article that came out in The New Republic  so pretentious  by Liel Leibovitz  and it said   MoMA has mistaken video games for art.  Again.  The museum is putting Pac Man alongside Picasso.  Again.  That misses the point.  Excuse me. You're missing the point. And here  look  the above question is put bluntly   Are video games art  No. Video games aren't art because they are quite thoroughly something else  code.  Oh  so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right  So it's so fantastic to see how these feathers that were ruffled  and these reactions  were so vehement. And you know what  The International Cat Video Film Festival didn't have that much of a reaction.  Laughter  I think this was truly fantastic. We were talking about dancing ponies  but I was really jealous of the Walker Arts Center for putting up this festival  because it's very  very wonderful. And there's this Flaubert quote that I love   I have always tried to live in an ivory tower  but a tide of shit is beating at its walls  threatening to undermine it.  I consider myself the tide of shit. You know  we have to go through that. Even in the     s  my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the customs officers that decided they were not art. So it's happened before  and it will happen in the future  but right now I can tell you that I am so  so proud to be able to call Pac Man part of the MoMA collection. And the same with  for instance  Tetris  original version  the Soviet one. And you know  the amount of work    yeah  Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government and that's how he developed Tetris  and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube that makes it look slightly bombed. And it's fantastic. So behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work  because we're still the Museum of Modern Art  so even when we tackle popular culture  we tackle it as a form of interaction design and as something that has to go into the collection at MoMA  therefore  has to be researched. So to get to choosing Eric Chahi's wonderful Another World  amongst others  we put together a panel of experts  and we worked on this acquisition  and it's mostly myself and Kate Carmody and Paul Galloway. We worked on it for a year and a half. So many people helped us   designers of games  you might know Jamin Warren and his collaborators at Kill Screen magazine  and you know  Kevin Slavin. You name it. We bugged everybody  because we knew that we were ignorant. We were not real gamers enough  so we had to really talk to them. And so we decided  of course  to have Sim City       not the other Sim City  that one in particular  so the criteria that we developed along the way were really strong  and were not only criteria of selection. They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation. That's what makes this acquisition more than a little game or a little joke. It's truly a way to think of how to preserve and show artifacts that will more and more become part of our lives in the future. We live today  as you know very well  not in the digital  not in the physical  but in the kind of minestrone that our mind makes of the two. And that's really where interaction lies  and that's the importance of interaction. And in order to explain interaction  we need to really bring people in and make them realize how interaction is part of their lives. So when I talk about it  I don't talk only about video games  which are in a way the purest form of interaction  unadulterated by any kind of function or finality. I also talk about the MetroCard vending machine  which I consider a masterpiece of interaction. I mean  that interface is beautiful. It looks like a burly MTA guy coming out of the tunnel. You know  with your mitt you can actually paw the MetroCard  and I talk about how bad ATM machines usually are. So I let people understand that it's up to them to know how to judge interaction so as to know when it's good or when it's bad. So when I show The Sims  I try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with The Sims  not only the fun but also the responsibility that came with the Tamagotchi. You know  video games can be truly deep even when they're completely mindless. I'm sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy. It's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can in a finite amount of time and hopefully you'll be able to make it into a planet. I've never made it into a planet  but that's it. Or  you know  Vib Ribbon was not distributed here in the United States. It was a PlayStation game  but mostly for Japan. And it was one of the first video games in which you could choose your own music. So you would put into the PlayStation  you would put your own CD  and then the game would change alongside your music. So really fantastic. Not to mention Eve Online. Eve Online is an artificial universe  if you wish  but one of the diplomats that was killed in Benghazi  not Ambassador Stevens  but one of his collaborators  was a really big shot in Eve Online  so here you have a diplomat in the real world that spends his time in Eve Online to kind of test  maybe  all of his ideas about diplomacy and about universe building  and to the point that the first announcement of the bombing was actually given on Eve Online  and after his death  several parts of the universe were named after him. And I was just recently at the Eve Online fan festival in Reykjav k that was quite amazing. I mean  we're talking about an experience that of course can seem weird to many  but that is very educational. Of course  there are games that are even more educational. Dwarf Fortress is like the holy grail of this kind of massive multiplayer online game  and in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjav k  and they were greeted by a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans. It was amazing to see. And it's a beautiful game. So you start seeing here that the aesthetics that are so important to a museum collection like MoMA's are kept alive also by the selection of these games. And you know  Valve    you know  Portal    is an example of a video game in which you have a certain type of violence which also leads me to talk about one of the biggest issues that we had to discuss when we acquired the video games  what to do with violence. Right  We had to make decisions. At MoMA  interestingly  there's a lot of violence depicted in the art part of the collection  but when I came to MoMA    years ago  and as an Italian  I said   You know what  we need a Beretta.  And I was told   No. No guns in the design collection.  And I was like   Why   Interestingly  I learned that it's considered that in design and in the design collection  what you see is what you get. So when you see a gun  it's an instrument for killing in the design collection. If it's in the art collection  it might be a critique of the killing instrument. So it's very interesting. But we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design  so maybe one day we'll be able to acquire also the guns. But here  in this particular case  we decided  you know  with Kate and Paul  that we would have no gratuitous violence. So we have Portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces. We have Street Fighter II  because martial arts are good. But we don't have GTA because  maybe it's my own reflection  I've never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps. So it was not very constructive.  Laughter  So  I'm making fun of it  but we discussed this for so many days. You have no idea. And to this day  I am ambivalent  but when you have instead games like Flow  there's no doubt. It's like  it's about serenity and it's about sublime. It's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature. Then we have a few also side scrollers    classical ones. So it's quite a hefty collection. And right now  we started with the first     but we have several that are coming up  and the reason why we haven't acquired them yet is because you don't acquire just the game. You acquire the relationship with the company. What we want  what we aspire to  is the code. It's very hard to get  of course. But that's what would enable us to preserve the video games for a really long time  and that's what museums do. They also preserve artifacts for posterity. In absence of the code  because  you know  video game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases  in absence of that  we acquire the relationship with the company. We're going to stay with them forever. They're not going to get rid of us. And one day  we'll get that code.  Laughter  But I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose for interaction design. Aesthetics are really important. And I'm showing you Core War here  which is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically of the limitations of the processor. So the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness  which is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important. And so is space  the spatial aspect of games. You know  I feel that the best video games are the ones that have really savvy architects that are behind them  and if they're not architects  bona fide trained in architecture  they have that feeling. But the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important. Time. The way we experience time in video games  as in other forms of interaction design  is really quite amazing. It can be real time or it can be the time within the game  as is in Animal Crossing  where seasons follow each other at their own pace. So time  space  aesthetics  and then  most important  behavior. The real core issue of interaction design is behavior. Designers that deal with interaction design behaviors that go to influence the rest of our lives. They're not just limited to our interaction with the screen. In this case  I'm showing you Marble Madness  which is a beautiful game in which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you  so you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape  and the sphere  the controller itself  gives you a sense of the movement. In a way  you can see how video games are the purest aspect of interaction design and are very useful to explain what interaction is. We don't want to show the video games with the paraphernalia. No arcade nostalgia. If anything  we want to show the code  and here you see Ben Fry's distellamap of Pac Man  of the Pac Man code. So the way we acquired the games is very interesting and very unorthodox. You see them here displayed alongside other examples of design  furniture and other parts  but there's no paraphernalia  no nostalagia  only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers. The controllers are  of course  part of the experience  so you cannot do away with it. But interestingly  this choice was not condemned too vehemently by gamers. I was afraid that they would kill us  and instead they understood  especially when I told them that I was trying to apply the same stratagem that Philip Johnson applied in      when he wanted to make people understand the importance of design  and he took propeller blades and pieces of machinery and in the MoMA galleries he put them on white pedestals against white walls  as if they were Brancusi sculptures. He created this strange distance  this shock  that made people realize how gorgeous formally  and also important functionally  design pieces were. I would like to do the same with video games. By getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts and everything else that we might remember from our childhood  I want people to understand that those are important forms of design. And in a way  the video games  the fonts and everything else lead us to make people understand a wider meaning for design. One of my dream acquisitions  which has been on hold for a few years but now will come back on the front burner  is a    . I would like to acquire it  but without owning it. I don't want it to be at MoMA and possessed by MoMA. I want it to keep flying. So it's an acquisition where MoMA makes an arrangement with an airline and keeps the Boeing     flying. And the same with the     sign that we acquired a few years ago. It was the first example of an acquisition of something that is in the public domain. And what I say to people  it's almost as if a butterfly were flying by and we captured the shadow on the wall  and just we're showing the shadow. So in a way  we're showing a manifestation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have. And it's too long to explain the acquisition  but if you want to go on the MoMA blog  there's a long post where I explain why it's such a great example of design. Along the way  I've had to burn a few chairs. You know  I've had to do away with a few concepts of design past. But I see that people are coming along  that the audiences  paradoxically  are much more responsive and much more understanding of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are. Design is truly everywhere  and design is as important as anything  and I'm so glad that  because of its diversity and because of its centrality to our lives  many more people are coming to it as a profession  as a passion  and as  very simply  part of their own culture. Thank you very much. I'm going to share with you a paradigm shifting perspective on the issues of gender violence    sexual assault  domestic violence  relationship abuse  sexual harassment  sexual abuse of children. That whole range of issues that I'll refer to in shorthand as  gender violence issues   they've been seen as women's issues that some good men help out with  but I have a problem with that frame and I don't accept it. I don't see these as women's issues that some good men help out with. In fact  I'm going to argue that these are men's issues  first and foremost. Now obviously  they're also women's issues  so I appreciate that  but calling gender violence a women's issue is part of the problem  for a number of reasons. The first is that it gives men an excuse not to pay attention. Right  A lot of men hear the term  women's issues  and we tend to tune it out  and we think   Hey  I'm a guy. That's for the girls   or  That's for the women.  And a lot of men literally don't get beyond the first sentence as a result. It's almost like a chip in our brain is activated  and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the term  women's issues.  This is also true  by the way  of the word  gender   because a lot of people hear the word  gender  and they think it means  women.  So they think that gender issues is synonymous with women's issues. There's some confusion about the term gender. And actually  let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy. So let's talk for a moment about race. In the U.S.  when we hear the word  race   a lot of people think that means African American  Latino  Asian American  Native American  South Asian  Pacific Islander  on and on. A lot of people  when they hear the word  sexual orientation  think it means gay  lesbian  bisexual. And a lot of people  when they hear the word  gender   think it means women. In each case  the dominant group doesn't get paid attention to. Right  As if white people don't have some sort of racial identity or belong to some racial category or construct  as if heterosexual people don't have a sexual orientation  as if men don't have a gender. This is one of the ways that dominant systems maintain and reproduce themselves  which is to say the dominant group is rarely challenged to even think about its dominance  because that's one of the key characteristics of power and privilege  the ability to go unexamined  lacking introspection  in fact being rendered invisible in large measure in the discourse about issues that are primarily about us. And this is amazing how this works in domestic and sexual violence  how men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation about a subject that is centrally about men. And I'm going to illustrate what I'm talking about by using the old tech. I'm old school on some fundamental regards. I work with    I make films    and I work with high tech  but I'm still old school as an educator  and I want to share with you this exercise that illustrates on the sentence structure level how the way that we think  literally the way that we use language  conspires to keep our attention off of men. This is about domestic violence in particular  but you can plug in other analogues. This comes from the work of the feminist linguist Julia Penelope. It starts with a very basic English sentence   John beat Mary.  That's a good English sentence. John is the subject. Beat is the verb. Mary is the object. Good sentence. Now we're going to move to the second sentence  which says the same thing in the passive voice.  Mary was beaten by John.  And now a whole lot has happened in one sentence. We've gone from  John beat Mary  to  Mary was beaten by John.  We've shifted our focus in one sentence from John to Mary  and you can see John is very close to the end of the sentence  well  close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain. The third sentence  John is dropped  and we have   Mary was beaten   and now it's all about Mary. We're not even thinking about John. It's totally focused on Mary. Over the past generation  the term we've used synonymous with  beaten  is  battered   so we have  Mary was battered.  And the final sentence in this sequence  flowing from the others  is   Mary is a battered woman.  So now Mary's very identity    Mary is a battered woman    is what was done to her by John in the first instance. But we've demonstrated that John has long ago left the conversation. Now  those of us who work in the domestic and sexual violence field know that victim blaming is pervasive in this realm  which is to say  blaming the person to whom something was done rather than the person who did it. And we say things like  why do these women go out with these men  Why are they attracted to these men  Why do they keep going back  What was she wearing at that party  What a stupid thing to do. Why was she drinking with that group of guys in that hotel room  This is victim blaming  and there are numerous reasons for it  but one of them is that our whole cognitive structure is set up to blame victims. This is all unconscious. Our whole cognitive structure is set up to ask questions about women and women's choices and what they're doing  thinking  and wearing. And I'm not going to shout down people who ask questions about women  okay  It's a legitimate thing to ask. But's let's be clear  Asking questions about Mary is not going to get us anywhere in terms of preventing violence. We have to ask a different set of questions. You can see where I'm going with this  right  The questions are not about Mary. They're about John. The questions include things like  why does John beat Mary  Why is domestic violence still a big problem in the United States and all over the world  What's going on  Why do so many men abuse  physically  emotionally  verbally  and other ways  the women and girls  and the men and boys  that they claim to love  What's going on with men  Why do so many adult men sexually abuse little girls and little boys  Why is that a common problem in our society and all over the world today  Why do we hear over and over again about new scandals erupting in major institutions like the Catholic Church or the Penn State football program or the Boy Scouts of America  on and on and on  And then local communities all over the country and all over the world  right  We hear about it all the time. The sexual abuse of children. What's going on with men  Why do so many men rape women in our society and around the world  Why do so many men rape other men  What is going on with men  And then what is the role of the various institutions in our society that are helping to produce abusive men at pandemic rates  Because this isn't about individual perpetrators. That's a naive way to understanding what is a much deeper and more systematic social problem. You know  the perpetrators aren't these monsters who crawl out of the swamp and come into town and do their nasty business and then retreat into the darkness. That's a very naive notion  right  Perpetrators are much more normal than that  and everyday than that. So the question is  what are we doing here in our society and in the world  What are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce abusive men  What's the role of religious belief systems  the sports culture  the pornography culture  the family structure  economics  and how that intersects  and race and ethnicity and how that intersects  How does all this work  And then  once we start making those kinds of connections and asking those important and big questions  then we can talk about how we can be transformative  in other words  how can we do something differently  How can we change the practices  How can we change the socialization of boys and the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes  These are the kind of questions that we need to be asking and the kind of work that we need to be doing  but if we're endlessly focused on what women are doing and thinking in relationships or elsewhere  we're not going to get to that piece. Now  I understand that a lot of women who have been trying to speaking out about these issues  today and yesterday and for years and years  often get shouted down for their efforts. They get called nasty names like  male basher  and  man hater   and the disgusting and offensive  feminazi.  Right  And you know what all this is about  It's called kill the messenger. It's because the women who are standing up and speaking out for themselves and for other women as well as for men and boys  it's a statement to them to sit down and shut up  keep the current system in place  because we don't like it when people rock the boat. We don't like it when people challenge our power. You'd better sit down and shut up  basically. And thank goodness that women haven't done that. Thank goodness that we live in a world where there's so much women's leadership that can counteract that. But one of the powerful roles that men can play in this work is that we can say some things that sometimes women can't say  or  better yet  we can be heard saying some things that women often can't be heard saying. Now  I appreciate that that's a problem. It's sexism. But it's the truth. And so one of the things that I say to men  and my colleagues and I always say this  is we need more men who have the courage and the strength to start standing up and saying some of this stuff  and standing with women and not against them and pretending that somehow this is a battle between the sexes and other kinds of nonsense. We live in the world together. And by the way  one of the things that really bothers me about some of the rhetoric against feminists and others who have built the battered women's and rape crisis movements around the world is that somehow  like I said  that they're anti male. What about all the boys who are profoundly affected in a negative way by what some adult man is doing against their mother  themselves  their sisters  What about all those boys  What about all the young men and boys who have been traumatized by adult men's violence  You know what  The same system that produces men who abuse women produces men who abuse other men. And if we want to talk about male victims  let's talk about male victims. Most male victims of violence are the victims of other men's violence. So that's something that both women and men have in common. We are both victims of men's violence. So we have it in our direct self interest  not to mention the fact that most men that I know have women and girls that we care deeply about  in our families and our friendship circles and every other way. So there's so many reasons why we need men to speak out. It seems obvious saying it out loud. Doesn't it  Now  the nature of the work that I do and my colleagues do in the sports culture and the U.S. military  in schools  we pioneered this approach called the bystander approach to gender violence prevention. And I just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach  because it's a big thematic shift  although there's lots of particulars  but the heart of it is  instead of seeing men as perpetrators and women as victims  or women as perpetrators  men as victims  or any combination in there. I'm using the gender binary. I know there's more than men and women  there's more than male and female. And there are women who are perpetrators  and of course there are men who are victims. There's a whole spectrum. But instead of seeing it in the binary fashion  we focus on all of us as what we call bystanders  and a bystander is defined as anybody who is not a perpetrator or a victim in a given situation  so in other words friends  teammates  colleagues  coworkers  family members  those of us who are not directly involved in a dyad of abuse  but we are embedded in social  family  work  school  and other peer culture relationships with people who might be in that situation. What do we do  How do we speak up  How do we challenge our friends  How do we support our friends  But how do we not remain silent in the face of abuse  Now  when it comes to men and male culture  the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are. And when I say abusive  I don't mean just men who are beating women. We're not just saying a man whose friend is abusing his girlfriend needs to stop the guy at the moment of attack. That's a naive way of creating a social change. It's along a continuum  we're trying to get men to interrupt each other. So  for example  if you're a guy and you're in a group of guys playing poker  talking  hanging out  no women present  and another guy says something sexist or degrading or harassing about women  instead of laughing along or pretending you didn't hear it  we need men to say   Hey  that's not funny. You know  that could be my sister you're talking about  and could you joke about something else  Or could you talk about something else  I don't appreciate that kind of talk.  Just like if you're a white person and another white person makes a racist comment  you'd hope  I hope  that white people would interrupt that racist enactment by a fellow white person. Just like with heterosexism  if you're a heterosexual person and you yourself don't enact harassing or abusive behaviors towards people of varying sexual orientations  if you don't say something in the face of other heterosexual people doing that  then  in a sense  isn't your silence a form of consent and complicity  Well  the bystander approach is trying to give people tools to interrupt that process and to speak up and to create a peer culture climate where the abusive behavior will be seen as unacceptable  not just because it's illegal  but because it's wrong and unacceptable in the peer culture. And if we can get to the place where men who act out in sexist ways will lose status  young men and boys who act out in sexist and harassing ways towards girls and women  as well as towards other boys and men  will lose status as a result of it  guess what  We'll see a radical diminution of the abuse. Because the typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted. He's a normal guy in every other way. Isn't he  Now  among the many great things that Martin Luther King said in his short life was   In the end  what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends.  In the end  what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends. There's been an awful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of men's violence against women and children  hasn't there  There's been an awful lot of silence. And all I'm saying is that we need to break that silence  and we need more men to do that. Now  it's easier said than done  because I'm saying it now  but I'm telling you it's not easy in male culture for guys to challenge each other  which is one of the reasons why part of the paradigm shift that has to happen is not just understanding these issues as men's issues  but they're also leadership issues for men. Because ultimately  the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues should not fall on the shoulders of little boys or teenage boys in high school or college men. It should be on adult men with power. Adult men with power are the ones we need to be holding accountable for being leaders on these issues  because when somebody speaks up in a peer culture and challenges and interrupts  he or she is being a leader  really  right  But on a big scale  we need more adult men with power to start prioritizing these issues  and we haven't seen that yet  have we  Now  I was at a dinner a number of years ago  and I work extensively with the U.S. military  all the services. And I was at this dinner and this woman said to me    I think she thought she was a little clever    she said   So how long have you been doing sensitivity training with the Marines   And I said   With all due respect  I don't do sensitivity training with the Marines. I run a leadership program in the Marine Corps.  Now  I know it's a bit pompous  my response  but it's an important distinction  because I don't believe that what we need is sensitivity training. We need leadership training  because  for example  when a professional coach or a manager of a baseball team or a football team    and I work extensively in that realm as well    makes a sexist comment  makes a homophobic statement  makes a racist comment  there will be discussions on the sports blogs and in sports talk radio. And some people will say   Well  he needs sensitivity training.  And other people will say   Well get off it. You know  that's political correctness run amok  and he made a stupid statement. Move on.  My argument is  he doesn't need sensitivity training. He needs leadership training  because he's being a bad leader  because in a society with gender diversity and sexual diversity    and racial and ethnic diversity  you make those kind of comments  you're failing at your leadership. If we can make this point that I'm making to powerful men and women in our society at all levels of institutional authority and power  it's going to change  it's going to change the paradigm of people's thinking. You know  for example  I work a lot in college and university athletics throughout North America. We know so much about how to prevent domestic and sexual violence  right  There's no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes  coaches  administrators  as part of their educational process. We know enough to know that we can easily do that. But you know what's missing  The leadership. But it's not the leadership of student athletes. It's the leadership of the athletic director  the president of the university  the people in charge who make decisions about resources and who make decisions about priorities in the institutional settings. That's a failure  in most cases  of men's leadership. Look at Penn State. Penn State is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach. You had so many situations in that realm where men in powerful positions failed to act to protect children  in this case  boys. It's unbelievable  really. But when you get into it  you realize there are pressures on men. There are constraints within peer cultures on men  which is why we need to encourage men to break through those pressures. And one of the ways to do that is to say there's an awful lot of men who care deeply about these issues. I know this. I work with men  and I've been working with tens of thousands  hundreds of thousands of men for many  many decades now. It's scary  when you think about it  how many years. But there's so many men who care deeply about these issues  but caring deeply is not enough. We need more men with the guts  with the courage  with the strength  with the moral integrity to break our complicit silence and challenge each other and stand with women and not against them. By the way  we owe it to women. There's no question about it. But we also owe it to our sons. We also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world in situations where they didn't make the choice to be a man in a culture that tells them that manhood is a certain way. They didn't make the choice. We that have a choice have an opportunity and a responsibility to them as well. I hope that  going forward  men and women  working together  can begin the change and the transformation that will happen so that future generations won't have the level of tragedy that we deal with on a daily basis. I know we can do it. We can do better. Thank you very much.  Applause  When I was a young boy  I used to gaze through the microscope of my father at the insects in amber that he kept in the house. And they were remarkably well preserved  morphologically just phenomenal. And we used to imagine that someday  they would actually come to life and they would crawl out of the resin  and  if they could  they would fly away. If you had asked me    years ago whether or not we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals  I would have told you  it's unlikely. If you had asked whether or not we would actually be able to revive an extinct species  I would have said  pipe dream. But I'm actually standing here today  amazingly  to tell you that not only is the sequencing of extinct genomes a possibility  actually a modern day reality  but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach  maybe not from the insects in amber    in fact  this mosquito was actually used for the inspiration for  Jurassic Park    but from woolly mammoths  the well preserved remains of woolly mammoths in the permafrost. Woollies are a particularly interesting  quintessential image of the Ice Age. They were large. They were hairy. They had large tusks  and we seem to have a very deep connection with them  like we do with elephants. Maybe it's because elephants share many things in common with us. They bury their dead. They educate the next of kin. They have social knits that are very close. Or maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time  because elephants  like us  share their origins in Africa some seven million years ago  and as habitats changed and environments changed  we actually  like the elephants  migrated out into Europe and Asia. So the first large mammoth that appears on the scene is meridionalis  which was standing four meters tall weighing about    tons  and was a woodland adapted species and spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia  across the Bering land bridge and into parts of North America. And then  again  as climate changed as it always does  and new habitats opened up  we had the arrival of a steppe adapted species called trogontherii in Central Asia pushing meridionalis out into Western Europe. And the open grassland savannas of North America opened up  leading to the Columbian mammoth  a large  hairless species in North America. And it was really only about         years later that we had the arrival of the woolly  the one that we all know and love so much  spreading from an East Beringian point of origin across Central Asia  again pushing the trogontherii out through Central Europe  and over hundreds of thousands of years migrating back and forth across the Bering land bridge during times of glacial peaks and coming into direct contact with the Columbian relatives living in the south  and there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years during traumatic climatic shifts. So there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions in temperature and environment  and doing very  very well. And there they survive on the mainland until about        years ago  and actually  surprisingly  on the small islands off of Siberia and Alaska until about       years ago. So Egyptians are building pyramids and woollies are still living on islands. And then they disappear. Like    percent of all the animals that have once lived  they go extinct  likely due to a warming climate and fast encroaching dense forests that are migrating north  and also  as the late  great Paul Martin once put it  probably Pleistocene overkill  so the large game hunters that took them down. Fortunately  we find millions of their remains strewn across the permafrost buried deep in Siberia and Alaska  and we can actually go up there and actually take them out. And the preservation is  again  like those insects in  amber   phenomenal. So you have teeth  bones with blood which look like blood  you have hair  and you have intact carcasses or heads which still have brains in them. So the preservation and the survival of DNA depends on many factors  and I have to admit  most of which we still don't quite understand  but depending upon when an organism dies and how quickly he's buried  the depth of that burial  the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment  will ultimately dictate how long DNA will survive over geologically meaningful time frames. And it's probably surprising to many of you sitting in this room that it's not the time that matters  it's not the length of preservation  it's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most. So if we were to go deep now within the bones and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process  the DNA which was once intact  tightly wrapped around histone proteins  is now under attack by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth for years during its lifetime. So those bacteria  along with the environmental bacteria  free water and oxygen  actually break apart the DNA into smaller and smaller and smaller DNA fragments  until all you have are fragments that range from    base pairs to  in the best case scenarios  a few hundred base pairs in length. So most fossils out there in the fossil record are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures. But a few of them actually have DNA fragments that survive for thousands  even a few millions of years in time. And using state of the art clean room technology  we've devised ways that we can actually pull these DNAs away from all the rest of the gunk in there  and it's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room that if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth and I extract its DNA that I'll get mammoth DNA  but I'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth  and  more complicated  I'll get all the DNA that survived in that environment with it  so the bacteria  the fungi  and so on and so forth. Not surprising then again that a mammoth preserved in the permafrost will have something on the order of    percent of its DNA being mammoth  whereas something like the Columbian mammoth  living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment over its laying in will only have   to    percent endogenous. But we've come up with very clever ways that we can actually discriminate  capture and discriminate  the mammoth from the non mammoth DNA  and with the advances in high throughput sequencing  we can actually pull out and bioinformatically re jig all these small mammoth fragments and place them onto a backbone of an Asian or African elephant chromosome. And so by doing that  we can actually get all the little points that discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant  and what do we know  then  about a mammoth  Well  the mammoth genome is almost at full completion  and we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth. So a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs  but an elephant and mammoth genome is about two billion base pairs larger  and most of that is composed of small  repetitive DNAs that make it very difficult to actually re jig the entire structure of the genome. So having this information allows us to answer one of the interesting relationship questions between mammoths and their living relatives  the African and the Asian elephant  all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago  but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share a most recent common ancestor with Asian elephants about six million years ago  so slightly closer to the Asian elephant. With advances in ancient DNA technology  we can actually now start to begin to sequence the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned  and I just wanted to talk about two of them  the woolly and the Columbian mammoth  both of which were living very close to each other during glacial peaks  so when the glaciers were massive in North America  the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones  and came into contact with the relatives living to the south  and there they shared refugia  and a little bit more than the refugia  it turns out. It looks like they were interbreeding. And that this is not an uncommon feature in Proboscideans  because it turns out that large savanna male elephants will outcompete the smaller forest elephants for their females. So large  hairless Columbians outcompeting the smaller male woollies. It reminds me a bit of high school  unfortunately. So this is not trivial  given the idea that we want to revive extinct species  because it turns out that an African and an Asian elephant can actually interbreed and have live young  and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo in Chester  U.K.  in     . So that means that we can actually take Asian elephant chromosomes  modify them into all those positions we've actually now been able to discriminate with the mammoth genome  we can put that into an enucleated cell  differentiate that into a stem cell  subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm  artificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg  and over a long and arduous procedure  actually bring back something that looks like this. Now  this wouldn't be an exact replica  because the short DNA fragments that I told you about will prevent us from building the exact structure  but it would make something that looked and felt very much like a woolly mammoth did. Now  when I bring up this with my friends  we often talk about  well  where would you put it  Where are you going to house a mammoth  There's no climates or habitats suitable. Well  that's not actually the case. It turns out that there are swaths of habitat in the north of Siberia and Yukon that actually could house a mammoth. Remember  this was a highly plastic animal that lived over tremendous climate variation. So this landscape would be easily able to house it  and I have to admit that there  is  a part of the child in me  the boy in me  that would love to see these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost of the north once again  but I do have to admit that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders whether or not we should. Thank you very much. Ryan Phelan  Don't go away. You've left us with a question. I'm sure everyone is asking this. When you say   Should we   it feels like you're reticent there  and yet you've given us a vision of it being so possible. What's your reticence  Hendrik Poinar  I don't think it's reticence. I think it's just that we have to think very deeply about the implications  ramifications of our actions  and so as long as we have good  deep discussion like we're having now  I think we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it. But I just want to make sure that we spend time thinking about why we're doing it first. RP  Perfect. Perfect answer. Thank you very much  Hendrik. HP  Thank you.  Applause  So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan  China in the     s. When I was in the first grade  the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes  all expenses paid. But my tiger mother said   No.  My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them. After surviving the Cultural Revolution  they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness  a safe and well paid job. It is not important if I like the job or not. But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer. That is me playing my imaginary piano. An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics  so I tried everything I could to go to opera school. I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show. But no adults liked the idea. No adults believed I was serious. Only my friends supported me  but they were kids  just as powerless as I was. So at age     I knew I was too old to be trained. My dream would never come true. I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second class happiness would be the best I could hope for. But that's so unfair. So I was determined to find another calling. Nobody around to teach me  Fine. I turned to books. I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.  Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei   I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience.  Jane Eyre   And I learned to be efficient from this book.  Cheaper by the Dozen   And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.   Complete Works of Sanmao   aka Echo Chan     Lessons From History  by Nan Huaijin  I came to the U.S. in       so which books did I read here first  Books banned in China  of course.  The Good Earth  is about Chinese peasant life. That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it. The Bible is interesting  but strange. That's a topic for a different day. But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany   You shall honor your father and mother.   Honor   I said.  That's so different  and better  than obey.  So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading. It offers many insights. For example  I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with. It had never occurred to me  China doesn't have to be at the center of the world. A map actually carries somebody's view. Comparative reading actually is nothing new. It's a standard practice in the academic world. There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature. Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic. So I thought  well  if comparative reading works for research  why not do it in daily life too  So I started reading books in pairs. So they can be about people      Benjamin Franklin  by Walter Isaacson   John Adams  by David McCullough     who are involved in the same event  or friends with shared experiences.   Personal History  by Katharine Graham   The Snowball  Warren Buffett and the Business of Life   by Alice Schroeder  I also compare the same stories in different genres     Laughter   Holy Bible  King James Version   Lamb  by Chrisopher Moore     or similar stories from different cultures  as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.  The Power of Myth  by Joseph Campbell  For example  both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations. For the Christ  the temptations are economic  political and spiritual. For the Buddha  they are all psychological  lust  fear and social duty    interesting. So if you know a foreign language  it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.   The Way of Chuang Tzu  Thomas Merton   Tao  The Watercourse Way  Alan Watts  Instead of lost in translation  I found there is much to gain. For example  it's through translation that I realized  happiness  in Chinese literally means  fast joy.  Huh   Bride  in Chinese literally means  new mother.  Uh oh. Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present. I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again. Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered. I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream. Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from  where passion comes from  where happiness comes from. Even a shattered dream can do that for you. So because of books  I'm here today  happy  living again with a purpose and a clarity  most of the time. So may books be always with you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause   Even in purely non religious terms  homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty. It is a pathetic little second rate substitute for reality    a pitiable flight from life. As such  it deserves no compassion  it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom  and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness.  That's from Time magazine in       when I was three years old. And last year  the president of the United States came out in favor of gay marriage. And my question is  how did we get from there to here  How did an illness become an identity  When I was perhaps six years old  I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother. And at the end of buying our shoes  the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home. My brother wanted a red balloon  and I wanted a pink balloon. My mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon. But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one. And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue. The fact that my favorite color now is blue  but I'm still gay    is evidence of both my mother's influence and its limits. When I was little  my mother used to say   The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world. And until you have children  you don't know what it's like.  And when I was little  I took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about parenting my brother and me. And when I was an adolescent  I thought that I'm gay  and so I probably can't have a family. And when she said it  it made me anxious. And after I came out of the closet  when she continued to say it  it made me furious. I said   I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in. And I want you to stop saying that.  About    years ago  I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine to write a piece about deaf culture. And I was rather taken aback. I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness. Those poor people  they couldn't hear. They lacked hearing  and what could we do for them  And then I went out into the deaf world. I went to deaf clubs. I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry. I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville  Tennessee where people complained about that slurry Southern signing. And as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world  I become convinced that deafness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said   We don't lack hearing  we have membership in a culture   were saying something that was viable. It wasn't my culture  and I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it  but I appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it  it felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture. It felt as valid perhaps even as American culture. Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf. And when her daughter was born  she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me. She was facing the question of what to do with this child. Should she say   You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter   Or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity  get involved in the Little People of America  become aware of what was happening for dwarfs  And I suddenly thought  most deaf children are born to hearing parents. Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them. Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence. Most gay people are born to straight parents. Those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world  and those gay people have to discover identity later on. And here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter. And I thought  there it is again  A family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary. And I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity. There are vertical identities  which are passed down generationally from parent to child. Those are things like ethnicity  frequently nationality  language  often religion. Those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children. And while some of them can be difficult  there's no attempt to cure them. You can argue that it's harder in the United States    our current presidency notwithstanding    to be a person of color. And yet  we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to African Americans and Asians come out with creamy skin and yellow hair. There are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group. And I call them horizontal identities  because the peer group is the horizontal experience. These are identities that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers. And those identities  those horizontal identities  people have almost always tried to cure. And I wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identities come to a good relationship with them. And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place. There's self acceptance  there's family acceptance  and there's social acceptance. And they don't always coincide. And a lot of the time  people who have these conditions are very angry because they feel as though their parents don't love them  when what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them. Love is something that ideally is there unconditionally throughout the relationship between a parent and a child. But acceptance is something that takes time. It always takes time. One of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown. When he was born  he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism  a very disabling condition  and his parents were told that he would never walk  he would never talk  he would have no intellectual capacity  and he would probably not even recognize them. And it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly. And his mother said she wasn't going to do it. And she took her son home. And even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages  she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism  and she got Clinton enrolled with him. And in the course of his childhood  he had    major surgical procedures. And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures  as a result of which he now can walk. And while he was there  they sent tutors around to help him with his school work. And he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do. And he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family. He was the first one in his family  in fact  to go to college  where he lived on campus and drove a specially fitted car that accommodated his unusual body. And his mother told me this story of coming home one day    and he went to college nearby    and she said   I saw that car  which you can always recognize  in the parking lot of a bar   she said.  Laughter   And I thought to myself  they're six feet tall  he's three feet tall. Two beers for them is four beers for him.  She said   I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him  but I went home  and I left him eight messages on his cell phone.  She said   And then I thought  if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies      And I said to her   What do you think you did that helped him to emerge as this charming  accomplished  wonderful person   And she said   What did I do  I loved him  that's all. Clinton just always had that light in him. And his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there.  I'm going to quote from another magazine of the '  s. This one is from         The Atlantic Monthly  voice of liberal America    written by an important bioethicist. He said   There is no reason to feel guilty about putting a Down syndrome child away  whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible  lethal sense. It is sad  yes    dreadful. But it carries no guilt. True guilt arises only from an offense against a person  and a Down's is not a person.  There's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made in the treatment of gay people. The fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day. But we forget how we used to see people who had other differences  how we used to see people who were disabled  how inhuman we held people to be. And the change that's been accomplished there  which is almost equally radical  is one that we pay not very much attention to. One of the families I interviewed  Tom and Karen Robards  were taken aback when  as young and successful New Yorkers  their first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome. They thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be  and so they decided they would build a little center    two classrooms that they started with a few other parents    to educate kids with D.S. And over the years  that center grew into something called the Cooke Center  where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught. In the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran  the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled. The experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors  those who are writers  some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood. The Robards had a lot to do with that. And I said   Do you regret it  Do you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome  Do you wish you'd never heard of it   And interestingly his father said   Well  for David  our son  I regret it  because for David  it's a difficult way to be in the world  and I'd like to give David an easier life. But I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome  it would be a catastrophic loss.  And Karen Robards said to me   I'm with Tom. For David  I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life. But speaking for myself    well  I would never have believed    years ago when he was born that I could come to such a point    speaking for myself  it's made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more purposeful in my whole life  that speaking for myself  I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world.  We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up. And yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before. Most deaf infants born in the United States now will receive Cochlear implants  which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver  and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech. A compound that has been tested in mice  BMN      is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene. Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism  and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene  grow to full size. Testing in humans is around the corner. There are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before  making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies  or to terminate them. And so we have both social progress and medical progress. And I believe in both of them. I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful  and I think the same thing about the medical progress. But I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other. And when I see the way they're intersecting in conditions like the three I've just described  I sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan. We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether. And a lot of the time the question of parenthood is  what do we validate in our children  and what do we cure in them  Jim Sinclair  a prominent autism activist  said   When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism ' what they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist and I had a different  non autistic child instead.' Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence. This is what we hear when you pray for a cure    that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces.  It's a very extreme point of view  but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated. They want to be whoever it is that they've come to be. One of the families I interviewed for this project was the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre. It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me  and once they agreed  they were so full of their story that they couldn't stop telling it. And the first weekend I spent with them    the first of many    I recorded more than    hours of conversation. And on Sunday night  we were all exhausted. We were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner. And I said   If Dylan were here now  do you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him   And his father said   I sure do. I'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing.  And Sue looked at the floor  and she thought for a minute. And then she looked back up and said   I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head.  When I had dinner with her a couple of years later    one of many dinners that we had together    she said   You know  when it first happened  I used to wish that I had never married  that I had never had children. If I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom  this child wouldn't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened. But I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much that I don't want to imagine a life without them. I recognize the pain they caused to others  for which there can be no forgiveness  but the pain they caused to me  there is   she said.  So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world if Dylan had never been born  I've decided that it would not have been better for me.  I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems  problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid  and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting. And then I thought  all of us who have children love the children we have  with their flaws. If some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children I have and give me other  better children    more polite  funnier  nicer  smarter    I would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle. And ultimately I feel that in the same way that we test flame retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove  so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting  which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think  where did you come from  It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed    there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia  there are only so many families of children who are transgender  there are only so many families of prodigies    who also face similar challenges in many ways    there are only so many families in each of those categories    but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating difference within your family is what people are addressing  then you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon. Ironically  it turns out  that it's our differences  and our negotiation of difference  that unite us. I decided to have children while I was working on this project. And many people were astonished and said   But how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong   And I said   I'm not studying everything that can go wrong. What I'm studying is how much love there can be  even when everything appears to be going wrong.  I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen  a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect. And when his ashes were interred  his mother said   I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed  once of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved.  And I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so. So my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis. I had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children. And so she and I have a daughter  and mother and daughter live in Texas. And my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time of whom I am the biological father  and our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura  the lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis. So the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states. And there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family. And there are people who think that families like mine shouldn't be allowed to exist. And I don't accept subtractive models of love  only additive ones. And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on  so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness. The day after our son was born  the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned. He wasn't extending his legs appropriately. She said that might mean that he had brain damage. In so far as he was extending them  he was doing so asymmetrically  which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action. And he had a very large head  which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus. And as she told me all of these things  I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor. And I thought  here I had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of parenting children who are disabled  and I didn't want to join their number. Because what I was encountering was an idea of illness. And like all parents since the dawn of time  I wanted to protect my child from illness. And I wanted also to protect myself from illness. And yet  I knew from the work I had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for  that those would ultimately be his identity  and if they were his identity they would become my identity  that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded. We took him to the MRI machine  we took him to the CAT scanner  we took this day old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw. We felt helpless. And at the end of five hours  they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly. And when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on  she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp. But I thought how my mother was right. I thought  the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world  and until you have children  you don't know what it feels like. I think children had ensnared me the moment I connected fatherhood with loss. But I'm not sure I would have noticed that if I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine. I'd encountered so much strange love  and I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns. And I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities. During these    years  I had witnessed and learned the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility  and I had come to see how it conquers everything else. And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools  enslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children and trying to breed identity out of misery  I realized that day that my research had built me a plank and that I was ready to join them on their ship. Thank you. How many of you have checked your email today  Come on  raise your hands. How many of you are checking it right now  And how about finances  Anybody check that today  Credit card  investment account  How about this week  Now  how about your household energy use  Anybody check that today  This week  Last week  A few energy geeks spread out across the room. It's good to see you guys. But the rest of us    this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet  and even we aren't paying attention to the energy use that's driving climate change. The woman in the photo with me is Harriet. We met her on our first family vacation. Harriet's paying attention to her energy use  and she is decidedly not an energy geek. This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention. This is coal  the most common source of electricity on the planet  and there's enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year. But unfortunately  between here and here  most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat. In fact  only    percent ends up as light. So this coal will last a little bit more than a month. If you wanted to light this bulb for a year  you'd need this much coal. The bad news here is that  for every unit of energy we use  we waste nine. That means there's good news  because for every unit of energy we save  we save the other nine. So the question is  how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we're using  and start wasting less of it  The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment that was run one hot summer     years ago  and only    miles from here  in San Marcos  California. Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood  asking people to turn off their air conditioning and turn on their fans. One quarter of the homes received a message that said  did you know you could save    dollars a month this summer  Turn off your air conditioning  turn on your fans. Another group got an environmental message. And still a third group got a message about being good citizens  preventing blackouts. Most people guessed that money saving message would work best of all. In fact  none of these messages worked. They had zero impact on energy consumption. It was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all. But there was a fourth message  and this message simply said   When surveyed     percent of your neighbors said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans. Please join them. Turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans.  And wouldn't you know it  they did. The people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing. So what does this tell us  Well  if something is inconvenient  even if we believe in it  moral suasion  financial incentives  don't do much to move us    but social pressure  that's powerful stuff. And harnessed correctly  it can be a powerful force for good. In fact  it already is. Inspired by this insight  my friend Dan Yates and I started a company called Opower. We built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy. We deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar sized homes. Just like those effective door hangers  we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors  and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save. We started with paper  we moved to a mobile application  web  and now even a controllable thermostat  and for the last five years we've been running the largest behavioral science experiment in the world. And it's working. Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than     million dollars on their energy bills  and we're just getting started. This year alone  in partnership with more than    utilities in six countries  we're going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings. Now  the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours  but for the rest of us  two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined for more than a year. Two terawatt hours  it's roughly half what the U.S. solar industry produced last year. And two terawatt hours  In terms of coal  we'd need to burn    of these wheelbarrows every minute around the clock every day for an entire year to get two terawatt hours of electricity. And we're not burning anything. We're just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior. But we're just one company  and this is just scratching the surface. Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted  and when I say wasted  I don't mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs. They may. I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms  and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home. That's    billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well being but does contribute to climate change. That's    billion    with a B    every year in the U.S. alone. That's half our coal usage right there. Now thankfully  some of the world's best material scientists are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources like these  and this is both fantastic and essential. But the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future  it isn't on this slide. It's in this room. It's you  and it's me. And we can harness this resource with no new material science simply by applying behavioral science. We can do it today  we know it works  and it will save us money right away. So what are we waiting for  Well  in most places  utility regulation hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison. Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy. They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it. But this story is much more than about household energy use. Take a look at the Prius. It's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science. The dashboard that shows drivers how much energy they're saving in real time makes former speed demons drive more like cautious grandmothers. Which brings us back to Harriet. We met her on our first family vacation. She came over to meet my young daughter  and she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name is also Harriet. She asked me what I did for a living  and I told her  I work with utilities to help people save energy. It was then that her eyes lit up. She looked at me  and she said   You're exactly the person I need to talk to. You see  two weeks ago  my husband and I got a letter in the mail from our utility. It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors.   And for the last two weeks  all we can think about  talk about  and even argue about  is what we should be doing to save energy. We did everything that letter told us to do  and still I know there must be more. Now I'm here with a genuine expert. Tell me. What should I do to save energy   There are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question. My goal is to make sure we are all asking it. Thank you. I am sorry I cannot show you my face  because if I do  the bad guys will come for me. My journey started    years ago. I was a young reporter. I had just come out of college. Then I got a scoop. The scoop was quite a very simple story. Police officers were taking bribes from hawkers who were hawking on the streets. As a young reporter  I thought that I should do it in a different way  so that it has a maximum impact  since everybody knew that it was happening  and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system. So I decided to go there and act as a seller. As part of selling  I was able to document the hard core evidence. The impact was great. It was fantastic. This was what many call immersion journalism  or undercover journalism. I am an undercover journalist. My journalism is hinged on three basic principles  naming  shaming and jailing. Journalism is about results. It's about affecting your community or your society in the most progressive way. I have worked on this for over    years  and I can tell you  the results are very good. One story that comes to mind in my undercover pieces is  Spirit Child.  It was about children who were born with deformities  and their parents felt that once they were born with those deformities  they were not good enough to live in the society  so they were given some concoction to take and as a result they died. So I built a prosthetic baby  and I went into the village  pretended as though this baby had been born with a deformity  and here was the guys who do the killing. They got themselves ready. In their bids to kill  I got the police on standby  and they came that fateful morning to come and kill the child. I recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction. They put it on fire. It was boiling hot  getting ready to give to the kids. Whilst this was going on  the police I had alerted  they were on standby  and just as the concoction was ready  and they were about to give it to the kids  I phoned the police  and fortunately they came and busted them. As I speak now  they are before the courts. Don't forget the key principles  naming  shaming and jailing. The court process is taking place  and I'm very sure at the end of the day we will find them  and we will put them where they belong too. Another key story that comes to mind  which relates to this spirit child phenomenon  is  The Spell of the Albinos.  I'm sure most of you may have heard  in Tanzania  children who are born with albinism are sometimes considered as being unfit to live in society. Their bodies are chopped up with machetes and are supposed to be used for some concoctions or some potions for people to get money    or so many  many stories people would tell about it. It was time to go undercover again. So I went undercover as a man who was interested in this particular business  of course. Again  a prosthetic arm was built. For the first time  I filmed on hidden camera the guys who do this  and they were ready to buy the arm and they were ready to use it to prepare those potions for people. I am glad today the Tanzanian government has taken action  but the key issue is that the Tanzanian government could only take action because the evidence was available. My journalism is about hard core evidence. If I say you have stolen  I show you the evidence that you have stolen. I show you how you stole it and when  or what you used what you had stolen to do. What is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society  My kind of journalism is a product of my society. I know that sometimes people have their own criticisms about undercover journalism. and put it on the table  so that we should not be afraid. He wants to bring the cocoa and send it to Cote d'Ivoire. So with my hidden intention  I kept quiet. I didn't utter a word. But my colleagues didn't know. So after collecting the money  when he left  we were waiting for him to bring the goods. Immediately after he left  I told my colleagues that since I was the leader of the group  I told my colleagues that if they come  we will arrest them. Second official  I don't even know the place called  unclear . I've never stepped there before. So I'm surprised. You see a hand counting money just in front of me. The next moment  you see the money in my hands  counting  whereas I have not come into contact with anybody. I have not done any business with anybody. Reporter  When Metro News contacted investigative reporter Anas Aremeyaw Anas for his reaction  he just smiled and gave this video extract he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen. The officer who earlier denied involvement pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled. Anas Aremeyaw Anas  This was another story on anticorruption. And here was him  denying. But you see  when you have the hard core evidence  you are able to affect society. Sometimes these are some of the headlines that come.  Music   I will curse Anas to death   Anas Lies   Alarm Blows Over Anas' News for Cash Video   Agenda Against Top CEPS Officials Exposed   Anas Operates with Invisible Powers    Gov't Wobbles Over Anas Video   Hunting the Hunter   Anas 'Bribe' Men in Court      Heads Roll Over Anas Tape   Finance Minister Backs Anas      Given Queries Over Anas' Story   GJA Stands By Anas   Prez. Mills Storms Tema Harbour Over Anas Video    Late Prof. John Evans Atta Mills  Former president of Ghana   John Evans Atta Mills  What Anas says is not something which is unknown to many of us  but please  those of you who are agents  and who are leading the customs officers into temptation  I'm telling you  Ghana is not going to say any good things to you about this. AAA  That was my president. I thought that I couldn't come here without giving you something special. I have a piece  and I'm excited that I'm sharing it for the first time with you here. I have been undercover in the prisons. I have been there for a long time. And I can tell you  what I saw is not nice. But again  I can only affect society and affect government if I bring out the hard core evidence. Many times  the prison authorities have denied ever having issues of drug abuse  issues of sodomy  so many issues they would deny that it ever happens. How can you obtain the hard core evidence  So I was in the prison.   Nsawan Prison   Now  what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies. Now  I happen to have followed one of my inmates  one of my friends  from his sick bed till death  and I can tell you it was not a nice thing at all. There were issues of bad food being served as I recall that some of the food I ate is just not good for a human being. Toilet facilities  very bad. I mean  you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend    and that's what I call proper  when four of us are on a manhole. It is something that if you narrate it to somebody  the person wouldn't believe it. The only way that you can let the person believe is when you show hard core evidence. Of course  drugs were abundant. It was easier to get cannabis  heroin and cocaine  faster even  in the prison than outside the prison. Evil in the society is an extreme disease. If you have extreme diseases  you need to get extreme remedies. My kind of journalism might not fit in other continents or other countries  but I can tell you  it works in my part of the continent of Africa  because usually  when people talk about corruption  they ask   Where is the evidence  Show me the evidence.  I say   This is the evidence.  And that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars. You see  we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions. That is why I was particularly excited when we launched our  Africa Investigates  series where we investigated a lot of African countries. As a result of the success of the  Africa Investigates  series  we are moving on to World Investigates. By the end of it  a lot more bad guys on our continent will be put behind bars. This will not stop. I'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism  because I know that when evil men destroy  good men must build and bind. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you. I have some questions for you. How did you end up in jail  This was just a few weeks ago  I believe  yeah  AAA  Sure. You know  undercover is all about setting the priorities right  so we got people to take me to court. So I went through the very legal process  because at the end of the day  the prison authorities want to check whether indeed you have been there or not  and that's how I got in there. CA  So someone sued you in court  and they took you there  and you were in remand custody for part of it  and you did that deliberately. AAA  Yes  yes. CA  Talk to me just about fear and how you manage that  because you're regularly putting your life at risk. How do you do that  AAA  You see  undercover is always a last resort. Before we go undercover  we follow the rules. And I'm only comfortable and I'm purged of fear whenever I am sure that all the steps have been taken. I don't do it alone. I have a backup team who help ensure that the safety and all the systems are put in place  but you've got to take very intelligent decisions whenever they are happening. If you don't  you will end up losing your life. So yes  when the backup systems are put in place  I'm okay  I go in. Risky  yes  but it's a hazard of a profession. I mean  everybody has their hazard. And once you say that is yours  you've got to take it  as and when it comes. CA  Well  you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work and you've taught us a story like no story I think any of us have heard before. And we're appreciative. We salute you. Thank you so much  Anas. AAA  Thank you. CA  Thank you. Stay safe.  Applause  Well  now we're going to the Bahamas to meet a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with in the wild for the last    years. Now I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains and what they might be doing with all that brainpower in the wild. And we know they use some of that brainpower for just living complicated lives  but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence  Well  we know a few things. We know that their brain to body ratio  which is a physical measure of intelligence  is second only to humans. Cognitively  they can understand artificially created languages. And they pass self awareness tests in mirrors. And in some parts of the world  they use tools  like sponges to hunt fish. But there's one big question left  do they have a language  and if so  what are they talking about  So decades ago  not years ago  I set out to find a place in the world where I could observe dolphins underwater to try to crack the code of their communication system. Now in most parts of the world  the water's pretty murky  so it's very hard to observe animals underwater  but I found a community of dolphins that live in these beautiful  clear  shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas which are just east of Florida. And they spend their daytime resting and socializing in the safety of the shallows  but at night  they go off the edge and hunt in deep water. Now  it's not a bad place to be a researcher  either. So we go out for about five months every summer in a    meter catamaran  and we live  sleep and work at sea for weeks at a time. My main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone  which is an underwater microphone  and this is so I can correlate sound and behavior. And most of our work's pretty non invasive. We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water  since we're actually observing them physically in the water. Now  Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species to work with for a couple of reasons. They're born without spots  and they get spots with age  and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases  so that's fun to track their behavior. And by about the age of     they're fully spotted black and white. Now the mother you see here is Mugsy. She's    years old in this shot  but dolphins can actually live into their early   s. And like all the dolphins in our community  we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots and nicks in her dorsal fin  and also the unique spot patterns as she matured over time. Now  young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up  and they use their teenage years to practice social skills  and at about the age of nine  the females become sexually mature  so they can get pregnant  and the males mature quite a bit later  at around    years of age. And dolphins are very promiscuous  and so we have to determine who the fathers are  so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material out of the water and extracting DNA. So what that means is  after    years  we are tracking three generations  including grandmothers and grandfathers. Now  dolphins are natural acousticians. They make sounds    times as high and hear sounds    times as high as we do. But they have other communication signals they use. They have good vision  so they use body postures to communicate. They have taste  not smell. And they have touch. And sound can actually be felt in the water  because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same. So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance. Now  we do know some things about how sounds are used with certain behaviors. Now  the signature whistle is a whistle that's specific to an individual dolphin  and it's like a name.  Dolphin whistling noises  And this is the best studied sound  because it's easy to measure  really  and you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves are reuniting  for example. Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks. This is the dolphin's sonar.  Dolphin echolocation noises  And they use these clicks to hunt and feed. But they can also tightly pack these clicks together into buzzes and use them socially. For example  males will stimulate a female during a courtship chase. You know  I've been buzzed in the water. Don't tell anyone. It's a secret. And you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that. So dolphins are also political animals  so they have to resolve conflicts. And they use these burst pulsed sounds as well as their head to head behaviors when they're fighting. And these are very unstudied sounds because they're hard to measure. Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight. So you're going to see two groups  and you're going to see the head to head posturing  some open mouths  lots of squawking. There's a bubble. And basically  one of these groups will kind of back off and everything will resolve fine  and it doesn't really escalate into violence too much. Now  in the Bahamas  we also have resident bottlenose that interact socially with the spotted dolphins. For example  they babysit each other's calves. The males have dominance displays that they use when they're chasing each other's females. And the two species actually form temporary alliances when they're chasing sharks away. And one of the mechanisms they use to communicate their coordination is synchrony. They synchronize their sounds and their body postures to look bigger and sound stronger. Now  these are bottlenose dolphins  and you'll see them starting to synchronize their behavior and their sounds. You see  they're synchronizing with their partner as well as the other dyad. I wish I was that coordinated. Now  it's important to remember that you're only hearing the human audible parts of dolphin sounds  and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds  and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds. Now  researchers have actually measured whistle complexity using information theory  and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages. But burst pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery. Now  these are three spectragrams. Two are human words  and one is a dolphin vocalizing. So just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin. Now  it turns out burst pulsed sounds actually look a bit like human phonemes. Now  one way to crack the code is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean  but it's a difficult job  and we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet. But a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology  an interface to do two way communication  and that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas and in real time. Now  scientists have used keyboard interfaces to try to bridge the gap with species including chimpanzees and dolphins. This underwater keyboard in Orlando  Florida  at the Epcot Center  was actually the most sophisticated ever two way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information. So we wanted to develop an interface like this in the Bahamas  but in a more natural setting. And one of the reasons we thought we could do this is because the dolphins were starting to show us a lot of mutual curiosity. They were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations and our postures  and they were also inviting us into dolphin games. Now  dolphins are social mammals  so they love to play  and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed  or sargassum in this case  around. And they're very adept. They like to drag it and drop it from appendage to appendage. Now in this footage  the adult is Caroh. She's    years old here  and this is her newborn  Cobalt  and he's just learning how to play this game. She's kind of teasing him and taunting him. He really wants that sargassum. Now  when dolphins solicit humans for this game  they'll often sink vertically in the water  and they'll have a little sargassum on their flipper  and they'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes on the bottom and let us go get it  and then we'll have a little seaweed keep away game. But when we don't dive down and get it  they'll bring it to the surface and they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail and drop it for us like they do their calves  and then we'll pick it up and have a game. And so we started thinking  well  wouldn't it be neat to build some technology that would allow the dolphins to request these things in real time  their favorite toys  So the original vision was to have a keyboard hanging from the boat attached to a computer  and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys on the keypad and happily exchange information and request toys from each other. But we quickly found out that dolphins simply were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard. They've got better things to do in the wild. They might do it in captivity  but in the wild    So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water  and we labeled four objects they like to play with  the scarf  rope  sargassum  and also had a bow ride  which is a fun activity for a dolphin.  Whistle  And that's the scarf whistle  which is also associated with a visual symbol. And these are artificially created whistles. They're outside the dolphin's normal repertoire  but they're easily mimicked by the dolphins. And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour  working out in the field with this keyboard using it with each other to do requests for toys while the dolphins were watching. And the dolphins could get in on the game. They could point at the visual object  or they could mimic the whistle. Now this is video of a session. The diver here has a rope toy  and I'm on the keyboard on the left  and I've just played the rope key  and that's the request for the toy from the human. So I've got the rope  I'm diving down  and I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention  because they're kind of like little kids. You have to keep their attention. I'm going to drop the rope  see if they come over. Here they come  and then they're going to pick up the rope and drag it around as a toy. Now  I'm at the keyboard on the left  and this is actually the first time that we tried this. I'm going to try to request this toy  the rope toy  from the dolphins using the rope sound. Let's see if they might actually understand what that means. That's the rope whistle. Up come the dolphins  and drop off the rope  yay. Wow. So this is only once. We don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles. Okay  so here's a second toy in the water. This is a scarf toy  and I'm trying to lead the dolphin over to the keyboard to show her the visual and the acoustic signal. Now this dolphin  we call her  the scarf thief   because over the years she's absconded with about    scarves. In fact  we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas. So I'm reaching over. She's got the scarf on her right side. And we try to not touch the animals too much  we really don't want to over habituate them. And I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard. And the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound to request the scarf. So I try to give her the scarf. Whoop. Almost lost it. But this is the moment where everything becomes possible. The dolphin's at the keyboard. You've got full attention. And this sometimes went on for hours. And I wanted to share this video with you not to show you any big breakthroughs  because they haven't happened yet  but to show you the level of intention and focus that these dolphins have  and interest in the system. And because of this  we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology. So we joined forces with Georgia Tech  with Thad Starner's wearable computing group  to build us an underwater wearable computer that we're calling CHAT.  CHAT  Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry  Now  instead of pushing a keyboard through the water  the diver's wearing the complete system  and it's acoustic only  so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad on the forearm  the sounds go out through an underwater speaker  if a dolphin mimics the whistle or a human plays the whistle  the sounds come in and are localized by two hydrophones. The computer can localize who requested the toy if there's a word match. And the real power of the system is in the real time sound recognition  so we can respond to the dolphins quickly and accurately. And we're at prototype stage  but this is how we hope it will play out. So Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle  the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water  but also as a word through bone conduction. So Diver A plays the scarf whistle or Diver B plays the sargassum whistle to request a toy from whoever has it. What we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle  and if Diver A has the sargassum  if that's the sound that was played and requested  then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin and they'll swim away happily into the sunset playing sargassum for forever. Now  how far can this kind of communication go  Well  CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins to request things from us. It's designed to really be two way. Now  will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally  We hope so and we think so. But as we decode their natural sounds  we're also planning to put those back into the computerized system. For example  right now we can put their own signature whistles in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin. Likewise  we can create our own whistles  our own whistle names  and let the dolphins request specific divers to interact with. Now it may be that all our mobile technology will actually be the same technology that helps us communicate with another species down the road. In the case of a dolphin  you know  it's a species that  well  they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways and we might not be able to admit that right now  but they live in quite a different environment  and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems. I mean  imagine what it would be like to really understand the mind of another intelligent species on the planet. Thank you. I made a film that was impossible to make  but I didn't know it was impossible  and that's how I was able to do it.  Mars et Avril  is a science fiction film. It's set in Montreal some    years in the future. No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before because it's expensive  it's set in the future  and it's got tons of visual effects  and it's shot on green screen. Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make ever since I was a kid  really  back when I was reading some comic books and dreaming about what the future might be. When American producers see my film  they think that I had a big budget to do it  like    million. But in fact I had    percent of that budget. I did  Mars et Avril  for only  .  million. So you might wonder  what's the deal here  How did I do this  Well  it's two things. First  it's time. When you don't have money  you must take time  and it took me seven years to do  Mars et Avril.  The second aspect is love. I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved. And it seems like every department had nothing  so they had to rely on our creativity and turn every problem into an opportunity. And that brings me to the point of my talk  actually  how constraints  big creative constraints  can boost creativity. But let me go back in time a bit. In my early   s  I did some graphic novels  but they weren't your usual graphic novels. They were books telling a science fiction story through images and text  and most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation  they were already involved in these books portraying characters into a sort of experimental  theatrical  simplistic way. And one of these actors is the great stage director and actor Robert Lepage. And I just love this guy. I've been in love with this guy since I was a kid. His career I admire a lot. And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project  and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of Eug ne Spaak  who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation in between time  space  love  music and women. And he was a perfect fit for the part  and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance. He was the one who believed in me and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books into a film  and to write  direct  and produce the film myself. And Robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity. Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet. I mean  his agenda is booked until       and he's really hard to get  and I wanted him to be in the movie  to reprise his role in the movie. But the thing is  had I waited for him until       my film wouldn't be a futuristic film anymore  so I just couldn't do that. Right  But that's kind of a big problem. How do you get somebody who is too busy to star in a movie  Well  I said as a joke in a production meeting    and this is a true story  by the way   I said   Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram  Because  you know  he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time  and he's an illuminated being in my mind  and he's in between reality and virtual reality  so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram.  Everybody around the table laughed  but the joke was kind of a good solution  so that's what we ended up doing. Here's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras. He was dressed in green and he was like in a green aquarium. Each camera was covering    degrees of his head  so that in post production we could use pretty much any angle we needed  and we shot only his head. Six months later there was a guy on set  a mime portraying the body  the vehicle for the head. And he was wearing a green hood so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction and replace it with Robert Lepage's head. So he became like a renaissance man  and here's what it looks like in the movie. didn't account for the technical challenges. I welded the breech  but the valve is still gaping. I tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box  but I might have hit a heartstring. It still sounds too low.  Jacques Languirand   That's normal. The instrument always ends up resembling its model.  Martin Villeneuve  Now these musical instruments that you see in this excerpt  they're my second example of how constraints can boost creativity  because I desperately needed these objects in my movie. They are objects of desire. They are imaginary musical instruments. And they carry a nice story with them. Actually  I knew what these things would look like in my mind for many  many years. But my problem was  I didn't have the money to pay for them. I couldn't afford them. So that's kind of a big problem too. How do you get something that you can't afford  And  you know  I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea. I said   What if I have somebody else pay for them   But who on Earth would be interested by seven not yet built musical instruments inspired by women's bodies  And I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal  because who better to understand the kind of crazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen  So I found my way to Guy Lalibert   Cirque du Soleil's CEO  and I presented my crazy idea to him with sketches like this and visual references  and something pretty amazing happened. Guy was interested by this idea not because I was asking for his money  but because I came to him with a good idea in which everybody was happy. It was kind of a perfect triangle in which the art buyer was happy because he got the instruments at a cheaper price  because they weren't even made. He took a leap of faith. And the artist  Dominique Engel  brilliant guy  he was happy too because he had a dream project to work on for a year. And obviously I was happy because I got the instruments in my film for free  which was kind of what I tried to do. So here they are. And my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from the green  because this is a weird color  a crazy color  and you need to replace the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later. And I had  again  pretty much  ideas in my mind as to what the world would be  but then again I turned to my childhood imagination and went to the work of Belgian comic book master Fran ois Schuiten in Belgium. And this guy is another guy I admire a lot  and I wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer. But people told me  you know  Martin  it's impossible  the guy is too busy and he will say no. Well  I said  you know what  instead of mimicking his style  I might as well call the real guy and ask him  and I sent him my books  and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium. In other words  there was space for him to dream with me. So here I was with one of my childhood heroes  drawing every single frame that's in the film to turn that into Montreal in the future. And it was an amazing collaboration to work with this great artist whom I admire. But then  you know  eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality. So  again  my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that I could think of. And there's this guy in Montreal  another Quebecois called Carlos Monzon  and he's a very good VFX artist. This guy had been lead compositor on such films as  Avatar  and  Star Trek  and  Transformers   and other unknown projects like this  and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job  and I had to convince him  and  instead of working on the next Spielberg movie  he accepted to work on mine. Why  Because I offered him a space to dream. So if you don't have money to offer to people  you must strike their imagination with something as nice as you can think of. So this is what happened on this movie  and that's how it got made  and we went to this very nice postproduction company in Montreal called Vision Globale  and they lent their    artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film. So I want to tell you that  if you have some crazy ideas in your mind  and that people tell you that it's impossible to make  well  that's an even better reason to want to do it  because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the final result  whereas if you start to deal with problems as being your allies rather than your opponents  life will start to dance with you in the most amazing way. I have experienced it. And you might end up doing some crazy projects  and who knows  you might even end up going to Mars. Thank you. The writer George Eliot cautioned us that  among all forms of mistake  prophesy is the most gratuitous. The person that we would all acknowledge as her   th century counterpart  Yogi Berra  agreed. He said   It's tough to make predictions  especially about the future.  I'm going to ignore their cautions and make one very specific forecast. In the world that we are creating very quickly  we're going to see more and more things that look like science fiction  and fewer and fewer things that look like jobs. Our cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves  which means we're going to need fewer truck drivers. We're going to hook Siri up to Watson and use that to automate a lot of the work that's currently done by customer service reps and troubleshooters and diagnosers  and we're already taking R D   painting him orange  and putting him to work carrying shelves around warehouses  which means we need a lot fewer people to be walking up and down those aisles. Now  for about     years  people have been saying exactly what I'm telling you    the age of technological unemployment is at hand   starting with the Luddites smashing looms in Britain just about two centuries ago  and they have been wrong. Our economies in the developed world have coasted along on something pretty close to full employment. Which brings up a critical question  Why is this time different  if it really is  The reason it's different is that  just in the past few years  our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never  ever had before  understanding  speaking  hearing  seeing  answering  writing  and they're still acquiring new skills. For example  mobile humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive  but the research arm of the Defense Department just launched a competition to have them do things like this  and if the track record is any guide  this competition is going to be successful. So when I look around  I think the day is not too far off at all when we're going to have androids doing a lot of the work that we are doing right now. And we're creating a world where there is going to be more and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs. It's a world that Erik Brynjolfsson and I are calling  the new machine age.  The thing to keep in mind is that this is absolutely great news. This is the best economic news on the planet these days. Not that there's a lot of competition  right  This is the best economic news we have these days for two main reasons. The first is  technological progress is what allows us to continue this amazing recent run that we're on where output goes up over time  while at the same time  prices go down  and volume and quality just continue to explode. Now  some people look at this and talk about shallow materialism  but that's absolutely the wrong way to look at it. This is abundance  which is exactly what we want our economic system to provide. The second reason that the new machine age is such great news is that  once the androids start doing jobs  we don't have to do them anymore  and we get freed up from drudgery and toil. Now  when I talk about this with my friends in Cambridge and Silicon Valley  they say   Fantastic. No more drudgery  no more toil. This gives us the chance to imagine an entirely different kind of society  a society where the creators and the discoverers and the performers and the innovators come together with their patrons and their financiers to talk about issues  entertain  enlighten  provoke each other.  It's a society really  that looks a lot like the TED Conference. And there's actually a huge amount of truth here. We are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place. In a world where it is just about as easy to generate an object as it is to print a document  we have amazing new possibilities. The people who used to be craftsmen and hobbyists are now makers  and they're responsible for massive amounts of innovation. And artists who were formerly constrained can now do things that were never  ever possible for them before. So this is a time of great flourishing  and the more I look around  the more convinced I become that this quote  from the physicist Freeman Dyson  is not hyperbole at all. This is just a plain statement of the facts. We are in the middle of an astonishing period.   Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations  of arts and of sciences.    Freeman Dyson  Which brings up another great question  What could possibly go wrong in this new machine age  Right  Great  hang up  flourish  go home. We're going to face two really thorny sets of challenges as we head deeper into the future that we're creating. The first are economic  and they're really nicely summarized in an apocryphal story about a back and forth between Henry Ford II and Walter Reuther  who was the head of the auto workers union. They were touring one of the new modern factories  and Ford playfully turns to Reuther and says   Hey Walter  how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues   And Reuther shoots back   Hey Henry  how are you going to get them to buy cars   Reuther's problem in that anecdote is that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy that's full of machines  and we see this very clearly in the statistics. If you look over the past couple decades at the returns to capital    in other words  corporate profits    we see them going up  and we see that they're now at an all time high. If we look at the returns to labor  in other words total wages paid out in the economy  we see them at an all time low and heading very quickly in the opposite direction. So this is clearly bad news for Reuther. It looks like it might be great news for Ford  but it's actually not. If you want to sell huge volumes of somewhat expensive goods to people  you really want a large  stable  prosperous middle class. We have had one of those in America for just about the entire postwar period. But the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now. We all know a lot of the statistics  but just to repeat one of them  median income in America has actually gone down over the past    years  and we're in danger of getting trapped in some vicious cycle where inequality and polarization continue to go up over time. The societal challenges that come along with that kind of inequality deserve some attention. There are a set of societal challenges that I'm actually not that worried about  and they're captured by images like this. This is not the kind of societal problem that I am concerned about. There is no shortage of dystopian visions about what happens when our machines become self aware  and they decide to rise up and coordinate attacks against us. I'm going to start worrying about those the day my computer becomes aware of my printer. So this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about. To tell you the kinds of societal challenges that are going to come up in the new machine age  I want to tell a story about two stereotypical American workers. And to make them really stereotypical  let's make them both white guys. And the first one is a college educated professional  creative type  manager  engineer  doctor  lawyer  that kind of worker. We're going to call him  Ted.  He's at the top of the American middle class. His counterpart is not college educated and works as a laborer  works as a clerk  does low level white collar or blue collar work in the economy. We're going to call that guy  Bill.  And if you go back about    years  Bill and Ted were leading remarkably similar lives. For example  in      they were both very likely to have full time jobs  working at least    hours a week. But as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented  as we started to automate the economy  and      is just about when computers started to be used by businesses  as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy  the fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot. Over this time frame  Ted has continued to hold a full time job. Bill hasn't. In many cases  Bill has left the economy entirely  and Ted very rarely has. Over time  Ted's marriage has stayed quite happy. Bill's hasn't. And Ted's kids have grown up in a two parent home  while Bill's absolutely have not over time. Other ways that Bill is dropping out of society  He's decreased his voting in presidential elections  and he's started to go to prison a lot more often. So I cannot tell a happy story about these social trends  and they don't show any signs of reversing themselves. They're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic group we look at  and they're actually getting so severe that they're in danger of overwhelming even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement. And what my friends in Silicon Valley and Cambridge are overlooking is that they're Ted. They're living these amazingly busy  productive lives  and they've got all the benefits to show from that  while Bill is leading a very different life. They're actually both proof of how right Voltaire was when he talked about the benefits of work  and the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils.   Work saves a man from three great evils  boredom  vice and need.    Voltaire  So with these challenges  what do we do about them  The economic playbook is surprisingly clear  surprisingly straightforward  in the short term especially. The robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two  so the classic Econ     playbook is going to work just fine  Encourage entrepreneurship  double down on infrastructure  and make sure we're turning out people from our educational system with the appropriate skills. But over the longer term  if we are moving into an economy that's heavy on technology and light on labor  and we are  then we have to consider some more radical interventions  for example  something like a guaranteed minimum income. Now  that's probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable  because that idea is associated with the extreme left wing and with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth. I did a little bit of research on this notion  and it might calm some folk down to know that the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income has been championed by those frothing at the mouth socialists Friedrich Hayek  Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman. And if you find yourself worried that something like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of complacent  you might be interested to know that social mobility  one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the United States  is now lower than it is in the northern European countries that have these very generous social safety nets. So the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward. The societal one is a lot more challenging. I don't know what the playbook is for getting Bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life. I do know that education is a huge part of it. I witnessed this firsthand. I was a Montessori kid for the first few years of my education  and what that education taught me is that the world is an interesting place and my job is to go explore it. The school stopped in third grade  so then I entered the public school system  and it felt like I had been sent to the Gulag. With the benefit of hindsight  I now know the job was to prepare me for life as a clerk or a laborer  but at the time it felt like the job was to kind of bore me into some submission with what was going on around me. We have to do better than this. We cannot keep turning out Bills. So we see some green shoots that things are getting better. We see technology deeply impacting education and engaging people  from our youngest learners up to our oldest ones. We see very prominent business voices telling us we need to rethink some of the things that we've been holding dear for a while. And we see very serious and sustained and data driven efforts to understand how to intervene in some of the most troubled communities that we have. So the green shoots are out there. I don't want to pretend for a minute that what we have is going to be enough. We're facing very tough challenges. To give just one example  there are about five million Americans who have been unemployed for at least six months. We're not going to fix things for them by sending them back to Montessori. And my biggest worry is that we're creating a world where we're going to have glittering technologies embedded in kind of a shabby society and supported by an economy that generates inequality instead of opportunity. But I actually don't think that's what we're going to do. I think we're going to do something a lot better for one very straightforward reason  The facts are getting out there. The realities of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known. If we wanted to accelerate that process  we could do things like have our best economists and policymakers play  Jeopardy   against Watson. We could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip. And if we do enough of these kinds of things  the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different. And then we're off to the races  because I don't believe for a second that we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges or that we have become too apathetic or hard hearted to even try. I started my talk with quotes from wordsmiths who were separated by an ocean and a century. Let me end it with words from politicians who were similarly distant. Winston Churchill came to my home of MIT in       and he said   If we are to bring the broad masses of the people in every land to the table of abundance  it can only be by the tireless improvement of all of our means of technical production.  Abraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient. He said   I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth  they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to give them the plain facts.  So the optimistic note  great point that I want to leave you with is that the plain facts of the machine age are becoming clear  and I have every confidence that we're going to use them to chart a good course into the challenging  abundant economy that we're creating. Thank you very much. So what does it mean for a machine to be athletic  We will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism and the research to achieve it with the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters  or quads  for short. Quads have been around for a long time. They're so popular these days because they're mechanically simple. By controlling the speeds of these four propellers  these machines can roll  pitch  yaw  and accelerate along their common orientation. On board are also a battery  a computer  various sensors and wireless radios. Quads are extremely agile  but this agility comes at a cost. They are inherently unstable  and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly. So  how did it just do that  Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop serve as an indoor global positioning system. It's used to locate objects in the space that have these reflective markers on them. This data is then sent to another laptop that is running estimation and control algorithms  which in turn sends commands to the quad  which is also running estimation and control algorithms. The bulk of our research is algorithms. It's the magic that brings these machines to life. So how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete  We use something broadly called model based design. We first capture the physics with a mathematical model of how the machines behave. We then use a branch of mathematics called control theory to analyze these models and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them. For example  that's how we can make the quad hover. We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations. We then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad. Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach. Suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole. With a little bit of practice  it's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this  although we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground and the use of our very versatile hands. It becomes a little bit more difficult when I only have one foot on the ground and when I don't use my hands. Notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top  which means that it can be located in the space. You can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced. How did we design the algorithms to do this  We added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad. Once we have a model of the combined quad pole system  we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it. Here  you see that it's stable  and even if I give it little nudges  it goes back    to the nice  balanced position. We can also augment the model to include where we want the quad to be in space. Using this pointer  made out of reflective markers  I can point to where I want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me. The key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms  designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory. Let's tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop  and I will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world. Notice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it. Unlike the balancing pole  I did not include the mathematical model of the glass in the system. In fact  the system doesn't even know that the glass is there. Like before  I could use the pointer to tell the quad where I want it to be in space. Okay  you should be asking yourself  why doesn't the water fall out of the glass  Two facts. The first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way. The second is that the propellers are all pointing in the same direction of the glass  pointing up. You put these two things together  the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects  which at these speeds are negligible. And that's why you don't need to model the glass. It naturally doesn't spill  no matter what the quad does. The lesson here is that some high performance tasks are easier than others  and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard. In this instance  carrying a glass of water is easy. Balancing a pole is hard. We've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured. Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage  Conventional wisdom says that you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly  because there are four degrees of freedom to control  roll  pitch  yaw and acceleration. Hexacopters and octocopters  with six and eight propellers  can provide redundancy  but quadrocopters are much more popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs  four. Or do they  If we analyze the mathematical model of this machine with only two working propellers  we discover that there's an unconventional way to fly it. We relinquish control of yaw  but roll  pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration. Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible. In this instance  this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage  just like human athletes do  instead of building machines with redundancy. We can't help but hold our breath when we watch a diver somersaulting into the water  or when a vaulter is twisting in the air  the ground fast approaching. Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry  Will the vaulter stick the landing  Suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started. This maneuver is going to happen so quickly that we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution. There simply isn't enough time. Instead  what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly  observe how it finishes the maneuver  and then use that information to modify its behavior so that the next flip is better. Similar to the diver and the vaulter  it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard. Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports. How do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort  This quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple  so not too large. The following calculations are made every    milliseconds  or    times per second. We first figure out where the ball is going. We then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from. Third  a trajectory is planned that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball. Fourth  we only execute    milliseconds' worth of that strategy. Twenty milliseconds later  the whole process is repeated until the quad strikes the ball. Machines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own  they can do it collectively. These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net. They perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me. Notice that  at full extension  these quads are vertical. In fact  when fully extended  this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels at the end of their launch. The algorithms to do this are very similar to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me. Mathematical models are used to continuously re plan a cooperative strategy    times per second. Everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities. What happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being  What I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming. It can recognize what my various body parts are doing in real time. Similar to the pointer that I used earlier  we can use this as inputs to the system. We now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures. Interaction doesn't have to be virtual. It can be physical. Take this quad  for example. It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space. If I try to move it out of the way  it fights me  and moves back to where it wants to be. We can change this behavior  however. We can use mathematical models to estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad. Once we know this force  we can also change the laws of physics  as far as the quad is concerned  of course. Here  the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid. We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine. I will use this new capability to position this camera carrying quad to the appropriate location for filming the remainder of this demonstration. So we can physically interact with these quads and we can change the laws of physics. Let's have a little bit of fun with this. For what you will see next  these quads will initially behave as if they were on Pluto. As time goes on  gravity will be increased until we're all back on planet Earth  but I assure you we won't get there. Okay  here goes. Whew  You're all thinking now  these guys are having way too much fun  and you're probably also asking yourself  why exactly are they building machine athletes  Some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom is to hone skills and develop capabilities. Others think that it has more of a social role  that it's used to bind the group. Similarly  we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits. What impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life  Like all our past creations and innovations  they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused. This is not a technical choice we are faced with  it's a social one. Let's make the right choice  the choice that brings out the best in the future of machines  just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us. Let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain. They're the current members of the Flying Machine Arena research team. Federico Augugliaro  Dario Brescianini  Markus Hehn  Sergei Lupashin  Mark Muller and Robin Ritz. Look out for them. They're destined for great things. Thank you. This will not be a speech like any one I have ever given. I will talk to you today about the failure of leadership in global politics and in our globalizing economy. And I won't provide some feel good  ready made solutions. But I will in the end urge you to rethink  actually take risks  and get involved in what I see as a global evolution of democracy. Failure of leadership. What is the failure of leadership today  And why is our democracy not working  Well  I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken you out of the process. So let me  from my personal experiences  give you an insight  so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going down a blind alley. Let's start from the beginning. Let's start from democracy. Well  if you go back to the Ancient Greeks  it was a revelation  a discovery  that we had the potential  together  to be masters of our own fate  to be able to examine  to learn  to imagine  and then to design a better life. And democracy was the political innovation which protected this freedom  because we were liberated from fear so that our minds in fact  whether they be despots or dogmas  could be the protagonists. Democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power  whether it was of tyrants or of high priests  their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth. Well  I first began to understand this when I was    years old. I used to  to try to avoid homework  sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly. You see  then Greece was under control of a very powerful establishment which was strangling the country  and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine Greece  to imagine a Greece where freedom reigned and where  maybe  the people  the citizens  could actually rule their own country. I used to join him in many of the campaigns  and you can see me here next to him. I'm the younger one there  to the side. You may not recognize me because I used to part my hair differently there. So in       elections were coming  things were going well in the campaign  the house was electric. We really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in Greece. Then one night  military trucks drive up to our house. Soldiers storm the door. They find me up on the top terrace. A sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun  puts it to my head  and says   Tell me where your father is or I will kill you.  My father  hiding nearby  reveals himself  and was summarily taken to prison. Well  we survived  but democracy did not. Seven brutal years of dictatorship which we spent in exile. Now  today  our democracies are again facing a moment of truth. Let me tell you a story. Sunday evening  Brussels  April     . I'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union. I had just been elected prime minister  but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth that our deficit was not   percent  as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections by the previous government  but actually   .  percent. But the deficit was only the symptom of much deeper problems that Greece was facing  and I had been elected on a mandate  a mission  actually  to tackle these problems  whether it was lack of transparency and accountability in governance  or whether it was a clientelistic state offering favors to the powerful    tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system  politics and media captured by special interests. But despite our electoral mandate  the markets mistrusted us. Our borrowing costs were skyrocketing  and we were facing possible default. So I went to Brussels on a mission to make the case for a united European response  one that would calm the markets and give us the time to make the necessary reforms. But time we didn't get. Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels. Negotiations are difficult  the tensions are high  progress is slow  and then     minutes to    a prime minister shouts out   We have to finish in    minutes.  I said   Why  These are important decisions. Let's deliberate a little bit longer.  Another prime minister comes in and says   No  we have to have an agreement now  because in    minutes  the markets are opening up in Japan  and there will be havoc in the global economy.  We quickly came to a decision in those    minutes. This time it was not the military  but the markets  that put a gun to our collective heads. What followed were the most difficult decisions in my life  painful to me  painful to my countrymen  imposing cuts  austerity  often on those not to blame for the crisis. With these sacrifices  Greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided a collapse. Greece  yes  triggered the Euro crisis  and some people blame me for pulling the trigger. But I think today that most would agree that Greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone  vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system  vulnerabilities of our democracies. Our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail  or  more accurately  too big to control. Our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws  evade taxes  evade environmental or labor standards. Our democracies are undermined by the growing inequality and the growing concentration of power and wealth  lobbies  corruption  the speed of the markets or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster  have constrained our democracies  and they have constrained our capacity to imagine and actually use the potential  your potential  in finding solutions. Greece  you see  was only a preview of what is in store for us all. I  overly optimistically  had hoped that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece  for Europe  for the world  to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions. Instead  I had a very humbling experience. In Brussels  when we tried desperately again and again to find common solutions  I realized that not one  not one of us  had ever dealt with a similar crisis. But worse  we were trapped by our collective ignorance. We were led by our fears. And our fears led to a blind faith in the orthodoxy of austerity. Instead of reaching out to the common or the collective wisdom in our societies  investing in it to find more creative solutions  we reverted to political posturing. And then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis  and of course that made it very easy to look for a whipping boy for our collective European failure  and of course that was Greece. Those profligate  idle  ouzo swilling  Zorba dancing Greeks  they are the problem. Punish them  Well  a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself. But let me warn you  this is not just about Greece. This could be the pattern that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex  cross border problems  whether it's climate change  whether it's migration  whether it's the financial system. That is  abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential  falling victims to our fears  our stereotypes  our dogmas  taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around our citizens. And doing so will only test the faith of our citizens  of our peoples  even more in the democratic process. It's no wonder that many political leaders  and I don't exclude myself  have lost the trust of our people. When riot police have to protect parliaments  a scene which is increasingly common around the world  then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies. That's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people own and decide on the terms of the rescue package. My European counterparts  some of them  at least  said   You can't do this. There will be havoc in the markets again.  I said   We need to  before we restore confidence in the markets  we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people.  Since leaving office  I have had time to reflect. We have weathered the storm  in Greece and in Europe  but we remain challenged. If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential  well then    percent youth unemployment in Greece  and in other countries  certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion. So far  we've thrown economics at the problem  actually mostly austerity  and certainly we could have designed alternatives  a different strategy  a green stimulus for green jobs  or mutualized debt  Eurobonds which would support countries in need from market pressures  these would have been much more viable alternatives. Yet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one of democracy. So let's try something else. Let's see how we can bring people back to the process. Let's throw democracy at the problem. Again  the Ancient Greeks  with all their shortcomings  believed in the wisdom of the crowd at their best moments. In people we trust. Democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating  debating  taking on public responsibilities for public affairs. Average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to decide on critical matters of the day. Science  theater  research  philosophy  games of the mind and the body  they were daily exercises. Actually they were an education for participation  for the potential  for growing the potential of our citizens. And those who shunned politics  well  they were idiots. You see  in Ancient Greece  in ancient Athens  that term originated there.  Idiot  comes from the root  idio   oneself. A person who is self centered  secluded  excluded  someone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs. And participation took place in the agora  the agora having two meanings  both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation. You see  markets and politics then were one  unified  accessible  transparent  because they gave power to the people. They serve the demos  democracy. Above government  above markets was the direct rule of the people. Today we have globalized the markets but we have not globalized our democratic institutions. So our politicians are limited to local politics  while our citizens  even though they see a great potential  are prey to forces beyond their control. So how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora  How do we democratize globalization  And I'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the United Nations or the G  . I'm talking about  how do we secure the space  the demos  the platform of values  so that we can tap into all of your potential  Well  this is exactly where I think Europe fits in. Europe  despite its recent failures  is the world's most successful cross border peace experiment. So let's see if it can't be an experiment in global democracy  a new kind of democracy. Let's see if we can't design a European agora  not simply for products and services  but for our citizens  where they can work together  deliberate  learn from each other  exchange between art and cultures  where they can come up with creative solutions. Let's imagine that European citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a European president  or citizen juries chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues  a European wide referendum where our citizens  as the lawmakers  vote on future treaties. And here's an idea  Why not have the first truly European citizens by giving our immigrants  not Greek or German or Swedish citizenship  but a European citizenship  And make sure we actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in Europe. Where our common identity is democracy  where our education is through participation  and where participation builds trust and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia. Europe of and by the people  a Europe  an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders. Now  some might accuse me of being naive  putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people. Well  after decades in politics  I am also a pragmatist. Believe me  I have been  I am  part of today's political system  and I know things must change. We must revive politics as the power to imagine  reimagine  and redesign for a better world. But I also know that this disruptive force of change won't be driven by the politics of today. The revival of democratic politics will come from you  and I mean all of you. Everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas  whether it's here in this room or just outside this room or online or locally  where everybody lives  everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality  everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy  dogma rather than critical thinking  technocracy rather than democracy  everyone who stands up to the unchecked power  whether it's authoritarian leaders  plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens  or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few. It is in their interest that all of us are idiots. Let's not be. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  You seem to describe a political leadership that is kind of unprepared and a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets  and that scene in Brussels that you describe  to me  as a citizen  is terrifying. Help us understand how you felt after the decision. It was not a good decision  clearly  but how do you feel after that  not as the prime minister  but as George  George Papandreou  Well  obviously there were constraints which didn't allow me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted  and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem. And that hurt. That hurt because that  first of all  hurt the younger generation  and not only  many of them are demonstrating outside  but I think this is one of our problems. When we face these crises  we have kept the potential  the huge potential of our society out of this process  and we are closing in on ourselves in politics  and I think we need to change that  to really find new participatory ways using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology  the minds that we have  and I think we can find solutions which are much better  but we have to be open. BG  You seem to suggest that the way forward is more Europe  and that is not to be an easy discourse right now in most European countries. It's rather the other way    more closed borders and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out of some of the different parts of the European construction. How do you reconcile that  GP  Well  I think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game. And the fundamental idea of Europe is that we can cooperate beyond borders  go beyond our conflicts and work together. And the paradox is that  because we have this blame game  we have less the potential to convince our citizens that we should work together  while now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together. Now  more Europe for me is not simply giving more power to Brussels. It is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe  that is  really making Europe a project of the people. So that  I think  would be a way to answer some of the fears that we have in our society. BG  George  thank you for coming to TED. GP  Thank you very much.BG  Thank you. Applause  I write fiction sci fi thrillers  so if I say  killer robots   you'd probably think something like this. But I'm actually not here to talk about fiction. I'm here to talk about very real killer robots  autonomous combat drones. Now  I'm not referring to Predator and Reaper drones  which have a human making targeting decisions. I'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons that make lethal decisions about human beings all on their own. There's actually a technical term for this  lethal autonomy. Now  lethally autonomous killer robots would take many forms    flying  driving  or just lying in wait. And actually  they're very quickly becoming a reality. These are two automatic sniper stations currently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea. Both of these machines are capable of automatically identifying a human target and firing on it  the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer. Now  in both cases  there's still a human in the loop to make that lethal firing decision  but it's not a technological requirement. It's a choice. And it's that choice that I want to focus on  because as we migrate lethal decision making from humans to software  we risk not only taking the humanity out of war  but also changing our social landscape entirely  far from the battlefield. That's because the way humans resolve conflict shapes our social landscape. And this has always been the case  throughout history. For example  these were state of the art weapons systems in      A.D. Now they were both very expensive to build and maintain  but with these you could dominate the populace  and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that. Power was focused at the very top. And what changed  Technological innovation. Gunpowder  cannon. And pretty soon  armor and castles were obsolete  and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield versus how many people you brought to the battlefield. And as armies grew in size  the nation state arose as a political and logistical requirement of defense. And as leaders had to rely on more of their populace  they began to share power. Representative government began to form. So again  the tools we use to resolve conflict shape our social landscape. Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool  except that  by requiring very few people to go to war  they risk re centralizing power into very few hands  possibly reversing a five century trend toward democracy. Now  I think  knowing this  we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions  to do what humans do best  which is adapt. But time is a factor. Seventy nations are developing remotely piloted combat drones of their own  and as you'll see  remotely piloted combat drones are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons. That's because once you've deployed remotely piloted drones  there are three powerful factors pushing decision making away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself. The first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce. For example  in       the U.S. drone fleet produced a grand total of    hours of video surveillance for analysis. By       this had gone up to         hours  outstripping human ability to review it all  but even that number is about to go up drastically. The Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programs will put up to    independently operated camera eyes on each drone platform  and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it. And that means visual intelligence software will need to scan it for items of interest. And that means very soon drones will tell humans what to look at  not the other way around. But there's a second powerful incentive pushing decision making away from humans and onto machines  and that's electromagnetic jamming  severing the connection between the drone and its operator. Now we saw an example of this in      when an American RQ     Sentinel drone got a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack  but any remotely piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack  and that means drones will have to shoulder more decision making. They'll know their mission objective  and they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance. They'll ignore external radio signals and send very few of their own. Which brings us to  really  the third and most powerful incentive pushing decision making away from humans and onto weapons  plausible deniability. Now we live in a global economy. High tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents. Cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs to parts unknown  and in that environment  it is very likely that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories  proliferate in the gray market. And in that situation  sifting through the wreckage of a suicide drone attack  it will be very difficult to say who sent that weapon. This raises the very real possibility of anonymous war. This could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head  make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower against an attacker  and that could shift the balance in the   st century away from defense and toward offense. It could make military action a viable option not just for small nations  but criminal organizations  private enterprise  even powerful individuals. It could create a landscape of rival warlords undermining rule of law and civil society. Now if responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones of representative government  autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both. Now you might be thinking that citizens of high tech nations would have the advantage in any robotic war  that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable  particularly against developing nations. But I think the truth is the exact opposite. I think citizens of high tech societies are more vulnerable to robotic weapons  and the reason can be summed up in one word  data. Data powers high tech societies. Cell phone geolocation  telecom metadata  social media  email  text  financial transaction data  transportation data  it's a wealth of real time data on the movements and social interactions of people. In short  we are more visible to machines than any people in history  and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons. What you're looking at here is a link analysis map of a social group. Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals. And these types of maps can be automatically generated based on the data trail modern people leave behind. Now it's typically used to market goods and services to targeted demographics  but it's a dual use technology  because targeting is used in another context. Notice that certain individuals are highlighted. These are the hubs of social networks. These are organizers  opinion makers  leaders  and these people also can be automatically identified from their communication patterns. Now  if you're a marketer  you might then target them with product samples  try to spread your brand through their social group. But if you're a repressive government searching for political enemies  you might instead remove them  eliminate them  disrupt their social group  and those who remain behind lose social cohesion and organization. Now in a world of cheap  proliferating robotic weapons  borders would offer very little protection to critics of distant governments or trans national criminal organizations. Popular movements agitating for change could be detected early and their leaders eliminated before their ideas achieve critical mass. And ideas achieving critical mass is what political activism in popular government is all about. Anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests. And this would put a chill on free speech and popular political action  the very heart of democracy. And this is why we need an international treaty on robotic weapons  and in particular a global ban on the development and deployment of killer robots. Now we already have international treaties on nuclear and biological weapons  and  while imperfect  these have largely worked. But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous  because they will almost certainly be used  and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions. Now in November      the U.S. Department of Defense issued a directive requiring a human being be present in all lethal decisions. This temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military  but that directive needs to be made permanent. And it could set the stage for global action. Because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons. And we need it now  before there's a devastating attack or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world to rush to adopt these weapons before thinking through the consequences. Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power in too few hands  and they would imperil democracy itself. Now  don't get me wrong  I think there are tons of great uses for unarmed civilian drones  environmental monitoring  search and rescue  logistics. If we have an international treaty on robotic weapons  how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones and vehicles while still protecting ourselves against illegal robotic weapons  I think the secret will be transparency. No robot should have an expectation of privacy in a public place. Each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed I.D. burned in at the factory that can be used to track its movement through public spaces. We have license plates on cars  tail numbers on aircraft. This is no different. And every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them  both right now and historically. And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones  and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down  they should notify humans to their presence. And in certain very high security areas  perhaps civic drones would snare them and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility. But notice  this is more an immune system than a weapons system. It would allow us to avail ourselves of the use of autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our open  civil society. We must ban the deployment and development of killer robots. Let's not succumb to the temptation to automate war. Autocratic governments and criminal organizations undoubtedly will  but let's not join them. Autonomous robotic weapons would concentrate too much power in too few unseen hands  and that would be corrosive to representative government. Let's make sure  for democracies at least  killer robots remain fiction. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone. You know that all over the world  people fight for their freedom  fight for their rights. Some battle oppressive governments. Others battle oppressive societies. Which battle do you think is harder  Allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes. Let me take you back two years ago in my life. It was the bedtime of my son  Aboody. He was five at the time. After finishing his bedtime rituals  he looked at me and he asked a question   Mommy  are we bad people   I was shocked.  Why do you say such things  Aboody   Earlier that day  I noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school. He wouldn't tell me what happened.  But now  he was ready to tell.  Two boys hit me today in school. They told me  'We saw your mom on Facebook. You and your mom should be put in jail.'  I've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything. I've been always a proud woman of my achievements. But those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth  when it all came together. You see  I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars. Just for giving me his car keys  my own brother was detained twice  and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist  leave the country with his wife and two year old son. My father had to sit in a Friday sermon listening to the imam condemning women drivers and calling them prostitutes amongst tons of worshippers  some of them our friends and family of my own father. I was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings  in the streets and in schools. It all hit me. It came into focus that those kids did not mean to be rude to my son. They were just influenced by the adults around them. And it wasn't about me  and it wasn't a punishment for taking the wheel and driving a few miles. It was a punishment for daring to challenge the society's rules. But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine. Allow me to give you a briefing about my story. It was May        and I was complaining to a work colleague about the harassments I had to face trying to find a ride back home  although I have a car and an international driver's license. As long as I've known  women in Saudi Arabia have been always complaining about the ban  but it's been    years since anyone tried to do anything about it  a whole generation ago. He broke the good bad news in my face.  But there is no law banning you from driving.  I looked it up  and he was right. There wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia. It was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women. That realization ignited the idea of June     where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive. It was a few weeks later  we started receiving all these  Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive.  A courageous woman  her name is Najla Hariri  she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah  she drove a car and she announced but she didn't record a video. We needed proof. So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube. And to my surprise  it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day. What happened next  of course  I started receiving threats to be killed  raped  just to stop this campaign. The Saudi authorities remained very quiet. That really creeped us out. I was in the campaign with other Saudi women and even men activists. We wanted to know how the authorities would respond on the actual day  June     when women go out and drive. So this time I asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car. It went fast. We were arrested  signed a pledge not to drive again  released. Arrested again  he was sent to detention for one day  and I was sent to jail. I wasn't sure why I was sent there  because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation. But what I was sure of was my innocence. I didn't break a law  and I kept my abaya   it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house   and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off  but I was so sure of my innocence  I kept saying   No  I'm leaving today.  Outside the jail  the whole country went into a frenzy  some attacking me badly  and others supportive and even collecting signatures in a petition to be sent to the king to release me. I was released after nine days. June    comes. The streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars  but some hundred brave Saudi women broke the ban and drove that day. None were arrested. We broke the taboo. So I think by now  everyone knows that we can't drive  or women are not allowed to drive  in Saudi Arabia  but maybe few know why. Allow me to help you answer this question. There was this official study that was presented to the Shura Council    it's the consultative council appointed by the king in Saudi Arabia   and it was done by a local professor  a university professor. He claims it's done based on a UNESCO study. And the study states  the percentage of rape  adultery  illegitimate children  even drug abuse  prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don't drive. I know  I was like this  I was shocked. I was like   We are the last country in the world where women don't drive.  So if you look at the map of the world  that only leaves two countries  Saudi Arabia  and the other society is the rest of the world. We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study  and it made headlines around the world.  BBC News  'End of virginity' if women drive  Saudi cleric warns  And only then we realized it's so empowering to mock your oppressor. It strips it away of its strongest weapon  fear. This system is based on ultra conservative traditions and customs that deal with women as if they are inferior and they need a guardian to protect them  so they need to take permission from this guardian  whether verbal or written  all their lives. We are minors until the day we die. And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law  or the religious laws. What's worst  when they become codified as laws in the system  and when women themselves believe in their inferiority  and they even fight those who try to question these rules. So for me  it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face. It was about living two totally different perceptions of my personality  of my person    the villain back in my home country  and the hero outside. Just to tell you  two stories happened in the last two years. One of them is when I was in jail. I'm pretty sure when I was in jail  everyone saw titles in the international media something like this during these nine days I was in jail. But in my home country  it was a totally different picture. It was more like this   Manal al Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order and inciting women to drive.  I know.  Manal al Sharif withdraws from the campaign.  Ah  it's okay. This is my favorite.  Manal al Sharif breaks down and confesses  'Foreign forces incited me.'  And it goes on  even trial and flogging me in public. So it's a totally different picture. I was asked last year to give a speech at the Oslo Freedom Forum. I was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me  and they looked at me as an inspiration. At the same time  I flew back to my home country  they hated that speech so much. The way they called it  a betrayal to the Saudi country and the Saudi people  and they even started a hashtag called  OsloTraitor on Twitter. Some        tweets were written in that hashtag  while the opposite hashtag   OsloHero  there was like a handful of tweets written. They even started a poll. More than        voters answered this poll  whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech. Ninety percent said yes  she's a traitor. So it's these two totally different perceptions of my personality. For me  I'm a proud Saudi woman  and I do love my country  and because I love my country  I'm doing this. Because I believe a society will not be free if the women of that society are not free. Thank you. Thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you. Thank you. But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you. I learned to be always there. The first thing  I got out of jail  of course after I took a shower  I went online  I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page  and I've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me. I would listen to what they say  and I would never defend myself with words only. I would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign  I filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate of traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license. There are a lot of people also    very big support  like those       people who signed the petition to release me. We sent a petition to the Shura Council in favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women  and there were  like        citizens who believed in that and they signed that petition. There were people like that  I just showed some examples  who are amazing  who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia  and trying  and they are also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views. Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women's rights. The Shura Council that's appointed by the king  by royal decree of King Abdullah  last year there were    women assigned to that Council  like    percent.    percent of the Council.  Applause  The same time  finally  that Council  after rejecting our petition four times for women driving  they finally accepted it last February. After being sent to jail or sentenced lashing  or sent to a trial  the spokesperson of the traffic police said  we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers. The Grand Mufti  who is the head of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia  he said  it's not recommended for women to drive. It used to be haram  forbidden  by the previous Grand Mufti. So for me  it's not about only these small steps. It's about women themselves. A friend once asked me  she said   So when do you think this women driving will happen   I told her   Only if women stop asking 'When ' and take action to make it now.  So it's not only about the system  it's also about us women to drive our own life  I'd say. So I have no clue  really  how I became an activist. And I don't know how I became one now. But all I know  and all I'm sure of  in the future when someone asks me my story  I will say   I'm proud to be amongst those women who lifted the ban  fought the ban  and celebrated everyone's freedom.  So the question I started my talk with  who do you think is more difficult to face  oppressive governments or oppressive societies  I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech. Thank you  everyone. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Once upon a time we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity. This was called the Great Moderation  the misguided belief by most economists  policymakers and central banks that we have transformed into a new world of never ending growth and prosperity. This was seen by robust and steady GDP growth  by low and controlled inflation  by low unemployment  and controlled and low financial volatility. But the Great Recession in      and       the great crash  broke this illusion. A few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector cascaded into five trillion dollars of losses in world GDP and almost     trillion losses in the global stock market. So the understanding of this Great Recession was that this was completely surprising  this came out of the blue  this was like the wrath of the gods. There was no responsibility. So  as a reflection of this  we started the Financial Crisis Observatory. We had the goal to diagnose in real time financial bubbles and identify in advance their critical time. What is the underpinning  scientifically  of this financial observatory  We developed a theory called  dragon kings.  Dragon kings represent extreme events which are of a class of their own. They are special. They are outliers. They are generated by specific mechanisms that may make them predictable  perhaps controllable. Consider the financial price time series  a given stock  your perfect stock  or a global index. You have these up and downs. A very good measure of the risk of this financial market is the peaks to valleys that represent a worst case scenario when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom. You can look at the statistics  the frequency of the occurrence of peak to valleys of different sizes  which is represented in this graph. Now  interestingly     percent of the peak to valleys of different amplitudes can be represented by a universal power law represented by this red line here. More interestingly  there are outliers  there are exceptions which are above this red line  occur     times more frequently  at least  than the extrapolation would predict them to occur based on the calibration of the    percent remaining peak to valleys. They are due to trenchant dependancies such that a loss is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss. These kinds of dependencies are largely missed by standard risk management tools  which ignore them and see lizards when they should see dragon kings. The root mechanism of a dragon king is a slow maturation towards instability  which is the bubble  and the climax of the bubble is often the crash. This is similar to the slow heating of water in this test tube reaching the boiling point  where the instability of the water occurs and you have the phase transition to vapor. And this process  which is absolutely non linear    cannot be predicted by standard techniques    is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior which is fundamentally endogenous. So the cause of the crash  the cause of the crisis has to be found in an inner instability of the system  and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur. Now  some of you may have come to the mind that is this not related to the black swan concept you have heard about frequently  Remember  black swan is this rare bird that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief that all swans should be white  so it has captured the idea of unpredictability  unknowability  that the extreme events are fundamentally unknowable. Nothing can be further from the dragon king concept I propose  which is exactly the opposite  that most extreme events are actually knowable and predictable. So we can be empowered and take responsibility and make predictions about them. So let's have my dragon king burn this black swan concept. There are many early warning signals that are predicted by this theory. Let me just focus on one of them  the super exponential growth with positive feedback. What does it mean  Imagine you have an investment that returns the first year five percent  the second year    percent  the third year    percent  the next year    percent. Is that not marvelous  This is a super exponential growth. A standard exponential growth corresponds to a constant growth rate  let's say  of    percent The point is that  many times during bubbles  there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times  such that previous growths enhance  push forward  increase the next growth through this kind of super exponential growth  which is very trenchant  not sustainable. And the key idea is that the mathematical solution of this class of models exhibit finite time singularities  which means that there is a critical time where the system will break  will change regime. It may be a crash. It may be just a plateau  something else. And the key idea is that the critical time  the information about the critical time is contained in the early development of this super exponential growth. We have applied this theory early on  that was our first success  to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements on the iron rocket. Using acoustic emission  you know  this little noise that you hear a structure emit  sing to you when they are stressed  and reveal the damage going on  there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback  the more damage gives the more damage  so you can actually predict  within  of course  a probability band  when the rupture will occur. So this is now so successful that it is used in the initial phase of  unclear  the flight. Perhaps more surprisingly  the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine  parturition  the act of giving birth  epileptic seizures. From seven months of pregnancy  a mother starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus that are the sign of these maturations toward the instability  giving birth to the baby  the dragon king. So if you measure the precursor signal  you can actually identify pre  and post maturity problems in advance. Epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size  and when the brain goes to a super critical state  you have dragon kings which have a degree of predictability and this can help the patient to deal with this illness. We have applied this theory to many systems  landslides  glacier collapse  even to the dynamics of prediction of success  blockbusters  YouTube videos  movies  and so on. But perhaps the most important application is for finance  and this theory illuminates  I believe  the deep reason for the financial crisis that we have gone through. This is rooted in    years of history of bubbles  starting in       with the global bubble crashing in       followed by many other bubbles. The biggest one was the  new economy  Internet bubble in       crashing in       the real estate bubbles in many countries  financial derivative bubbles everywhere  stock market bubbles also everywhere  commodity and all bubbles  debt and credit bubbles    bubbles  bubbles  bubbles. We had a global bubble. This is a measure of global overvaluation of all markets  expressing what I call an illusion of a perpetual money machine that suddenly broke in     . The problem is that we see the same process  in particular through quantitative easing  of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays to tackle the crisis since      in the U.S.  in Europe  in Japan. This has very important implications to understand the failure of quantitative easing as well as austerity measures as long as we don't attack the core  the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking. Now  these are big claims. Why would you believe me  Well  perhaps because  in the last    years we have come out of our ivory tower  and started to publish ex ante    and I stress the term ex ante  it means  in advance    before the crash confirmed the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses. These are a few of the major bubbles that we have lived through in recent history. Again  many interesting stories for each of them. Let me tell you just one or two stories that deal with massive bubbles. We all know the Chinese miracle. This is the expression of the stock market of a massive bubble  a factor of three      percent in just a few years. In September       I was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund management conference  and I showed to the conference a prediction that by the end of       this bubble would change regime. There might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable. Now  how do you believe the very smart  very motivated  very informed macro hedge fund managers reacted to this prediction  You know  they had made billions just surfing this bubble until now. They told me   Didier  yeah  the market might be overvalued  but you forget something. There is the Beijing Olympic Games coming in August       and it's very clear that the Chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also avoid any wave and control the stock market.  Three weeks after my presentation  the markets lost    percent and went through a phase of volatility  upheaval  and a total market loss of    percent until the end of the year. So how can we be so collectively wrong by misreading or ignoring the science of the fact that when an instability has developed  and the system is ripe  any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control  The Chinese market collapsed  but it rebounded. In       we also identified that this new bubble  a smaller one  was unsustainable  so we published again a prediction  in advance  stating that by August       the market will correct  will not continue on this track. Our critics  reading the prediction  said   No  it's not possible. The Chinese government is there. They have learned their lesson. They will control. They want to benefit from the growth.  Perhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously. So the crisis did occur. The market corrected. The same critics then said   Ah  yes  but you published your prediction. You influenced the market. It was not a prediction.  Maybe I am very powerful then. Now  this is interesting. It shows that it's essentially impossible until now to develop a science of economics because we are sentient beings who anticipate and there is a problem of self fulfilling prophesies. So we invented a new way of doing science. We created the Financial Bubble Experiment. The idea is the following. We monitor the markets. We identify excesses  bubbles. We do our work. We write a report in which we put our prediction of the critical time. We don't release the report. It's kept secret. But with modern encrypting techniques  we have a hash  we publish a public key  and six months later  we release the report  and there is authentication. And all this is done on an international archive so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes. Let me tease you with a very recent analysis.   th of May        just two weeks ago  we identified that the U.S. stock market was on an unsustainable path and we released this on our website on the   st of May that there will be a change of regime. The next day  the market started to change regime  course. This is not a crash. This is just the third or fourth act of a massive bubble in the making. Scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet  we see the same thing. Wherever we look  it's observable  in the biosphere  in the atmosphere  in the ocean  showing these super exponential trajectories characterizing an unsustainable path and announcing a phase transition. This diagram on the right shows a very beautiful compilation of studies suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear    possibility for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades. So there are bubbles everywhere. From one side  this is exciting for me  as a professor who chases bubbles and slays dragons  as the media has sometimes called me. But can we really slay the dragons  Very recently  with collaborators  we studied a dynamical system where you see the dragon king as these big loops and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times that removed  when control is on  these dragons.  Gouverner  c'est pr voir.  Governing is the art of planning and predicting. But is it not the case that this is probably one of the biggest gaps of mankind  which has the responsibility to steer our societies and our planet toward sustainability in the face of growing challenges and crises  But the dragon king theory gives hope. We learn that most systems have pockets of predictability. It is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises so that we can be prepared  we can take measures  we can take responsibility  and so that never again will extremes and crises like the Great Recession or the European crisis take us by surprise. Thank you. Living in Africa is to be on the edge  metaphorically  and quite literally when you think about connectivity before     . Though many human intellectual and technological leaps had happened in Europe and the rest of the world  but Africa was sort of cut off. And that changed  first with ships when we had the Renaissance  the Scientific Revolution and also the Industrial Revolution. And now we've got the digital revolution. These revolutions have not been evenly distributed across continents and nations. Never have been. Now  this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables that connect Africa to the rest of the world. What I find amazing is that Africa is transcending its geography problem. Africa is connecting to the rest of the world and within itself. The connectivity situation has improved greatly  but some barriers remain. It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be. In       one of the problems that we faced was lack of information flow. There was a media blackout in       when there was post election violence in Kenya. It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time. So we came together and we created software called Ushahidi. And Ushahidi means  testimony  or  witness  in Swahili. I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators. This is David and Erik. I call them brothers from another mother. Clearly I have a German mother somewhere. And we worked together first with building and growing Ushahidi. And the idea of the software was to gather information from SMS  email and web  and put a map so that you could see what was happening where  and you could visualize that data. And after that initial prototype  we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did. All the while  we also wanted to give back to the local tech community that helped us grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days. And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi  an actual physical space where we could collaborate  and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya. We did that with the support of different organizations like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network. And we were able to grow this software footprint  and a few years later it became very useful software  and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti where citizens could indicate where they are and what their needs were  and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis and the tsunami in Japan. Now  this year the Internet turns     and Ushahidi turned five. Ushahidi is not only the software that we made. It is the team  and it's also the community that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee. We did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world. There are crisis maps  election maps  corruption maps  and even environmental monitoring crowd maps. We are humbled that this has roots in Kenya and that it has some use to people around the world trying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with. There is more that we're doing to explore this idea of collective intelligence  that I  as a citizen  if I share the information with whatever device that I have  could inform you about what is going on  and that if you do the same  we can have a bigger picture of what's going on. I moved back to Kenya in     . Erik moved in     . Very different reality. I used to live in Chicago where there was abundant Internet access. I had never had to deal with a blackout. And in Kenya  it's a very different reality  and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress and the digital revolution is the electricity problem. The day to day frustrations of dealing with this can be  let's just say very annoying. Blackouts are not fun. Imagine sitting down to start working  and all of a sudden the power goes out  your Internet connection goes down with it  so you have to figure out  okay  now  where's the modem  how do I switch back  And then  guess what  You have to deal with it again. Now  this is the reality of Kenya  where we live now  and other parts of Africa. The other problem that we're facing is that communication costs are also still a challenge. It costs me five Kenyan shillings  or .   USD to call the U.S.  Canada or China. Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda  Ghana  Nigeria  Thirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost to connect within Africa. And also  when traveling within Africa  you've got different settings for different mobile providers. This is the reality that we deal with. So we've got a joke in Ushahidi where we say   If it works in Africa  it'll work anywhere.   Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.  What if we could overcome the problem of unreliable Internet and electricity and reduce the cost of connection  Could we leverage the cloud  We've built a crowd map  we've built Ushahidi. Could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country  So we looked at the modem  an important part of the infrastructure of the Internet  and asked ourselves why the modems that we are using right now are built for a different context  where you've got ubiquitous internet  you've got ubiquitous electricity  yet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury. We wanted to redesign the modem for the developing world  for our context  and for our reality. What if we could have connectivity with less friction  This is the BRCK. It acts as a backup to the Internet so that  when the power goes out  it fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network. Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive. It's actually everywhere. Most towns at least have a  G connection. So why don't we leverage that  And that's why we built this. The other reason that we built this is when electricity goes down  this has eight hours of battery left  so you can continue working  you can continue being productive  and let's just say you are less stressed. And for rural areas  it can be the primary means of connection. The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play when we wondered how can we use the cloud to be more intelligent so that you can analyze the different networks  and whenever you switch on the backup  you pick on the fastest network  so we'll have multi SIM capability so that you can put multiple SIMs  and if one network is faster  that's the one you hop on  and if the up time on that is not very good  then you hop onto the next one. The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere. With load balancing  this can be possible. The other interesting thing for us    we like sensors    is this idea that you could have an on ramp for the Internet of things. Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this. It's built in a modular way so that you can also attach a satellite module so that you could have Internet connectivity even in very remote areas. Out of adversity can come innovation  and how can we help the ambitious coders and makers in Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure  And for us  we begin with solving the problem in our own backyard in Kenya. It is not without challenge. Our team has basically been mules carrying components from the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations with customs border agents.  What are you carrying   And the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects. So we put it on Kickstarter  and I'm happy to say that  through the support of many people  not only here but online  the BRCK has been Kickstarted  and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins. I will close by saying that  if we solve this for the local market  it could be impactful not only for the coders in Nairobi but also for small business owners who need reliable connectivity  and it can reduce the cost of connecting  and hopefully collaboration within African countries. The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy are connectivity and entrepreneurship. The BRCK is our part to keep Africans connected  and to help them drive the global digital revolution. Thank you. I was born and raised in North Korea. Although my family constantly struggled against poverty  I was always loved and cared for first  because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family. But then the great famine began in     . I was four years old. My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at   in the morning and come back after midnight. I would wander the streets searching for food  and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother's back eating chips  and wanting to steal them from him. Hunger is humiliation. Hunger is hopelessness. For a hungry child  politics and freedom are not even thought of. On my ninth birthday  my parents couldn't give me any food to eat. But even as a child  I could feel the heaviness in their hearts. Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time  and in       when I was    years old  my father became one of them. I saw my father wither away and die. In the same year  my mother disappeared one day  and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money  but that she would return with money and food soon. Since we had never been separated  and I thought we would be together forever  I didn't even give her a hug when she left. It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. But again  I didn't know it was going to be a long goodbye. I have not seen my mom or my sister since then. Suddenly  I became an orphan and homeless. My daily life became very hard  but very simple. My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash. But that is no way to survive. I started to realize  begging would not be the solution. So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets. Sometimes  I found small jobs in exchange for food. Once  I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine     meters underground without any protection for up to    hours a day. I was not uncommon. Many other orphans survived this way  or worse. When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains  I hoped that  the next morning  my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food. That hope kept me alive. I don't mean big  grand hope. I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread  even though it usually didn't. But if I didn't believe it  I wouldn't even try  and then I would die. Hope kept me alive. Every day  I told myself  no matter how hard things got  still I must live. After three years of waiting for my sister's return  I decided to go to China to look for her myself. I realized I couldn't survive much longer this way. I knew the journey would be risky  but I would be risking my life either way. I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea  or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China. I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen. North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission. Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans  where they face severe punishment. I decided to cross during the day  first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark  second because I knew I was already taking a risk  and since not many people tried to cross during the day  I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone. I made it to China on February         . I was    years old. I thought things in China would be easier  since there was more food. I thought more people would help me. But it was harder than living in North Korea  because I was not free. I was always worried about being caught and sent back. By a miracle  some months later  I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans  and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years. Later that year  an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee. I went to America without knowing a word of English  yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school. Even in North Korea  I was an F student. And I barely finished elementary school. And I remember I fought in school more than once a day. Textbooks and the library were not my playground. My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying  but it didn't work. At one point  my father gave up on me. He said   You're not my son anymore.  I was only    or     but it hurt me deeply. But nevertheless  my level of motivation still didn't change before he died. So in America  it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school. I didn't even go to middle school. I decided to go  just because they told me to  without trying much. But one day  I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner. And during dinner  I wanted to have one more wing  but I realized there were not enough for everyone  so I decided against it. When I looked down at my plate  I saw the last chicken wing  that my foster father had given me his. I was so happy. I looked at him sitting next to me. He just looked back at me very warmly  but said no words. Suddenly I remembered my biological father. My foster father's small act of love reminded me of my father  who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry  even if he was starving. I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America  yet my father died of starvation. My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him  and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him. And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice. I took school seriously  and for the first time ever in my life  I received an academic award for excellence  and made dean's list from the first semester in high school. That chicken wing changed my life. Hope is personal. Hope is something that no one can give to you. You have to choose to believe in hope. You have to make it yourself. In North Korea  I made it myself. Hope brought me to America. But in America  I didn't know what to do  because I had this overwhelming freedom. My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction  and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America. I did not come here by myself. I had hope  but hope by itself is not enough. Many people helped me along the way to get here. North Koreans are fighting hard to survive. They have to force themselves to survive  have hope to survive  but they cannot make it without help. This is my message to you. Have hope for yourself  but also help each other. Life can be hard for everyone  wherever you live. My foster father didn't intend to change my life. In the same way  you may also change someone's life with even the smallest act of love. A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger  and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive. But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph's life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive. Thank you. Adrian Hong  Joseph  thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us. I know you haven't seen your sister for  you said  it was almost exactly a decade  and in the off chance that she may be able to see this  we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message. Joseph Kim  In Korean  AH  You can do English  then Korean as well. JK  Okay  I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don't think I can make it without tearing up. Nuna  it has been already    years that I haven t seen you. I just wanted to say that I miss you  and I love you  and please come back to me and stay alive. And I    oh  gosh. I still haven't given up my hope to see you. I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you  and I promise I will not cry again. Yes  I'm just looking forward to seeing you  and if you can't find me  I will also look for you  and I hope to see you one day. And can I also make a small message to my mom  AH  Sure  please. JK  I haven't spent much time with you  but I know that you still love me  and you probably still pray for me and think about me. I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world. Thank you. The idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal. I don't think anyone in this room would disagree. What worries me is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars    use the words    ... it all just sounds so  so simple.  Now  I've got no bucket of money today and I've got no policy to release  and I certainly haven't got a guitar. I'll leave that to others. But I do have an idea  and that idea is called Housing for Health. Housing for Health works with poor people. It works in the places where they live  and the work is done to improve their health. Over the last    years  this tough  grinding  dirty work has been done by literally thousands of people around Australia and  more recently  overseas  and their work has proven that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments. It can improve health and it can play a part in reducing  if not eliminating  poverty. I'm going to start where the story began          in Central Australia. A man called Yami Lester  an Aboriginal man  was running a health service. Eighty percent of what walked in the door  in terms of illness  was infectious disease    third world  developing world infectious disease  caused by a poor living environment. Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs. He got a medical doctor. He got an environmental health guy. And he hand selected a team of local Aboriginal people to work on this project. Yami told us at that first meeting   There's no money      always a good start      ... no money  you have six months  and I want you to start on a project     which  in his language  he called  Uwankara Palyanku Kanyintjaku   which  translated  is  a plan to stop people getting sick     a profound brief. That was our task. First step  the medical doctor went away for about six months. And he worked on what were to become these nine health goals    what were we aiming at  After six months of work  he came to my office and presented me with those nine words on a piece of paper.  The   Healthy Living Practices  Washing  clothes  wastewater  nutrition  crowding  animals  dust  temperature  injury  I was very unimpressed. Big ideas need big words  and preferably a lot of them. This didn't fit the bill. What I didn't see and what you can't see was that he'd assembled thousands of pages of local  national and international health research that filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets. The pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason. The Aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people were most commonly illiterate  so the story had to be told in pictures of what these goals were. We worked with the community  not telling them what was going to happen in a language they didn't understand. So we had the goals and each one of these goals    and I won't go through them all    puts at the center the person and their health issue  and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their health good. And the highest priority  you see on the screen  is washing people once a day  particularly children. And I hope most of you are thinking   What  That sounds simple.  Now  I'm going to ask you all a very personal question. This morning before you came  who could have had a wash using a shower  I'm not going to ask if you had a shower  because I'm too polite. That's it. All right  I think it's fair to say most people here could have had a shower this morning. I'm going to ask you to do some more work. I want you all to select one of the houses of the    houses you see on the screen. I want you to select one of them and note the position of that house and keep that in your head. Have you all got a house  I'm going to ask you to live there for a few months  so make sure you've got it right. It's in the northwest of Western Australia  very pleasant place. OK. Let's see if your shower in that house is working. I hear some  Aw   and I hear some  Ah   If you get a green tick  your shower's working. You and your kids are fine. If you get a red cross  well  I've looked carefully around the room and it's not going to make much difference to this crew. Why  Because you're all too old. I know that's going to come as a shock to some of you  but you are. And before you get offended and leave  I've got to say that being too old  in this case  means that pretty much everyone in the room  I think  is over five years of age. We're really concerned with kids naught to five. And why  Washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs  the common infectious diseases of the eyes  the ears  the chest and the skin that  if they occur in the first five years of life  permanently damage those organs. They leave a lifelong remnant. That means that by the age of five  you can't see as well for the rest of your life. You can't hear as well for the rest of your life. You can't breathe as well. You've lost a third of your lung capacity by the age of five. And even skin infection  which we originally thought wasn't that big a problem  mild skin infections naught to five give you a greatly increased chance of renal failure  needing dialysis at age   . This is a big deal  so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids. Those ticks and crosses represent the       houses we've looked at nationally around Australia  the same proportion. What you see on the screen       percent of those not so famous houses lived in by        indigenous people       percent had a working shower. Ten percent of those same       houses had safe electrical systems. And    percent of those houses had a working toilet. These are by a simple  standard test. In the case of the shower  does it have hot and cold water  two taps that work  a shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body  and a drain that takes the water away  Not well designed  not beautiful  not elegant    just that they function. And the same tests for the electrical system and the toilets. Housing for Health projects aren't about measuring failure    they're actually about improving houses. We start on day one of every project. We've learned    we don't make promises  we don't do reports. We arrive in the morning with tools  tons of equipment  trades  and we train up a local team on the first day to start work. By the evening of the first day  a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning. That work continues for six to    months  until all the houses are improved and we've spent our budget of       dollars total per house. That's our average budget. At the end of six months to a year  we test every house again. It's very easy to spend money. It's very difficult to improve the function of all those parts of the house. And for a whole house  the nine healthy living practices  we test  check and fix     items in every house. And these are the results we can get with our       dollars. We can get showers up to    percent working  we can get electrical systems up to    percent working and we can get    percent of toilets working in those       houses. Thank you. The teams do a great job  and that's their work. I think there's an obvious question that I hope you're thinking about. Why do we have to do this work  Why are the houses in such poor condition  Seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance    the sort of things that happen in all our houses. Things wear out  should have been done by state government or local government  simply not done  the house doesn't work. Twenty one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction    literally things that are built upside down and back to front. They don't work  we have to fix them. And if you've lived in Australia in the last    years  the final cause    you will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses. It's one of the almost rock solid pieces of evidence which I've never seen evidence for  that's always reeled out as  That's the problem with indigenous housing.  Well  nine percent of what we spend is damage  misuse or abuse of any sort. We argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem. And we'll go a lot further than that  the people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution. Seventy five percent of our national team in Australia    over    at the minute    are actually local  indigenous people from the communities we work in. They do all aspects of the work. In       for example  there were      all over Australia  and the Torres Strait Islands  all states  working to improve the houses where they and their families live  and that's an important thing. Our work's always had a focus on health. That's the key. The developing world bug  trachoma  causes blindness. It's a developing world illness  and yet  the picture you see behind is in an Aboriginal community in the late     s  where    percent of school aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes  doing damage. OK  what do we do  Well  first thing we do  we get showers working. Why  Because that flushes the bug out. We put washing facilities in the school as well  so kids can wash their faces many times during the day. We wash the bug out. Second  the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye and lets the bug in quick. So what do we do  We call up the doctor of dust  and there is such a person. He was loaned to us by a mining company. He controls dust on mining company sites. And he came out and  within a day  it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground  the wind driven dust    so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids. So we used dirt to stop dust. We did it. He provided us dust monitors. We tested and we reduced the dust. Then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally. So how do we do that  Well  we call up the doctor of flies    and  yes  there is a doctor of flies. As our Aboriginal mate said   You white fellows ought to get out more.  And the doctor of flies very quickly determined that there was one fly that carried the bug. He could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide. They could trap the flies  send them to him in Perth. When the bug was in the gut  he'd send back by return post some dung beetles. The dung beetles ate the camel dung  the flies died through lack of food  and trachoma dropped. And over the year  trachoma dropped radically in this place  and stayed low. We changed the environment  not just treated the eyes. And finally  you get a good eye. All these small health gains and small pieces of the puzzle make a big difference. The New South Wales Department of Health  that radical organization  did an independent trial over three years to look at    years of the work we've been doing in these sorts of projects in New South Wales. And they found a    percent reduction in hospital admissions for the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment    a    percent reduction. Just to show that the principles we've used in Australia can be used in other places  I'm just going to go to one other place  and that's Nepal. And what a beautiful place to go. We were asked by a small village of     people to go in and make toilets where none existed. Health was poor. We went in with no grand plan  no grand promises of a great program  just the offer to build two toilets for two families. It was during the design of the first toilet that I went for lunch  invited by the family into their main room of the house. It was choking with smoke. People were cooking on their only fuel source  green timber. The smoke coming off that timber is choking  and in an enclosed house  you simply can't breathe. Later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through respiratory failure. So all of a sudden  we had two problems. We were there originally to look at toilets and get human waste off the ground  that's fine. But all of a sudden now there was a second problem  How do we actually get the smoke down  So two problems  and design should be about more than one thing. Solution  Take human waste  take animal waste  put it into a chamber  out of that  extract biogas  methane gas. The gas gives three to four hours cooking a day    clean  smokeless and free for the family. I put it to you  is this eliminating poverty  And the answer from the Nepali team who's working at the minute would say  don't be ridiculous    we have three million more toilets to build before we can even make a stab at that claim. And I don't pretend anything else. But as we all sit here today  there are now over     toilets built in this village and a couple nearby. Well over       people use those toilets. Yami Lama  he's a young boy. He's got significantly less gut infection because he's now got toilets  and there isn't human waste on the ground. Kanji Maya  she's a mother  and a proud one. She's probably right now cooking lunch for her family on biogas  smokeless fuel. Her lungs have got better  and they'll get better as time increases  because she's not cooking in the same smoke. Surya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber when it's shed the gas  he puts it on his crops. He's trebled his crop income  more food for the family and more money for the family. And finally Bishnu  the leader of the team  has now understood that not only have we built toilets  we've also built a team  and that team is now working in two villages where they're training up the next two villages to keep the work expanding. And that  to me  is the key. People are not the problem. We've never found that. The problem  poor living environment  poor housing and the bugs that do people harm. None of those are limited by geography  by skin color or by religion. None of them. The common link between all the work we've had to do is one thing  and that's poverty. Nelson Mandela said  in the mid     s  not too far from here  he said that like slavery and apartheid   Poverty is not natural. It is man made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.  I want to end by saying it's been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings doing    I think    extraordinary work  that have actually improved health  and  maybe only in a small way  reduced poverty. Thank you very much for your time. Everything is interconnected. As a Shinnecock Indian  I was raised to know this. We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York. When I was a little girl  my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day. There were no clouds in the sky. And after a while I began to perspire. And he pointed up to the sky  and he said   Look  do you see that  That's part of you up there. That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals.  In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life  I started storm chasing in      after my daughter said   Mom  you should do that.  And so three days later  driving very fast  I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell  capable of producing grapefruit size hail and spectacular tornadoes  although only two percent actually do. These clouds can grow so big  up to    miles wide and reach up to        feet into the atmosphere. They can grow so big  blocking all daylight  making it very dark and ominous standing under them. Storm chasing is a very tactile experience. There's a warm  moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth  the wheat  the grass  the charged particles. And then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming  the greens and the turquoise blues. I've learned to respect the lightning. My hair used to be straight. I'm just kidding. What really excites me about these storms is their movement  the way they swirl and spin and undulate  with their lava lamp like mammatus clouds. They become lovely monsters. When I'm photographing them  I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson. As I stand under them  I see not just a cloud  but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces  the same process in a small scale version that helped to create our galaxy  our solar system  our sun and even this very planet. All my relations. Thank you. Writing biography is a strange thing to do. It's a journey into the foreign territory of somebody else's life  a journey  an exploration that can take you places you never dreamed of going and still can't quite believe you've been  especially if  like me  you're an agnostic Jew and the life you've been exploring is that of Muhammad. Five years ago  for instance  I found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle to what I knew was an impossible question  What actually happened one desert night  half the world and almost half of history away  What happened  that is  on the night in the year     when Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran on a mountain just outside Mecca  This is the core mystical moment of Islam  and as such  of course  it defies empirical analysis. Yet the question wouldn't let go of me. I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am  just asking it could be seen as pure chutzpah. And I plead guilty as charged  because all exploration  physical or intellectual  is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression  of crossing boundaries. Still  some boundaries are larger than others. So a human encountering the divine  as Muslims believe Muhammad did  to the rationalist  this is a matter not of fact but of wishful fiction  and like all of us  I like to think of myself as rational. Which might be why when I looked at the earliest accounts we have of that night  what struck me even more than what happened was what did not happen. Muhammad did not come floating off the mountain as though walking on air. He did not run down shouting   Hallelujah   and  Bless the Lord   He did not radiate light and joy. There were no choirs of angels  no music of the spheres  no elation  no ecstasy  no golden aura surrounding him  no sense of an absolute  fore ordained role as the messenger of God. That is  he did none of the things that might make it easy to cry foul  to put down the whole story as a pious fable. Quite the contrary. In his own reported words  he was convinced at first that what had happened couldn't have been real. At best  he thought  it had to have been a hallucination    a trick of the eye or the ear  perhaps  or his own mind working against him. At worst  possession    that he'd been seized by an evil jinn  a spirit out to deceive him  even to crush the life out of him. In fact  he was so sure that he could only be majnun  possessed by a jinn  that when he found himself still alive  his first impulse was to finish the job himself  to leap off the highest cliff and escape the terror of what he'd experienced by putting an end to all experience. So the man who fled down the mountain that night trembled not with joy but with a stark  primordial fear. He was overwhelmed not with conviction  but by doubt. And that panicked disorientation  that sundering of everything familiar  that daunting awareness of something beyond human comprehension  can only be called a terrible awe. This might be somewhat difficult to grasp now that we use the word  awesome  to describe a new app or a viral video. With the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake  we're protected from real awe. We close the doors and hunker down  convinced that we're in control  or  at least  hoping for control. We do our best to ignore the fact that we don't always have it  and that not everything can be explained. Yet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic  whether you think the words Muhammad heard that night came from inside himself or from outside  what's clear is that he did experience them  and that he did so with a force that would shatter his sense of himself and his world and transform this otherwise modest man into a radical advocate for social and economic justice. Fear was the only sane response  the only human response. Too human for some  like conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that the account of his wanting to kill himself shouldn't even be mentioned  despite the fact that it's in the earliest Islamic biographies. They insist that he never doubted for even a single moment  let alone despaired. Demanding perfection  they refuse to tolerate human imperfection. Yet what  exactly  is imperfect about doubt  As I read those early accounts  I realized it was precisely Muhammad's doubt that brought him alive for me  that allowed me to begin to see him in full  to accord him the integrity of reality. And the more I thought about it  the more it made sense that he doubted  because doubt is essential to faith. If this seems a startling idea at first  consider that doubt  as Graham Greene once put it  is the heart of the matter. Abolish all doubt  and what's left is not faith  but absolute  heartless conviction. You're certain that you possess the Truth    inevitably offered with an implied uppercase T    and this certainty quickly devolves into dogmatism and righteousness  by which I mean a demonstrative  overweening pride in being so very right  in short  the arrogance of fundamentalism. It has to be one of the multiple ironies of history that a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists is the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists known as Crusaders   infidel   from the Latin for  faithless.  Doubly ironic  in this case  because their absolutism is in fact the opposite of faith. In effect  they are the infidels. Like fundamentalists of all religious stripes  they have no questions  only answers. They found the perfect antidote to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith. They don't have to struggle for it like Jacob wrestling through the night with the angel  or like Jesus in his    days and nights in the wilderness  or like Muhammad  not only that night on the mountain  but throughout his years as a prophet  with the Koran constantly urging him not to despair  and condemning those who most loudly proclaim that they know everything there is to know and that they and they alone are right. And yet we  the vast and still far too silent majority  have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority. We've allowed Judaism to be claimed by violently messianic West Bank settlers  Christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots  Islam by suicide bombers. And we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that no matter whether they claim to be Christians  Jews or Muslims  militant extremists are none of the above. They're a cult all their own  blood brothers steeped in other people's blood. This isn't faith. It's fanaticism  and we have to stop confusing the two. We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers. It's difficult and stubborn. It involves an ongoing struggle  a continual questioning of what we think we know  a wrestling with issues and ideas. It goes hand in hand with doubt  in a never ending conversation with it  and sometimes in conscious defiance of it. And this conscious defiance is why I  as an agnostic  can still have faith. I have faith  for instance  that peace in the Middle East is possible despite the ever accumulating mass of evidence to the contrary. I'm not convinced of this. I can hardly say I believe it. I can only have faith in it  commit myself  that is  to the idea of it  and I do this precisely because of the temptation to throw up my hands in resignation and retreat into silence. Because despair is self fulfilling. If we call something impossible  we act in such a way that we make it so. And I  for one  refuse to live that way. In fact  most of us do  whether we're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond  for that matter  what drives us is that  despite our doubts and even because of our doubts  we reject the nihilism of despair. We insist on faith in the future and in each other. Call this naive if you like. Call it impossibly idealistic if you must. But one thing is sure  Call it human. Could Muhammad have so radically changed his world without such faith  without the refusal to cede to the arrogance of closed minded certainty  I think not. After keeping company with him as a writer for the past five years  I can't see that he'd be anything but utterly outraged at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak and act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today. He'd be appalled at the repression of half the population because of their gender. He'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism. He'd call out terrorism for what it is  not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he believed in and struggled for. He'd say what the Koran says  Anyone who takes a life takes the life of all humanity. Anyone who saves a life  saves the life of all humanity. And he'd commit himself fully to the hard and thorny process of making peace. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  I'll never forget that day back in the spring of     . I was a surgical resident at The Johns Hopkins Hospital  taking emergency call. I got paged by the E.R. around   in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot. I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as I pulled the curtain back to see her. And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital. That wasn't being asked. The question that was being asked of me was a different one  which was  did she also need an amputation  Now  looking back on that night  I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I'd shown the    year old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer. In her case  I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to save her life. The cancer was too advanced. But I was committed to making sure that I could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee. I brought some for her parents. But more importantly  see  I passed no judgment on her  because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself. So why was it that  just a few nights later  as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation  why did I hold her in such bitter contempt  You see  unlike the woman the night before  this woman had type   diabetes. She was fat. And we all know that's from eating too much and not exercising enough  right  I mean  how hard can it be  As I looked down at her in the bed  I thought to myself  if you just tried caring even a little bit  you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you've never met about to amputate your foot. Why did I feel justified in judging her  I'd like to say I don't know. But I actually do. You see  in the hubris of my youth  I thought I had her all figured out. She ate too much. She got unlucky. She got diabetes. Case closed. Ironically  at that time in my life  I was also doing cancer research  immune based therapies for melanoma  to be specific  and in that world I was actually taught to question everything  to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards. Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma  I never once questioned the conventional wisdom. I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science. Three years later  I found out how wrong I was. But this time  I was the patient. Despite exercising three or four hours every single day  and following the food pyramid to the letter  I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome. Some of you may have heard of this. I had become insulin resistant. You can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat  whether we burn it or store it. This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo. Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life. And insulin resistance  as its name suggests  is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job. Once you're insulin resistant  you're on your way to getting diabetes  which is what happens when your pancreas can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin. Now your blood sugar levels start to rise  and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease  cancer  even Alzheimer's disease  and amputations  just like that woman a few years earlier. With that scare  I got busy changing my diet radically  adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking. I did this and lost    pounds  weirdly while exercising less. I  as you can see  I guess I'm not overweight anymore. More importantly  I don't have insulin resistance. But most important  I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away  How did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right  If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me  was it possible it was failing someone else  And underlying these questions  I became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance. Now  most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance. Logically  then  if you want to treat insulin resistance  you get people to lose weight  right  You treat the obesity. But what if we have it backwards  What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all  In fact  what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem  the tip of a proverbial iceberg  I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic  but hear me out. What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell  I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign  but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils. You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of our cells to partition fuel  as I alluded to a moment ago  taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately. When we become insulin resistant  the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state. So now  when insulin says to a cell  I want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe  the cell  in effect  says   No thanks  I'd actually rather store this energy.  And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells  it's probably the safest place to store it. So for many of us  about    million Americans  the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat  not the reverse  getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat. This is a really subtle distinction  but the implication could be profound. Consider the following analogy  Think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table. Sure  the bruise hurts like hell  and you almost certainly don't like the discolored look  but we all know the bruise per Se is not the problem. In fact  it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma  all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body. Now  imagine we thought bruises were the problem  and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises  masking creams  painkillers  you name it  all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables. How much better would we be if we treated the cause    telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room    rather than the effect  Getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world. Getting it wrong  and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins. Cause and effect. So what I'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance. Maybe we should be asking ourselves  is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity  at least in most people  What if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening  an underlying epidemic  the one we ought to be worried about  Let's look at some suggestive facts. We know that    million obese Americans in the United States don't have insulin resistance. And by the way  they don't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people. Conversely  we know that six million lean people in the United States are insulin resistant  and by the way  they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts. Now I don't know why  but it might be because  in their case  their cells haven't actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy. So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance  and you can be lean and have it  this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what's going on. So what if we're fighting the wrong war  fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance  Even worse  what if blaming the obese means we're blaming the victims  What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong  Personally  I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore  let alone the luxury of certainty. I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this  but I'm wide open to others. Now  my hypothesis  because everybody always asks me  is this. If you ask yourself  what's a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant  the answer probably isn't too much food. It's more likely too much glucose  blood sugar. Now  we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run  and there's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly. So if you put these physiological processes to work  I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains  sugars and starches that's driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes  but through insulin resistance  you see  and not necessarily through just overeating and under exercising. When I lost my    pounds a few years ago  I did it simply by restricting those things  which admittedly suggests I have a bias based on my personal experience. But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong  and most important  all of this can be tested scientifically. But step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity  diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested. I'm betting my career on this. Today  I devote all of my time to working on this problem  and I'll go wherever the science takes me. I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don't. I've been humbled enough by all I don't know. For the past year  I've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country  and the best part is  just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals  we've done the same thing. We've recruited a team of scientific rivals  the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what's at the heart of this epidemic. Some think it's too many calories consumed. Others think it's too much dietary fat. Others think it's too many refined grains and starches. But this team of multi disciplinary  highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things. First  this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer. And two  if we're willing to be wrong  if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer  we can solve this problem. I know it's tempting to want an answer right now  some form of action or policy  some dietary prescription    eat this  not that   but if we want to get it right  we're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription. Briefly  to address this  our research program is focused around three meta themes  or questions. First  how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism  hormones and enzymes  and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms  Second  based on these insights  can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that's safe and practical to implement  And finally  once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet  how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception  Just because you know what to do doesn't mean you're always going to do it. Sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier  and believe it or not  that can be studied scientifically. I don't know how this journey is going to end  but this much seems clear to me  at least  We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did. Most of them actually want to do the right thing  but they have to know what that is  and it's got to work. I dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance  because as medical professionals  we've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals  open minds  the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas when they don't appear to be working  and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final  but constantly evolving. Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science. If obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness  what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy  Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R. seven years ago. I wish I could speak with that woman again. I'd like to tell her how sorry I am. I'd say  as a doctor  I delivered the best clinical care I could  but as a human being  I let you down. You didn't need my judgment and my contempt. You needed my empathy and compassion  and above all else  you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn't let the system down. Maybe the system  of which I was a part  was letting you down. If you're watching this now  I hope you can forgive me. I'm going to be talking about designing humor  which is sort of an interesting thing  but it goes to some of the discussions about constraints  and how in certain contexts  humor is right  and in other contexts it's wrong. Now  I'm from New York  so it's     percent satisfaction here. Actually  that's ridiculous  because when it comes to humor     percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for. Nobody is ever satisfied     percent with humor except this woman. Bob Mankoff  That's my first wife. That part of the relationship went fine. Now let's look at this cartoon. One of the things I'm pointing out is that cartoons appear within the context of The New Yorker magazine  that lovely Caslon type  and it seems like a fairly benign cartoon within this context. It's making a little bit fun of getting older  and  you know  people might like it. But like I said  you cannot satisfy everyone. You couldn't satisfy this guy.  Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit. It's nice  I'm sure to be young and rude  but some day you'll be old  unless you drop dead as I wish.  The New Yorker is rather a sensitive environment  very easy for people to get their nose out of joint. And one of the things that you realize is it's an unusual environment. Here I'm one person talking to you. You're all collective. You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh. In The New Yorker  it goes out to a wide audience  and when you actually look at that  and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at  and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor is really interesting. Let's look at this cartoon.  Discouraging data on the antidepressant.  Indeed  it is discouraging. Now  you would think  well  look  most of you laughed at that. Right  You thought it was funny. In general  that seems like a funny cartoon  but let's look what online survey I did. Generally  about    percent of the people liked it. A hundred and nine voted it a     the highest. Ten voted it one. But look at the individual responses.  I like animals       Look how much they like them.  I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me.  This person rated it a two.  I don't like to see animals suffer    even in cartoons.  To people like this  I point out we use anesthetic ink. Other people thought it was funny. That actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor when you don't have the contagion of humor. Humor is a type of entertainment. All entertainment contains a little frisson of danger  something that might happen wrong  and yet we like it when there's protection. That's what a zoo is. It's danger. The tiger is there. The bars protect us. That's sort of fun  right  That's a bad zoo. It's a very politically correct zoo  but it's a bad zoo. But this is a worse one. So in dealing with humor in the context of The New Yorker  you have to see  where is that tiger going to be  Where is the danger going to exist  How are you going to manage it  My job is to look at       cartoons a week. But The New Yorker only can take    or    cartoons  and we have       cartoons. Of course  many  many cartoons must be rejected. Now  we could fit more cartoons in the magazine if we removed the articles. But I feel that would be a huge loss  one I could live with  but still huge. Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week. The average cartoonist who stays with the magazine does    or    ideas every week. But they mostly are going to be rejected. That's the nature of any creative activity. Many of them fade away. Some of them stay. Matt Diffee is one of them. Here's one of his cartoons. Drew Dernavich.  Accounting night at the improv.   Now is the part of the show when we ask the audience to shout out some random numbers.  Paul Noth.  He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro Israel.  Now I know all about rejection  because when I quit    actually  I was booted out of    psychology school and decided to become a cartoonist  a natural segue  from      to      I submitted       cartoons to The New Yorker  and got       cartoons rejected by The New Yorker. At a certain point  this rejection slip  in          We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.    magically changed to this.  Hey  You sold one. No shit  You really sold a cartoon to the fucking New Yorker magazine.  Now of course that's not what happened  but that's the emotional truth. And of course  that is not New Yorker humor. What is New Yorker humor  Well  after       I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons. Finally  in       I received the revered New Yorker contract  which I blurred out parts because it's none of your business. From     .  Dear Mr. Mankoff  confirming the agreement there of      blah blah blah blah    blur     for any idea drawings.  With respect to idea drawings  nowhere in the contract is the word  cartoon  mentioned. The word  idea drawings   and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons. So what is an idea drawing  An idea drawing is something that requires you to think. Now that's not a cartoon. It requires thinking on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part to make it into a cartoon. Here are some  generally you get my cast of cartoon mind.  There is no justice in the world. There is some justice in the world. The world is just.  This is What Lemmings Believe. The New Yorker and I  when we made comments  the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is. What is it  the cartoon  Is it really about lemmings  No. It's about us. You know  it's my view basically about religion  that the real conflict and all the fights between religion is who has the best imaginary friend. And this is my most well known cartoon.  No  Thursday's out. How about never   is never good for you   It's been reprinted thousands of times  totally ripped off. It's even on thongs  but compressed to  How about never   is never good for you   Now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great similarity. In each instance  our expectations are defied. In each instance  the narrative gets switched. There's an incongruity and a contrast. In  No  Thursday's out. How about never   is never good for you   what you have is the syntax of politeness and the message of being rude. That really is how humor works. It's a cognitive synergy where we mash up these two things which don't go together and temporarily in our minds exist. He is both being polite and rude. In here  you have the propriety of The New Yorker and the vulgarity of the language. Basically  that's the way humor works. So I'm a humor analyst  you would say. Now E.B. White said  analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog. Nobody is much interested  and the frog dies. Well  I'm going to kill a few  but there won't be any genocide. But really  it makes me   Let's look at this picture. This is an interesting picture  The Laughing Audience. There are the people  fops up there  but everybody is laughing  everybody is laughing except one guy. This guy. Who is he  He's the critic. He's the critic of humor  and really I'm forced to be in that position  when I'm at The New Yorker  and that's the danger that I will become this guy. Now here's a little video made by Matt Diffee  sort of how they imagine if we really exaggerated that. Ehhh. Oooh. Hmm. Too funny. Normally I would but I'm in a pissy mood. I'll enjoy it on my own. Perhaps. No. Nah. No. Overdrawn. Underdrawn. Drawn just right  still not funny enough. No. No. For God's sake no  a thousand times no. No. No. No. No. No.  Four hours later  Hey  that's good  yeah  whatcha got there  Office worker  Got a ham and swiss on rye BM  No. Office worker  Okay. Pastrami on sourdough BM  No. Office worker  Smoked turkey with bacon BM  No. Office worker  Falafel BM  Let me look at it. Eh  no. Office worker  Grilled cheese BM  No. Office worker  BLT BM  No. Office worker  Black forest ham and mozzarella with apple mustard BM  No. Office worker  Green bean salad BM  No. No. No. Definitely no.  Several hours after lunch  No. Get out of here. That's sort of an exaggeration of what I do. Now  we do reject  many  many  many cartoons  so many that there are many books called  The Rejection Collection.   The Rejection Collection  is not quite New Yorker kind of humor. And you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking. See  that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor. It's actually put together by Matt Diffee  one of our cartoonists. So I'll give you some examples of rejection collection humor.  I'm thinking about having a child.  There you have an interesting    the guilty laugh  the laugh against your better judgment.  Ass head. Please help.  Now  in fact  within a context of this book  which says   Cartoons you never saw and never will see in The New Yorker   this humor is perfect. I'm going to explain why. There's a concept about humor about it being a benign violation. In other words  for something to be funny  we've got to think it's both wrong and also okay at the same time. If we think it's completely wrong  we say   That's not funny.  And if it's completely okay  what's the joke  Okay  And so  this benign  that's true of  No  Thursday's out. How about never   is never good for you   It's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way. Within that context  we feel it's okay. So within this context   Asshead. Please help  is a benign violation. Within the context of The New Yorker magazine ...  T Cell Army  Can the body's immune response help treat cancer   Oh  goodness. You're reading about this smart stuff  this intelligent dissection of the immune system. You glance over at this  and it says   Asshead. Please help   God. So there the violation is malign. It doesn't work. There is no such thing as funny in and of itself. Everything will be within the context and our expectations. One way to look at it is this. It's sort of called a meta motivational theory about how we look  a theory about motivation and the mood we're in and how the mood we're in determines the things we like or dislike. When we're in a playful mood  we want excitement. We want high arousal. We feel excited then. If we're in a purposeful mood  that makes us anxious.  The Rejection Collection  is absolutely in this field. You want to be stimulated. You want to be aroused. You want to be transgressed. It's like this  like an amusement park. Voice  Here we go.  Screams  He laughs. He is both in danger and safe  incredibly aroused. There's no joke. No joke needed. If you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough  they will laugh at very  very little. This is another cartoon from  The Rejection Collection.   Too snug   That's a cartoon about terrorism. The New Yorker occupies a very different space. It's a space that is playful in its own way  and also purposeful  and in that space  the cartoons are different. Now I'm going to show you cartoons The New Yorker did right after       a very  very sensitive area when humor could be used. How would The New Yorker attack it  It would not be with a guy with a bomb saying   Too snug   Or there was another cartoon I didn't show because actually I thought maybe people would be offended. The great Sam Gross cartoon  this happened after the Muhammad controversy where it's Muhammad in heaven  the suicide bomber is all in little pieces  and he's saying to the suicide bomber   You'll get the virgins when we find your penis.  Better left undrawn. The first week we did no cartoons. That was a black hole for humor  and correctly so. It's not always appropriate every time. But the next week  this was the first cartoon.  I thought I'd never laugh again. Then I saw your jacket.  It basically was about  if we were alive  we were going to laugh. We were going to breathe. We were going to exist. Here's another one.  I figure if I don't have that third martini  then the terrorists win.  These cartoons are not about them. They're about us. The humor reflects back on us. The easiest thing to do with humor  and it's perfectly legitimate  is a friend makes fun of an enemy. It's called dispositional humor. It's    percent of the humor. It's not our humor. Here's another cartoon.  I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state.  Humor does need a target. But interestingly  in The New Yorker  the target is us. The target is the readership and the people who do it. The humor is self reflective and makes us think about our assumptions. Look at this cartoon by Roz Chast  the guy reading the obituary.  Two years younger than you     years older than you  three years your junior  your age on the dot  exactly your age.  That is a deeply profound cartoon. And so The New Yorker is also trying to  in some way  make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us. Here's another one.  I started my vegetarianism for health reasons  Then it became a moral choice  and now it's just to annoy people.   Excuse me   I think there's something wrong with this in a tiny way that no one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint.  So it focuses on our obsessions  our narcissism  our foils and our foibles  really not someone else's. The New Yorker demands some cognitive work on your part  and what it demands is what Arthur Koestler  who wrote  The Act of Creation  about the relationship between humor  art and science  is what's called bisociation. You have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference  and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon. If the different frames of reference don't come together in about .  seconds  it's not funny  but I think they will for you here. Different frames of reference.  You slept with her  didn't you    Lassie  Get help    It's called French Army Knife. And this is Einstein in bed.  To you it was fast.  Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling. Like  this cartoon would puzzle many people. How many people know what this cartoon means  The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk. This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog. That's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year called  I Don't Get It  The New Yorker Cartoon I.Q. Test.  The other thing The New Yorker plays around with is incongruity  and incongruity  I've shown you  is sort of the basis of humor. Something that's completely normal or logical isn't going to be funny. But the way incongruity works is  observational humor is humor within the realm of reality.  My boss is always telling me what to do.  Okay  That could happen. It's humor within the realm of reality. Here  cowboy to a cow   Very impressive. I'd like to find       more like you.  We understand that. It's absurd. But we're putting the two together. Here  in the nonsense range   Damn it  Hopkins  didn't you get yesterday's memo   Now that's a little puzzling  right  It doesn't quite come together. In general  people who enjoy more nonsense  enjoy more abstract art  they tend to be liberal  less conservative  that type of stuff. But for us  and for me  helping design the humor  it doesn't make any sense to compare one to the other. It's sort of a smorgasbord that's made all interesting. So I want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon  and I think this sums up the whole thing  really  about The New Yorker cartoons.  It sort of makes you stop and think  doesn't it.  And now  when you look at New Yorker cartoons  I'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about them. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  I do want to test this question we're all interested in  Does extinction have to be forever  I'm focused on two projects I want to tell you about. One is the Thylacine Project. The other one is the Lazarus Project  and that's focused on the gastric brooding frog. And it would be a fair question to ask  why have we focused on these two animals  Well  point number one  each of them represents a unique family of its own. We've lost a whole family. That's a big chunk of the global genome gone. I'd like it back. The second reason is that we killed these things. In the case of the thylacine  regrettably  we shot every one that we saw. We slaughtered them. In the case of the gastric brooding frog  we may have  fungicided  it to death. There's a dreadful fungus that's moving through the world that's called the chytrid fungus  and it's nailing frogs all over the world. We think that's probably what got this frog  and humans are spreading this fungus. And this introduces a very important ethical point  and I think you will have heard this many times when this topic comes up. What I think is important is that  if it's clear that we exterminated these species  then I think we not only have a moral obligation to see what we can do about it  but I think we've got a moral imperative to try to do something  if we can. OK. Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project. It's a frog. And you think  frog. Yeah  but this was not just any frog. Unlike a normal frog  which lays its eggs in the water and goes away and wishes its froglets well  this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs  swallowed them into the stomach  where it should be having food  didn't digest the eggs  and turned its stomach into a uterus. In the stomach  the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles  and in the stomach  the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs  and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart. It has a little cough and a hiccup  and out comes sprays of little frogs. Now  when biologists saw this  they were agog. They thought  this is incredible. No animal  let alone a frog  has been known to do this  to change one organ in the body into another. And you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well. If we could understand how that frog is managing the way its tummy works  is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use to help ourselves  Now  I'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach  but I am suggesting it's possible we might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut. And just as everybody got excited about it  bang  It was extinct. I called up my friend  Professor Mike Tyler in the University of Adelaide. He was the last person who had this frog  a colony of these things  in his lab. And I said   Mike  by any chance     This was    or    years ago.  By any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog   And he thought about it  and he went to his deep freezer  minus    degrees centigrade  and he poured through everything in the freezer  and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs. This was very exciting  but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work  because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it  cryoprotectants  to look after it when it was frozen. And normally  when water freezes  as you know  it expands  and the same thing happens in a cell. If you freeze tissues  the water expands  damages or bursts the cell walls. Well  we looked at the tissue under the microscope. It actually didn't look bad. The cell walls looked intact. So we thought  let's give it a go. What we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation. We took the eggs of a related species  a living frog  and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg. We used ultraviolet radiation to do that. And then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei into that egg. Now  by rights  this is kind of like a cloning project  like what produced Dolly  but it's actually very different  because Dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells. That was a miracle  but it was workable. What we're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species and put it into a completely different species and expect that to work. Well  we had no real reason to expect it would  and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these. And just last February  the last time we did these trials  I saw a miracle starting to happen. What we found was most of these eggs didn't work  but then suddenly  one of them began to divide. That was so exciting. And then the egg divided again. And then again. And pretty soon  we had early stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those. We even DNA tested some of these cells  and the DNA of the extinct frog is in those cells. So we're very excited. This is not a tadpole. It's not a frog. But it's a long way along the journey to producing  or bringing back  an extinct species. And this is news. We haven't announced this publicly before. We're excited. We've got to get past this point. We now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate  to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues. It'll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog. Watch this space. I think we're going to have this frog hopping glad to be back in the world again. Thank you. We haven't done it yet  but keep the applause ready. The second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project. The thylacine looks a bit  to most people  like a dog  or maybe like a tiger  because it has stripes. But it's not related to any of those. It's a marsupial. It raised its young in a pouch  like a koala or a kangaroo would do  and it has a long history  a long  fascinating history  that goes back    million years. But it's also a tragic history. The first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia about    million years ago  and the National Geographic Society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits. This is Riversleigh. In those fossil rocks are some amazing animals. We found marsupial lions. We found carnivorous kangaroos. It's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo  but these are meat eating kangaroos. We found the biggest bird in the world  bigger than that thing that was in Madagascar  and it too was a flesh eater. It was a giant  weird duck. And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either. You think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing  sitting in a pool of water. These crocodiles were actually out on the land and they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey on the ground. We had  in Australia  drop crocs. They really do exist. But what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals but also thylacines. There were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests  and they ranged from great big ones to middle sized ones to one that was about the size of a chihuahua. Paris Hilton would have been able to carry one of these things around in a little handbag  until a drop croc landed on her. At any rate  it was a fascinating place  but unfortunately  Australia didn't stay this way. Climate change has affected the world for a long period of time  and gradually  the forests disappeared  the country began to dry out  and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline  until by five million years ago  only one left. By        years ago  they had disappeared from New Guinea  and unfortunately  by       years ago  somebodies  we don't know who this was  introduced dingoes    this is a very archaic kind of a dog    into Australia. And as you can see  dingoes are very similar in their body form to thylacines. That similarity meant they probably competed. They were eating the same kinds of foods. It's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes as pets  and therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival. All we know is  soon after the dingoes were brought in  thylacines were extinct in the Australian mainland  and after that they only survived in Tasmania. Then  unfortunately  the next sad part of the thylacine story is that Europeans arrived in       and they brought with them the things they valued  and that included sheep. They took one look at the thylacine in Tasmania  and they thought  hang on  this is not going to work. That guy is going to eat all our sheep. That was not what happened  actually. Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep  but the thylacine got a bad rap. But immediately  the government said  that's it  let's get rid of them  and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw. By the early     s        to       thylacines had been murdered. It was a disaster  and they were about to hit the wall. Have a look at this bit of film footage. It makes me very sad because  while it's a fascinating animal  and it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction  we didn't  unfortunately  at this same time  have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species. These are photos of the last surviving thylacine  Benjamin  who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart. To add insult to injury  having swept this species nearly off the table  this animal  when it died of neglect    The keepers didn't let it into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart. It died of exposure  and in the morning  when they found the body of Benjamin  they still cared so little for this animal that they threw the body in the dump. Does it have to stay this way  In       I was in the Australian Museum. I was fascinated by thylacines. I've always been obsessed with these animals. And I was studying skulls  trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals  and I saw this jar  and here  in the jar  was a little girl thylacine pup  perhaps six months old. The guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup  and they pickled it in alcohol. I'm a paleontologist  but I still knew alcohol was a DNA preservative. But this was       and I asked my geneticist friends  couldn't we think about going into this pup and extracting DNA  if it's there  and then somewhere down the line in the future  we'll use this DNA to bring the thylacine back  The geneticists laughed. But this was six years before Dolly. Cloning was science fiction. It had not happened. But then suddenly cloning did happen. And I thought  when I became director of the Australian Museum  I'm going to give this a go. I put a team together. We went into that pup to see what was in it  and we did find thylacine DNA. It was a eureka moment. We were very excited. Unfortunately  we also found a lot of human DNA. Every old curator who'd been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen  put their hand in the jar  pulled it out and thought   Wow  look at that   plop  dropped it back in the jar  contaminating this specimen. And that was a worry. If the goal here was to get the DNA out and use the DNA down the track to try to bring a thylacine back  what we didn't want happening when the information was shoved into the machine and the wheel turned around and the lights flashed  was to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine. It would've kept the curator very happy  but it wasn't going to keep us happy. So we went back to these specimens and we started digging around  and particularly  we looked into the teeth of skulls  hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers  and we found much better quality DNA. We found nuclear mitochondrial genes. It's there. So we got it. OK. What could we do with this stuff  Well  George Church  in his book   Regenesis   has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented DNA. We would hope that we'll be able to get that DNA back into a viable form  and then  much like we've done with the Lazarus Project  get that stuff into an egg of a host species. It has to be a different species. What could it be  Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil  They're related  distantly  to thylacines. And then the Tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end. Critics of this project say  hang on. Thylacine  Tasmanian devil  That's going to hurt. No  it's not. These are marsupials. They give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean. That Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth. It is  shortly  going to think it's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world  so maybe it'll need some help to keep it going. Andrew Pask and his colleagues have demonstrated this might not be a waste of time. And it's sort of in the future  we haven't got there yet  but it's the kind of thing we want to think about. They took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA and they spliced it into a mouse genome  but they put a tag on it so that anything that this thylacine DNA produced would appear blue green in the mouse baby. In other words  if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA  it would be able to be recognized. When the baby popped up  it was filled with blue green tissues. And that tells us if we can get that genome back together  get it into a live cell  it's going to produce thylacine stuff. Is this a risk  You've taken the bits of one animal and you've mixed them into the cell of a different kind of an animal. Are we going to get a Frankenstein  Some kind of weird hybrid chimera  And the answer is no. If the only nuclear DNA that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA  that's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil. OK  if we can do this  could we put it back  This is a key question for everybody. Does it have to stay in a laboratory  or could we put it back where it belongs  Could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in Tasmania  restore that ecosystem  Or has Tasmania changed so much that that's no longer possible  I've been to Tasmania. I've been to many of the areas where the thylacines were common. I've even spoken to people  like Peter Carter here  who when I spoke to him  was    years old  but in       this man and his father and his brother caught thylacines. They trapped them. And when I spoke to this man  I was looking in his eyes and thinking   Behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like  what they smelled like  what they sounded like.  He led them around on a rope. He has personal experiences that I would give my left leg to have in my head. We'd all love to have this sort of thing happen. Anyway  I asked Peter  by any chance  could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines. My interest was in whether the environment had changed. He thought hard. It was nearly    years before this that he'd been at this hut. At any rate  he led us down this bush track  and there  right where he remembered  was the hut  and tears came into his eyes. He looked at the hut. We went inside. There were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut where he and his father and his brother had slept at night. And he told me  as it all was flooding back in memories. He said   I remember the thylacines going around the hut wondering what was inside   and he said they made sounds like  Yip  Yip  Yip   All of these are parts of his life and what he remembers. And the key question for me was to ask Peter  has it changed  And he said no. The southern beech forests surrounded his hut just like it was when he was there in     . The grasslands were sweeping away. That's classic thylacine habitat. And the animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around. So could we put it back  Yes. Is that all we would do  And this is an interesting question. Sometimes you might be able to put it back  but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again  And I don't think so. I think gradually  as we see species all around the world  it's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild. We'd love to think it is  but we know it isn't. We need other parallel strategies coming online. And this one interests me. Some of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos  sanctuaries  even at the museums  had collar marks on the neck. They were being kept as pets  and we know a lot of bush tales and memories of people who had them as pets  and they say they were wonderful  friendly. This particular one came in out of the forest to lick this boy and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep. A wild animal. And I'd like to ask the question. We need to think about this. If it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then  would the thylacine be extinct now  And I'm positive it wouldn't. We need to think about this in today's world. Could it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them  maybe they won't go extinct  And this is such a critical issue for us because if we don't do that  we're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice. As far as I'm concerned  this is why we're trying to do these kinds of de extinction projects. We are trying to restore that balance of nature that we have upset. Thank you. Well  Arthur C. Clarke  a famous science fiction writer from the     s  said that   We overestimate technology in the short term  and we underestimate it in the long term.  And I think that's some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots. That we're overestimating the technology in the short term. But I am worried whether we're going to get the technology we need in the long term. Because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing and that we  our society  is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future. So I'm scared we won't have enough robots. But fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time. Back in       there was a Spencer Tracy  Katharine Hepburn movie. So you know how it ended up  Spencer Tracy brought a computer  a mainframe computer of       in to help the librarians. The librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives   What are the names of Santa's reindeer   And they would look that up. And this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job. Well of course a mainframe computer in      wasn't much use for that job. The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear. But that's not what happened in fact. The number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after     . It wasn't until the Internet came into play  the web came into play and search engines came into play that the need for librarians went down. And I think everyone from      totally underestimated the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today. And we can just ask   What are the names of Santa's reindeer   and be told instantly    or anything else we want to ask. By the way  the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the U.S. over that same time period  because librarians became partners of computers. Computers became tools  and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time. Same thing happened in offices. Back in the old days  people used spreadsheets. Spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper  and they calculated by hand. But here was an interesting thing that came along. With the revolution around      of P.C.'s  the spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers  not to replace office workers  but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers. So office workers became programmers of spreadsheets. It increased their capabilities. They no longer had to do the mundane computations  but they could do something much more. Now today  we're starting to see robots in our lives. On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot. When soldiers came across roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan  instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick  as they used to do up until about       they now send the robot out. So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs. On the right are some TUGs from a company called Aethon in Pittsburgh. These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S. And they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry. They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen. They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy. And it frees up the nurses and the nurse's aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients. In fact  robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways. But I think when it comes to factory robots  people are sort of afraid  because factory robots are dangerous to be around. In order to program them  you have to understand six dimensional vectors and quaternions. And ordinary people can't interact with them. And I think it's the sort of technology that's gone wrong. It's displaced the worker from the technology. And I think we really have to look at technologies that ordinary workers can interact with. And so I want to tell you today about Baxter  which we've been talking about. And Baxter  I see  as a way    a first wave of robot that ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting. So Baxter is up here. This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics. We've got a conveyor there. And if the lighting isn't too extreme    Ah  ah  There it is. It's picked up the object off the conveyor. It's going to come bring it over here and put it down. And then it'll go back  reach for another object. The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense. By the way  what's going on with the eyes  The eyes are on the screen there. The eyes look ahead where the robot's going to move. So a person that's interacting with the robot understands where it's going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions. Here Chris took the object out of its hand  and Baxter didn't go and try to put it down  it went back and realized it had to get another one. It's got a little bit of basic common sense  goes and picks the objects. And Baxter's safe to interact with. You wouldn't want to do this with a current industrial robot. But with Baxter it doesn't hurt. It feels the force  understands that Chris is there and doesn't push through him and hurt him. But I think the most interesting thing about Baxter is the user interface. And so Chris is going to come and grab the other arm now. And when he grabs an arm  it goes into zero force gravity compensated mode and graphics come up on the screen. You can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm. He's going to put something in its hand  he's going to bring it over here  press a button and let go of that thing in the hand. And the robot figures out  ah  he must mean I want to put stuff down. It puts a little icon there. He comes over here  and he gets the fingers to grasp together  and the robot infers  ah  you want an object for me to pick up. That puts the green icon there. He's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from. It just moves it around  and the robot figures out that was an area search. He didn't have to select that from a menu. And now he's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object while we continue talking. So as we continue here  I want to tell you about what this is like in factories. These robots we're shipping every day. They go to factories around the country. This is Mildred. Mildred's a factory worker in Connecticut. She's worked on the line for over    years. One hour after she saw her first industrial robot  she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory. She decided she really liked robots. And it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand. Now she's got the robot doing it. When we first went out to talk to people in factories about how we could get robots to interact with them better  one of the questions we asked them was   Do you want your children to work in a factory   The universal answer was  No  I want a better job than that for my children.  And as a result of that  Mildred is very typical of today's factory workers in the U.S. They're older  and they're getting older and older. There aren't many young people coming into factory work. And as their tasks become more onerous on them  we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with  so that they can be part of the solution  so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the U.S. And so our vision is that Mildred who's the line worker becomes Mildred the robot trainer. She lifts her game  like the office workers of the     s lifted their game of what they could do. We're not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use. They're tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes. There's two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable. That's climate change and demographics. Demographics is really going to change our world. This is the percentage of adults who are working age. And it's gone down slightly over the last    years. But over the next    years  it's going to change dramatically  even in China. The percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically. And turned up the other way  the people who are retirement age goes up very  very fast  as the baby boomers get to retirement age. That means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars competing for services. But more than that  as we get older we get more frail and we can't do all the tasks we used to do. If we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers  before our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older. That's happening statistically right now. And as the number of people who are older  above retirement age and getting older  as they increase  there will be less people to take care of them. And I think we're really going to have to have robots to help us. And I don't mean robots in terms of companions. I mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older. Getting the groceries in from the car  up the stairs  into the kitchen. Or even  as we get very much older  driving our cars to go visit people. And I think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control of the robotic solution. So they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them. And so I really think that we're going to be spending more time with robots like Baxter and working with robots like Baxter in our daily lives. And that we will    Here  Baxter  it's good. And that we will all come to rely on robots over the next    years as part of our everyday lives. Thanks very much. Good morning. My name is Eric Li  and I was born here. But no  I wasn't born there. This was where I was born  Shanghai  at the height of the Cultural Revolution. My grandmother tells me that she heard the sound of gunfire along with my first cries. When I was growing up  I was told a story that explained all I ever needed to know about humanity. It went like this. All human societies develop in linear progression  beginning with primitive society  then slave society  feudalism  capitalism  socialism  and finally  guess where we end up  Communism  Sooner or later  all of humanity  regardless of culture  language  nationality  will arrive at this final stage of political and social development. The entire world's peoples will be unified in this paradise on Earth and live happily ever after. But before we get there  we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil  the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism  and the good shall triumph. That  of course  was the meta narrative distilled from the theories of Karl Marx. And the Chinese bought it. We were taught that grand story day in and day out. It became part of us  and we believed in it. The story was a bestseller. About one third of the entire world's population lived under that meta narrative. Then  the world changed overnight. As for me  disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth  I went to America and became a Berkeley hippie. Now  as I was coming of age  something else happened. As if one big story wasn't enough  I was told another one. This one was just as grand. It also claims that all human societies develop in a linear progression towards a singular end. This one went as follows  All societies  regardless of culture  be it Christian  Muslim  Confucian  must progress from traditional societies in which groups are the basic units to modern societies in which atomized individuals are the sovereign units  and all these individuals are  by definition  rational  and they all want one thing  the vote. Because they are all rational  once given the vote  they produce good government and live happily ever after. Paradise on Earth  again. Sooner or later  electoral democracy will be the only political system for all countries and all peoples  with a free market to make them all rich. But before we get there  we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil. The good belongs to those who are democracies and are charged with a mission of spreading it around the globe  sometimes by force  against the evil of those who do not hold elections. who would hold power. Eric X. Li  Now    This story also became a bestseller. According to Freedom House  the number of democracies went from    in      to     in     . In the last    years  Western elites tirelessly trotted around the globe selling this prospectus  Multiple parties fight for political power and everyone voting on them is the only path to salvation to the long suffering developing world. Those who buy the prospectus are destined for success. Those who do not are doomed to fail. But this time  the Chinese didn't buy it. Fool me once... The rest is history. In just    years  China went from one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world to its second largest economy. Six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty. Eighty percent of the entire world's poverty alleviation during that period happened in China. In other words  all the new and old democracies put together amounted to a mere fraction of what a single  one party state did without voting. See  I grew up on this stuff  food stamps. Meat was rationed to a few hundred grams per person per month at one point. Needless to say  I ate all my grandmother's portions. So I asked myself  what's wrong with this picture  Here I am in my hometown  my business growing leaps and bounds. Entrepreneurs are starting companies every day. Middle class is expanding in speed and scale unprecedented in human history. Yet  according to the grand story  none of this should be happening. So I went and did the only thing I could. I studied it. Yes  China is a one party state run by the Chinese Communist Party  the Party  and they don't hold elections. Three assumptions are made by the dominant political theories of our time. Such a system is operationally rigid  politically closed  and morally illegitimate. Well  the assumptions are wrong. The opposites are true. Adaptability  meritocracy  and legitimacy are the three defining characteristics of China's one party system. Now  most political scientists will tell us that a one party system is inherently incapable of self correction. It won't last long because it cannot adapt. Now here are the facts. In    years of running the largest country in the world  the range of the Party's policies has been wider than any other country in recent memory  from radical land collectivization to the Great Leap Forward  then privatization of farmland  then the Cultural Revolution  then Deng Xiaoping's market reform  then successor Jiang Zemin took the giant political step of opening up Party membership to private businesspeople  something unimaginable during Mao's rule. So the Party self corrects in rather dramatic fashions. Institutionally  new rules get enacted to correct previous dysfunctions. For example  term limits. Political leaders used to retain their positions for life  and they used that to accumulate power and perpetuate their rules. Mao was the father of modern China  yet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes. So the Party instituted term limits with mandatory retirement age of    to   . One thing we often hear is   Political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms   and  China is in dire need of political reform.  But this claim is a rhetorical trap hidden behind a political bias. See  some have decided a priori what kinds of changes they want to see  and only such changes can be called political reform. The truth is  political reforms have never stopped. Compared with    years ago     years  even    years ago  every aspect of Chinese society  how the country is governed  from the most local level to the highest center  are unrecognizable today. Now such changes are simply not possible without political reforms of the most fundamental kind. Now I would venture to suggest the Party is the world's leading expert in political reform. The second assumption is that in a one party state  power gets concentrated in the hands of the few  and bad governance and corruption follow. Indeed  corruption is a big problem  but let's first look at the larger context. Now  this may be counterintuitive to you. The Party happens to be one of the most meritocratic political institutions in the world today. China's highest ruling body  the Politburo  has    members. In the most recent one  only five of them came from a background of privilege  so called princelings. The other     including the president and the premier  came from entirely ordinary backgrounds. In the larger central committee of     or more  the percentage of those who were born into power and wealth was even smaller. The vast majority of senior Chinese leaders worked and competed their way to the top. Compare that with the ruling elites in both developed and developing countries  I think you'll find the Party being near the top in upward mobility. The question then is  how could that be possible in a system run by one party  Now we come to a powerful political institution  little known to Westerners  the Party's Organization Department. The department functions like a giant human resource engine that would be the envy of even some of the most successful corporations. It operates a rotating pyramid made up of three components  civil service  state owned enterprises  and social organizations like a university or a community program. They form separate yet integrated career paths for Chinese officials. They recruit college grads into entry level positions in all three tracks  and they start from the bottom  called  keyuan   clerk . Then they could get promoted through four increasingly elite ranks  fuke  deputy section manager   ke  section manager   fuchu  deputy division manager   and chu  division manger . Now these are not moves from  Karate Kid   okay  It's serious business. The range of positions is wide  from running health care in a village to foreign investment in a city district to manager in a company. Once a year  the department reviews their performance. They interview their superiors  their peers  their subordinates. They vet their personal conduct. They conduct public opinion surveys. Then they promote the winners. Throughout their careers  these cadres can move through and out of all three tracks. Over time  the good ones move beyond the four base levels to the fuju  deputy bureau chief  and ju  bureau chief  levels. There  they enter high officialdom. By that point  a typical assignment will be to manage a district with a population in the millions or a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Just to show you how competitive the system is  in       there were         fuke and ke levels          fuchu and chu levels  and only        fuju and ju levels. After the ju levels  the best few move further up several more ranks  and eventually make it to the Central Committee. The process takes two to three decades. Does patronage play a role  Yes  of course. But merit remains the fundamental driver. In essence  the Organization Department runs a modernized version of China's centuries old mentoring system. China's new president  Xi Jinping  is the son of a former leader  which is very unusual  first of his kind to make the top job. Even for him  the career took    years. He started as a village manager  and by the time he entered the Politburo  he had managed areas with a total population of     million people and combined GDPs of  .  trillion U.S. dollars. Now  please don't get me wrong  okay  This is not a put down of anyone. It's just a statement of fact. George W. Bush  remember him  This is not a put down. Before becoming governor of Texas  or Barack Obama before running for president  could not make even a small county manager in China's system. Winston Churchill once said that democracy is a terrible system except for all the rest. Well  apparently he hadn't heard of the Organization Department. Now  Westerners always assume that multi party election with universal suffrage is the only source of political legitimacy. I was asked once   The Party wasn't voted in by election. Where is the source of legitimacy   I said   How about competency   We all know the facts. In       when the Party took power  China was mired in civil wars  dismembered by foreign aggression  average life expectancy at that time     years old. Today  it's the second largest economy in the world  an industrial powerhouse  and its people live in increasing prosperity. Pew Research polls Chinese public attitudes  and here are the numbers in recent years. Satisfaction with the direction of the country     percent. Those who think they're better off than five years ago     percent. Those who expect the future to be better  a whopping    percent. Financial Times polls global youth attitudes  and these numbers  brand new  just came from last week. Ninety three percent of China's Generation Y are optimistic about their country's future. Now  if this is not legitimacy  I'm not sure what is. In contrast  most electoral democracies around the world are suffering from dismal performance. I don't need to elaborate for this audience how dysfunctional it is  from Washington to European capitals. With a few exceptions  the vast number of developing countries that have adopted electoral regimes are still suffering from poverty and civil strife. Governments get elected  and then they fall below    percent approval in a few months and stay there and get worse until the next election. Democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle of elect and regret. At this rate  I'm afraid it is democracy  not China's one party system  that is in danger of losing legitimacy. Now  I don't want to create the misimpression that China's hunky dory  on the way to some kind of superpowerdom. The country faces enormous challenges. The social and economic problems that come with wrenching change like this are mind boggling. Pollution is one. Food safety. Population issues. On the political front  the worst problem is corruption. Corruption is widespread and undermines the system and its moral legitimacy. But most analysts misdiagnose the disease. They say that corruption is the result of the one party system  and therefore  in order to cure it  you have to do away with the entire system. But a more careful look would tell us otherwise. Transparency International ranks China between    and    in recent years among     countries  and it's been moving up. India  the largest democracy in the world     and dropping. For the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China  more than half of them are electoral democracies. So if election is the panacea for corruption  how come these countries can't fix it  Now  I'm a venture capitalist. I make bets. It wouldn't be fair to end this talk without putting myself on the line and making some predictions. So here they are. In the next    years  China will surpass the U.S. and become the largest economy in the world. Income per capita will be near the top of all developing countries. Corruption will be curbed  but not eliminated  and China will move up    to    notches to above    in T.I. ranking. Economic reform will accelerate  political reform will continue  and the one party system will hold firm. We live in the dusk of an era. Meta narratives that make universal claims failed us in the   th century and are failing us in the   st. Meta narrative is the cancer that is killing democracy from the inside. Now  I want to clarify something. I'm not here to make an indictment of democracy. On the contrary  I think democracy contributed to the rise of the West and the creation of the modern world. It is the universal claim that many Western elites are making about their political system  the hubris  that is at the heart of the West's current ills. If they would spend just a little less time on trying to force their way onto others  and a little bit more on political reform at home  they might give their democracy a better chance. China's political model will never supplant electoral democracy  because unlike the latter  it doesn't pretend to be universal. It cannot be exported. But that is the point precisely. The significance of China's example is not that it provides an alternative  but the demonstration that alternatives exist. Let us draw to a close this era of meta narratives. Communism and democracy may both be laudable ideals  but the era of their dogmatic universalism is over. Let us stop telling people and our children there's only one way to govern ourselves and a singular future towards which all societies must evolve. It is wrong. It is irresponsible. And worst of all  it is boring. Let universality make way for plurality. Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us. Are we brave enough to welcome it  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Bruno Giussani  Eric  stay with me for a couple of minutes  because I want to ask you a couple of questions. I think many here  and in general in Western countries  would agree with your statement about analysis of democratic systems becoming dysfunctional  but at the same time  many would kind of find unsettling the thought that there is an unelected authority that  without any form of oversight or consultation  decides what the national interest is. What is the mechanism in the Chinese model that allows people to say  actually  the national interest as you defined it is wrong  EXL  You know  Frank Fukuyama  the political scientist  called the Chinese system  responsive authoritarianism.  It's not exactly right  but I think it comes close. So I know the largest public opinion survey company in China  okay  Do you know who their biggest client is  The Chinese government. Not just from the central government  the city government  the provincial government  to the most local neighborhood districts. They conduct surveys all the time. Are you happy with the garbage collection  Are you happy with the general direction of the country  So there is  in China  there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people. My point is  I think we should get unstuck from the thinking that there's only one political system    election  election  election    that could make it responsive. I'm not sure  actually  elections produce responsive government anymore in the world. BG  Many seem to agree. One of the features of a democratic system is a space for civil society to express itself. And you have shown figures about the support that the government and the authorities have in China. But then you've just mentioned other elements like  you know  big challenges  and there are  of course  a lot of other data that go in a different direction  tens of thousands of unrests and protests and environmental protests  etc. So you seem to suggest the Chinese model doesn't have a space outside of the Party for civil society to express itself. EXL  There's a vibrant civil society in China  whether it's environment or what have you. But it's different. You wouldn't recognize it. Because  by Western definitions  a so called civil society has to be separate or even in opposition to the political system  but that concept is alien for Chinese culture. For thousands of years  you have civil society  yet they are consistent and coherent and part of a political order  and I think it's a big cultural difference. BG  Eric  thank you for sharing this with TED. EXL  Thank you. There's an old joke about a cop who's walking his beat in the middle of the night  and he comes across a guy under a street lamp who's looking at the ground and moving from side to side  and the cop asks him what he's doing. The guys says he's looking for his keys. So the cop takes his time and looks over and kind of makes a little matrix and looks for about two  three minutes. No keys. The cop says   Are you sure  Hey buddy  are you sure you lost your keys here   And the guy says   No  actually I lost them down at the other end of the street  but the light is better here.  There's a concept that people talk about nowadays called  big data.  And what they're talking about is all of the information that we're generating through our interaction with and over the Internet  everything from Facebook and Twitter to music downloads  movies  streaming  all this kind of stuff  the live streaming of TED. And the folks who work with big data  for them  they talk about that their biggest problem is we have so much information. The biggest problem is  how do we organize all that information  I can tell you that  working in global health  that is not our biggest problem. Because for us  even though the light is better on the Internet  the data that would help us solve the problems we're trying to solve is not actually present on the Internet. So we don't know  for example  how many people right now are being affected by disasters or by conflict situations. We don't know for  really  basically  any of the clinics in the developing world  which ones have medicines and which ones don't. We have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics. We don't know    and this is really amazing to me    we don't know how many children were born    or how many children there are    in Bolivia or Botswana or Bhutan. We don't know how many kids died last week in any of those countries. We don't know the needs of the elderly  the mentally ill. For all of these different critically important problems or critically important areas that we want to solve problems in  we basically know nothing at all. And part of the reason why we don't know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems is what you see here. This is about a       year old technology. Some of you may have used it before. It's kind of on its way out now  but we still use it for    percent of our stuff. This is a paper form. And what you're looking at is a paper form in the hand of a Ministry of Health nurse in Indonesia  who is tramping out across the countryside in Indonesia on  I'm sure  a very hot and humid day  and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months  knocking on the doors and saying   Excuse me  we'd like to ask you some questions. Do you have any children  Were your children vaccinated   Because the only way we can actually find out how many children were vaccinated in the country of Indonesia  what percentage were vaccinated  is actually not on the Internet  but by going out and knocking on doors  sometimes tens of thousands of doors. Sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this. You know  a census of Indonesia would probably take two years to accomplish. And the problem  of course  with all of this is that  with all those paper forms    and I'm telling you  we have paper forms for every possible thing  We have paper forms for vaccination surveys. We have paper forms to track people who come into clinics. We have paper forms to track drug supplies  blood supplies    all these different paper forms for many different topics  they all have a single  common endpoint  and the common endpoint looks something like this. And what we're looking at here is a truckful of data. This is the data from a single vaccination coverage survey in a single district in the country of Zambia from a few years ago  that I participated in. The only thing anyone was trying to find out is what percentage of Zambian children are vaccinated  and this is the data  collected on paper over weeks  from a single district  which is something like a county in the United States. You can imagine that  for the entire country of Zambia  answering just that single question ... looks something like this. Truck after truck after truck  filled with stack after stack after stack of data. And what makes it even worse is that's just the beginning. Because once you've collected all that data  of course  someone    some unfortunate person    is going to have to type that into a computer. When I was a graduate student  I actually was that unfortunate person sometimes. I can tell you  I often wasn't really paying attention. I probably made a lot of mistakes when I did it that no one ever discovered  so data quality goes down. But eventually that data  hopefully  gets typed into a computer  and someone can begin to analyze it  and once they have an analysis and a report  hopefully  then you can take the results of that data collection and use it to vaccinate children better. Because if there's anything worse in the field of global public health    I don't know what's worse than allowing children on this planet to die of vaccine preventable diseases    diseases for which the vaccine costs a dollar. And millions of children die of these diseases every year. And the fact is  millions is a gross estimate  because we don't really know how many kids die each year of this. What makes it even more frustrating is that the data entry part  the part that I used to do as a grad student  can take sometimes six months. Sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer  And sometimes  actually not infrequently  it actually never happens. Now try and wrap your head around that for a second. You just had teams of hundreds of people. They went out into the field to answer a particular question. You probably spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on fuel and photocopying and per diem. And then for some reason  momentum is lost or there's no money left  and all of that comes to nothing  because no one actually types it into the computer at all. The process just stops. Happens all the time. This is what we base our decisions on in global health  little data  old data  no data. So back in       I began to think about ways in which we could improve this process. Now         obviously  that was quite a long time ago. It kind of frightens me to think of how long ago that was. The top movie of the year was  Die Hard with a Vengeance.  As you can see  Bruce Willis had a lot more hair back then. I was working in the Centers for Disease Control and I had a lot more hair back then as well. But to me  the most significant thing that I saw in      was this. Hard for us to imagine  but in       this was the ultimate elite mobile device. It wasn't an iPhone. It wasn't a Galaxy phone. It was a PalmPilot. And when I saw the PalmPilot for the first time  I thought   Why can't we put the forms on these PalmPilots  And go out into the field just carrying one PalmPilot  which can hold the capacity of tens of thousands of paper forms  Why don't we try to do that  Because if we can do that  if we can actually just collect the data electronically  digitally  from the very beginning  we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of typing  of having somebody type that stuff into the computer. We can skip straight to the analysis and then straight to the use of the data to actually save lives.  So that's what I began to do. Working at CDC  I began to travel to different programs around the world and to train them in using PalmPilots to do data collection  instead of using paper. And it actually worked great. It worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted. What do you know  Digital data collection is actually more efficient than collecting on paper. While I was doing it  my business partner  Rose  who's here with her husband  Matthew  here in the audience  Rose was out doing similar stuff for the American Red Cross. The problem was  after a few years of doing that  I realized    I had been to maybe six or seven programs    and I thought  you know  if I keep this up at this pace  over my whole career  maybe I'm going to go to maybe    or    programs. But the problem is     or    programs  like  training    or    programs to use this technology  that is a tiny drop in the bucket. The demand for this  the need for data to run better programs just within health    not to mention all of the other fields in developing countries    is enormous. There are millions and millions and millions of programs  millions of clinics that need to track drugs  millions of vaccine programs. There are schools that need to track attendance. There are all these different things for us to get the data that we need to do. And I realized if I kept up the way that I was doing  I was basically hardly going to make any impact by the end of my career. And so I began to rack my brain  trying to think about  what was the process that I was doing  How was I training folks  and what were the bottlenecks and what were the obstacles to doing it faster and to doing it more efficiently  And  unfortunately  after thinking about this for some time  I identified the main obstacle. And the main obstacle  it turned out    and this is a sad realization    the main obstacle was me. So what do I mean by that  I had developed a process whereby I was the center of the universe of this technology. If you wanted to use this technology  you had to get in touch with me. That means you had to know I existed. Then you had to find the money to pay for me to fly out to your country and the money to pay for my hotel and my per diem and my daily rate. So you could be talking about     or     or        dollars  if I actually had the time or it fit my schedule and I wasn't on vacation. The point is that anything  any system that depends on a single human being or two or three or five human beings    it just doesn't scale. And this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology  and we need to scale it now. And so I began to think of ways in which I could basically take myself out of the picture. And  you know  I was thinking   How could I take myself out of the picture   for quite some time. I'd been trained that the way you distribute technology within international development is always consultant based. It's always guys that look pretty much like me  flying from countries that look pretty much like this to other countries with people with darker skin. And you go out there  and you spend money on airfare and you spend time and you spend per diem and you spend for a hotel and all that stuff. As far as I knew  that was the only way you could distribute technology  and I couldn't figure out a way around it. But the miracle that happened    I'm going to call it Hotmail for short. You may not think of Hotmail as being miraculous  but for me it was miraculous  because I noticed  just as I was wrestling with this problem    I was working in sub Saharan Africa  mostly  at the time    I noticed that every sub Saharan African health worker that I was working with had a Hotmail account. And it struck me   Wait a minute    I know the Hotmail people surely didn't fly to the Ministry of Health in Kenya to train people in how to use Hotmail. So these guys are distributing technology  getting software capacity out there  but they're not actually flying around the world. I need to think about this more.  While I was thinking about it  people started using even more things like this  just as we were. They started using LinkedIn and Flickr and Gmail and Google Maps    all these things. Of course  all of these things are cloud based and don't require any training. They don't require any programmers. They don't require consultants. Because the business model for all these businesses requires that something be so simple we can use it ourselves  with little or no training. You just have to hear about it and go to the website. And so I thought  what would happen if we built software to do what I'd been consulting in  Instead of training people how to put forms onto mobile devices  let's create software that lets them do it themselves with no training and without me being involved. And that's exactly what we did. So we created software called Magpi  which has an online form creator. No one has to speak to me  you just have to hear about it and go to the website. You can create forms  and once you've created the forms  you push them to a variety of common mobile phones. Obviously  nowadays  we've moved past PalmPilots to mobile phones. And it doesn't have to be a smartphone  it can be a basic phone  like the phone on the right  the basic Symbian phone that's very common in developing countries. And the great part about this is it's just like Hotmail. It's cloud based  and it doesn't require any training  programming  consultants. But there are some additional benefits as well. Now we knew when we built this system  the whole point of it  just like with the PalmPilots  was that you'd be able to collect the data and immediately upload the data and get your data set. But what we found  of course  since it's already on a computer  we can deliver instant maps and analysis and graphing. We can take a process that took two years and compress that down to the space of five minutes. Unbelievable improvements in efficiency. Cloud based  no training  no consultants  no me. And I told you that in the first few years of trying to do this the old fashioned way  going out to each country  we probably trained about       people. What happened after we did this  In the second three years  we had        people find the website  sign up and start using it to collect data  data for disaster response  Canadian pig farmers tracking pig disease and pig herds  people tracking drug supplies. One of my favorite examples  the IRC  International Rescue Committee  they have a program where semi literate midwives  using     mobile phones  send a text message using our software  once a week  with the number of births and the number of deaths  which gives IRC something that no one in global health has ever had  a near real time system of counting babies  of knowing how many kids are born  of knowing how many children there are in Sierra Leone  which is the country where this is happening  and knowing how many children die. Physicians for Human Rights    this is moving a little bit outside the health field    they're basically training people to do rape exams in Congo  where this is an epidemic  a horrible epidemic  and they're using our software to document the evidence they find  including photographically  so that they can bring the perpetrators to justice. Camfed  another charity based out of the UK    Camfed pays girls' families to keep them in school. They understand this is the most significant intervention they can make. They used to track the disbursements  the attendance  the grades  on paper. The turnaround time between a teacher writing down grades or attendance and getting that into a report was about two to three years. Now it's real time. And because this is such a low cost system and based in the cloud  it costs  for the entire five countries that Camfed runs this in  with tens of thousands of girls  the whole cost combined is        dollars a year. That's less than I used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation. So I told you before that when we were doing it the old fashioned way  I realized all of our work was really adding up to just a drop in the bucket               different programs. We've made a lot of progress  but I recognize that right now  even the work that we've done with        people using this is still a drop in the bucket. But something's changed  and I think it should be obvious. What's changed now is  instead of having a program in which we're scaling at such a slow rate that we can never reach all the people who need us  we've made it unnecessary for people to get reached by us. We've created a tool that lets programs keep kids in school  track the number of babies that are born and the number of babies that die  catch criminals and successfully prosecute them    to do all these different things to learn more about what's going on  to understand more  to see more ... and to save lives and improve lives. Thank you. Throughout the history of computers we've been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information  the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild. And this gap has become shorter  shorter  and even shorter  and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter  the thickness of a touch screen glass  and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone. But I wondered  what if there could be no boundary at all  I started to imagine what this would look like. First  I created this tool which penetrates into the digital space  so when you press it hard on the screen  it transfers its physical body into pixels. Designers can materialize their ideas directly in  D  and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen. So with this tool  this boundary has been broken. But our two hands still remain outside the screen. How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands  At Microsoft Applied Sciences  along with my mentor Cati Boulanger  I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace. By combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face  now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this  D space and grab pixels with your bare hands. Because windows and files have a position in the real space  selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf. Then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines  words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window. Architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly. So in these examples  we are reaching into the digital world. But how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead  I'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online. But now you don't have to worry about it. What I got here is an online augmented fitting room. This is a view that you get from head mounted or see through display when the system understands the geometry of your body. Taking this idea further  I started to think  instead of just seeing these pixels in our space  how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it  What would such a future look like  At MIT Media Lab  along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Rehmi Post  we created this one physical pixel. Well  in this case  this spherical magnet acts like a  D pixel in our space  which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little  D space. What we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies. And by digitally programming the object  we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space  which means that now  human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world. So choreography can be taught physically over distance and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality. Students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion  physics  and unlike computer screens or textbooks  this is a real  tangible experience that you can touch and feel  and it's very powerful. And what's more exciting than just turning what's currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities. As you can see  the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world. Today  we started by talking about the boundary  but if we remove this boundary  the only boundary left is our imagination. Thank you. When we talk about corruption  there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind. There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs. Saparmurat Niyazov  he was one of them. Until his death in       he was the all powerful leader of Turkmenistan  a Central Asian country rich in natural gas. Now  he really loved to issue presidential decrees. And one renamed the months of the year including after himself and his mother. He spent millions of dollars creating a bizarre personality cult  and his crowning glory was the building of a    foot high gold plated statue of himself which stood proudly in the capital's central square and rotated to follow the sun. He was a slightly unusual guy. And then there's that clich   the African dictator or minister or official. There's Teodor n Obiang. So his daddy is president for life of Equatorial Guinea  a West African nation that has exported billions of dollars of oil since the     s and yet has a truly appalling human rights record. The vast majority of its people are living in really miserable poverty despite an income per capita that's on a par with that of Portugal. So Obiang junior  well  he buys himself a     million mansion in Malibu  California. I've been up to its front gates. I can tell you it's a magnificent spread. He bought an     million art collection that used to belong to fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent  a stack of fabulous sports cars  some costing a million dollars apiece    oh  and a Gulfstream jet  too. Now get this  Until recently  he was earning an official monthly salary of less than       dollars. And there's Dan Etete. Well  he was the former oil minister of Nigeria under President Abacha  and it just so happens he's a convicted money launderer too. We've spent a great deal of time investigating a    billion    that's right  a    billion   oil deal that he was involved with  and what we found was pretty shocking  but more about that later. So it's easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there  carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries that we  personally  may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected by what might be going on. But does it just happen over there  Well  at     I was very lucky. My first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African ivory. And that's how my relationship with corruption really began. In       with two friends who were colleagues  Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley  we set up an organization called Global Witness. Our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in Cambodia. So a few years later  and it's now       and I'm in Angola undercover investigating blood diamonds. Perhaps you saw the film  the Hollywood film  Blood Diamond   the one with Leonardo DiCaprio. Well  some of that sprang from our work. Luanda  it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the streets  and a tiny  very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to Brazil and Portugal. And it was a slightly crazy place. So I'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room feeling just totally overwhelmed. But it wasn't about blood diamonds. Because I'd been speaking to lots of people there who  well  they talked about a different problem  that of a massive web of corruption on a global scale and millions of oil dollars going missing. And for what was then a very small organization of just a few people  trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge. And in the years that I've been  and we've all been campaigning and investigating  I've repeatedly seen that what makes corruption on a global  massive scale possible  well it isn't just greed or the misuse of power or that nebulous phrase  weak governance.  I mean  yes  it's all of those  but corruption  it's made possible by the actions of global facilitators. So let's go back to some of those people I talked about earlier. Now  they're all people we've investigated  and they're all people who couldn't do what they do alone. Take Obiang junior. Well  he didn't end up with high end art and luxury houses without help. He did business with global banks. A bank in Paris held accounts of companies controlled by him  one of which was used to buy the art  and American banks  well  they funneled    million dollars into the States  some of which was used to buy that California mansion. And he didn't do all of this in his own name either. He used shell companies. He used one to buy the property  and another  which was in somebody else's name  to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place. And then there's Dan Etete. Well  when he was oil minister  he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars to a company that  guess what  yeah  he was the hidden owner of. Now  it was then much later traded on with the kind assistance of the Nigerian government    now I have to be careful what I say here   to subsidiaries of Shell and the Italian Eni  two of the biggest oil companies around. So the reality is  is that the engine of corruption  well  it exists far beyond the shores of countries like Equatorial Guinea or Nigeria or Turkmenistan. This engine  well  it's driven by our international banking system  by the problem of anonymous shell companies  and by the secrecy that we have afforded big oil  gas and mining operations  and  most of all  by the failure of our politicians to back up their rhetoric and do something really meaningful and systemic to tackle this stuff. Now let's take the banks first. Well  it's not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money  but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too. For example  in Sarawak  Malaysia. Now this region  it has just five percent of its forests left intact. Five percent. So how did that happen  Well  because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years. So we sent an undercover investigator in to secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite  and the resulting footage  well  it made some people very angry  and you can see that on YouTube  but it proved what we had long suspected  because it showed how the state's chief minister  despite his later denials  used his control over land and forest licenses to enrich himself and his family. And HSBC  well  we know that HSBC bankrolled the region's largest logging companies that were responsible for some of that destruction in Sarawak and elsewhere. The bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process  but it earned around     million dollars. Now shortly after our expos   very shortly after our expos  earlier this year  the bank announced a policy review on this. And is this progress  Maybe  but we're going to be keeping a very close eye on that case. And then there's the problem of anonymous shell companies. Well  we've all heard about what they are  I think  and we all know they're used quite a bit by people and companies who are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society  also known as taxes. But what doesn't usually come to light is how shell companies are used to steal huge sums of money  transformational sums of money  from poor countries. In virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated  shell companies have appeared  and sometimes it's been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal. A recent study by the World Bank looked at     cases of corruption. It found that over    percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies  totaling almost    billion dollars. Now many of these companies were in America or the United Kingdom  its overseas territories and Crown dependencies  and so it's not just an offshore problem  it's an on shore one too. You see  shell companies  they're central to the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites rather than ordinary citizens. One striking recent case that we've investigated is how the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo sold off a series of valuable  state owned mining assets to shell companies in the British Virgin Islands. So we spoke to sources in country  trawled through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal. And we were alarmed to find that these shell companies had quickly flipped many of the assets on for huge profits to major international mining companies listed in London. Now  the Africa Progress Panel  led by Kofi Annan  they've calculated that Congo may have lost more than  .  billion dollars from these deals. That's almost twice the country's annual health and education budget combined. And will the people of Congo  will they ever get their money back  Well  the answer to that question  and who was really involved and what really happened  well that's going to probably remain locked away in the secretive company registries of the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere unless we all do something about it. And how about the oil  gas and mining companies  Okay  maybe it's a bit of a clich  to talk about them. Corruption in that sector  no surprise. There's corruption everywhere  so why focus on that sector  Well  because there's a lot at stake. In       natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost    to one in Africa  Asia and Latin America. Nineteen to one. Now that's a hell of a lot of schools and universities and hospitals and business startups  many of which haven't materialized and never will because some of that money has simply been stolen away. Now let's go back to the oil and mining companies  and let's go back to Dan Etete and that    billion deal. And now forgive me  I'm going to read the next bit because it's a very live issue  and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right. Now  on the surface  the deal appeared straightforward. Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni paid the Nigerian government for the block. The Nigerian government transferred precisely the same amount  to the very dollar  to an account earmarked for a shell company whose hidden owner was Etete. Now  that's not bad going for a convicted money launderer. And here's the thing. After many months of digging around and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents  we found evidence that  in fact  Shell and Eni had known that the funds would be transferred to that shell company  and frankly  it's hard to believe they didn't know who they were really dealing with there. Now  it just shouldn't take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went. I mean  these are state assets. They're supposed to be used for the benefit of the people in the country. But in some countries  citizens and journalists who are trying to expose stories like this have been harassed and arrested and some have even risked their lives to do so. And finally  well  there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable. It's just how some business is done. It's too complex and difficult to change. So in effect  what  We just accept it. But as a campaigner and investigator  I have a different view  because I've seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum. In the oil and mining sector  for example  there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems. In       when Global Witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent  well  some people laughed at the extreme naivet  of that small idea. But literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency  and now it's fast becoming the norm and the law. Two thirds of the value of the world's oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws. Two thirds. So this is change happening. This is progress. But we're not there yet  by far. Because it really isn't about corruption somewhere over there  is it  In a globalized world  corruption is a truly globalized business  and one that needs global solutions  supported and pushed by us all  as global citizens  right here. Thank you. This is my grandfather. And this is my son. My grandfather taught me to work with wood when I was a little boy  and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something  honor that tree's life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can. My little boy reminded me that for all the technology and all the toys in the world  sometimes just a small block of wood  if you stack it up tall  actually is an incredibly inspiring thing. These are my buildings. I build all around the world out of our office in Vancouver and New York. And we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials  depending on where we are. But wood is the material that I love the most  and I'm going to tell you the story about wood. And part of the reason I love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood  I notice they react completely differently. I've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings and hug a steel or a concrete column  but I've actually seen that happen in a wood building. I've actually seen how people touch the wood  and I think there's a reason for it. Just like snowflakes  no two pieces of wood can ever be the same anywhere on Earth. That's a wonderful thing. I like to think that wood gives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings. It's Mother Nature's fingerprints that make our buildings connect us to nature in the built environment. Now  I live in Vancouver  near a forest that grows to    stories tall. Down the coast here in California  the redwood forest grows to    stories tall. But the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on Earth. Even building codes actually limit the ability for us to build much taller than four stories in many places  and that's true here in the United States. Now there are exceptions  but there needs to be some exceptions  and things are going to change  I'm hoping. And the reason I think that way is that today half of us live in cities  and that number is going to grow to    percent. Cities and density mean that our buildings are going to continue to be big  and I think there's a role for wood to play in cities. And I feel that way because three billion people in the world today  over the next    years  will need a new home. That's    percent of the world that are going to need a new building built for them in the next    years. Now  one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum. That's one billion people in the world live in slums. A hundred million people in the world are homeless. The scale of the challenge for architects and for society to deal with in building is to find a solution to house these people. But the challenge is  as we move to cities  cities are built in these two materials  steel and concrete  and they're great materials. They're the materials of the last century. But they're also materials with very high energy and very high greenhouse gas emissions in their process. Steel represents about three percent of man's greenhouse gas emissions  and concrete is over five percent. So if you think about that  eight percent of our contribution to greenhouse gases today comes from those two materials alone. We don't think about it a lot  and unfortunately  we actually don't even think about buildings  I think  as much as we should. This is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases. Almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry  and if we look at energy  it's the same story. You'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list  but that's the conversation we mostly hear about. And although a lot of that is about energy  it's also so much about carbon. The problem I see is that  ultimately  the clash of how we solve that problem of serving those three billion people that need a home  and climate change  are a head on collision about to happen  or already happening. That challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways  and I think wood is going to be part of that solution  and I'm going to tell you the story of why. As an architect  wood is the only material  big material  that I can build with that's already grown by the power of the sun. When a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide  and it dies and it falls to the forest floor  it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground. If it burns in a forest fire  it's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well. But if you take that wood and you put it into a building or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy  it actually has an amazing capacity to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration. One cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide. Now our two solutions to climate are obviously to reduce our emissions and find storage. Wood is the only major material building material I can build with that actually does both those two things. So I believe that we have an ethic that the Earth grows our food  and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the Earth should grow our homes. Now  how are we going to do that when we're urbanizing at this rate and we think about wood buildings only at four stories  We need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger  and what we've been working on is    story tall buildings made of wood. We've been engineering them with an engineer named Eric Karsh who works with me on it  and we've been doing this new work because there are new wood products out there for us to use  and we call them mass timber panels. These are panels made with young trees  small growth trees  small pieces of wood glued together to make panels that are enormous  eight feet wide     feet long  and of various thicknesses. The way I describe this best  I've found  is to say that we're all used to two by four construction when we think about wood. That's what people jump to as a conclusion. Two by four construction is sort of like the little eight dot bricks of Lego that we all played with as kids  and you can make all kinds of cool things out of Lego at that size  and out of two by fours. But do remember when you were a kid  and you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement  and you found that big    dot brick of Lego  and you were kind of like   Cool  this is awesome. I can build something really big  and this is going to be great.  That's the change. Mass timber panels are those    dot bricks. They're changing the scale of what we can do  and what we've developed is something we call FFTT  which is a Creative Commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to. This animation shows you how the building goes together in a very simple way  but these buildings are available for architects and engineers now to build on for different cultures in the world  different architectural styles and characters. In order for us to build safely  we've engineered these buildings  actually  to work in a Vancouver context  where we're a high seismic zone  even at    stories tall. Now obviously  every time I bring this up  people even  you know  here at the conference  say   Are you serious  Thirty stories  How's that going to happen   And there's a lot of really good questions that are asked and important questions that we spent quite a long time working on the answers to as we put together our report and the peer reviewed report. I'm just going to focus on a few of them  and let's start with fire  because I think fire is probably the first one that you're all thinking about right now. Fair enough. And the way I describe it is this. If I asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire  it doesn't happen  right  We all know that. But to build a fire  you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up  and eventually you can add the log to the fire  and when you do add the log to the fire  of course  it burns  but it burns slowly. Well  mass timber panels  these new products that we're using  are much like the log. It's hard to start them on fire  and when they do  they actually burn extraordinarily predictably  and we can use fire science in order to predict and make these buildings as safe as concrete and as safe as steel. The next big issue  deforestation. Eighteen percent of our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide is the result of deforestation. The last thing we want to do is cut down trees. Or  the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees. There are models for sustainable forestry that allow us to cut trees properly  and those are the only trees appropriate to use for these kinds of systems. Now I actually think that these ideas will change the economics of deforestation. In countries with deforestation issues  we need to find a way to provide better value for the forest and actually encourage people to make money through very fast growth cycles                 year old trees that make these products and allow us to build at this scale. We've calculated a    story building  We'll grow enough wood in North America every    minutes. That's how much it takes. The carbon story here is a really good one. If we built a    story building out of cement and concrete  the process would result in the manufacturing of that cement and       tonnes of carbon dioxide. If we did it in wood  in this solution  we'd sequester about       tonnes  for a net difference of       tonnes. That's the equivalent of about     cars removed from the road in one year. Think back to that three billion people that need a new home  and maybe this is a contributor to reducing. We're at the beginning of a revolution  I hope  in the way we build  because this is the first new way to build a skyscraper in probably     years or more. But the challenge is changing society's perception of possibility  and it's a huge challenge. The engineering is  truthfully  the easy part of this. And the way I describe it is this. The first skyscraper  technically    and the definition of a skyscraper is    stories tall  believe it or not   but the first skyscraper was this one in Chicago  and people were terrified to walk underneath this building. But only four years after it was built  Gustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower  and as he built the Eiffel Tower  he changed the skylines of the cities of the world  changed and created a competition between places like New York City and Chicago  where developers started building bigger and bigger buildings and pushing the envelope up higher and higher with better and better engineering. We built this model in New York  actually  as a theoretical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come  and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like  because the exterior can change. It's really just the structure that we're talking about. The reason we picked it is because this is a technical university  and I believe that wood is the most technologically advanced material I can build with. It just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent  and we don't really feel comfortable with it. But that's the way it should be  nature's fingerprints in the built environment. I'm looking for this opportunity to create an Eiffel Tower moment  we call it. Buildings are starting to go up around the world. There's a building in London that's nine stories  a new building that just finished in Australia that I believe is    or   . We're starting to push the height up of these wood buildings  and we're hoping  and I'm hoping  that my hometown of Vancouver actually potentially announces the world's tallest at around    stories in the not so distant future. That Eiffel Tower moment will break the ceiling  these arbitrary ceilings of height  and allow wood buildings to join the competition. And I believe the race is ultimately on. Thank you. Diana Reiss  You may think you're looking through a window at a dolphin spinning playfully  but what you're actually looking through is a two way mirror at a dolphin looking at itself spinning playfully. This is a dolphin that is self aware. This dolphin has self awareness. It's a young dolphin named Bayley. I've been very interested in understanding the nature of the intelligence of dolphins for the past    years. How do we explore intelligence in this animal that's so different from us  And what I've used is a very simple research tool  a mirror  and we've gained great information  reflections of these animal minds. Dolphins aren't the only animals  the only non human animals  to show mirror self recognition. We used to think this was a uniquely human ability  but we learned that the great apes  our closest relatives  also show this ability. Then we showed it in dolphins  and then later in elephants. We did this work in my lab with the dolphins and elephants  and it's been recently shown in the magpie. Now  it's interesting  because we've embraced this Darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution  this physical continuity. But we've been much more reticent  much slower at recognizing this continuity in cognition  in emotion  in consciousness in other animals. Other animals are conscious. They're emotional. They're aware. There have been multitudes of studies with many species over the years that have given us exquisite evidence for thinking and consciousness in other animals  other animals that are quite different than we are in form. We are not alone. We are not alone in these abilities. And I hope  and one of my biggest dreams  is that  with our growing awareness about the consciousness of others and our relationship with the rest of the animal world  that we'll give them the respect and protection that they deserve. So that's a wish I'm throwing out here for everybody  and I hope I can really engage you in this idea. Now  I want to return to dolphins  because these are the animals that I feel like I've been working up closely and personal with for over    years. And these are real personalities. They are not persons  but they're personalities in every sense of the word. And you can't get more alien than the dolphin. They are very different from us in body form. They're radically different. They come from a radically different environment. In fact  we're separated by    million years of divergent evolution. Look at this body. And in every sense of making a pun here  these are true non terrestrials. I wondered how we might interface with these animals. In the     s  I developed an underwater keyboard. This was a custom made touch screen keyboard. What I wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control. These are big brains  highly social animals  and I thought  well  if we give them choice and control  if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard    and by the way  it was interfaced by fiber optic cables from Hewlett Packard with an Apple II computer. This seems prehistoric now  but this was where we were with technology. So the dolphins could hit a key  a symbol  they heard a computer generated whistle  and they got an object or activity. Now here's a little video. This is Delphi and Pan  and you're going to see Delphi hitting a key  he hears a computer generated whistle     Whistle     and gets a ball  so they can actually ask for things they want. What was remarkable is  they explored this keyboard on their own. There was no intervention on our part. They explored the keyboard. They played around with it. They figured out how it worked. And they started to quickly imitate the sounds they were hearing on the keyboard. They imitated on their own. Beyond that  though  they started learning associations between the symbols  the sounds and the objects. What we saw was self organized learning  and now I'm imagining  what can we do with new technologies  How can we create interfaces  new windows into the minds of animals  with the technologies that exist today  So I was thinking about this  and then  one day  I got a call from Peter. Peter Gabriel  I make noises for a living. On a good day  it's music  and I want to talk a little bit about the most amazing music making experience I ever had. I'm a farm boy. I grew up surrounded by animals  and I would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there  So as an adult  when I started to read about the amazing breakthroughs with Penny Patterson and Koko  with Sue Savage Rumbaugh and Kanzi  Panbanisha  Irene Pepperberg  Alex the parrot  I got all excited. What was amazing to me also was they seemed a lot more adept at getting a handle on our language than we were on getting a handle on theirs. I work with a lot of musicians from around the world  and often we don't have any common language at all  but we sit down behind our instruments  and suddenly there's a way for us to connect and emote. So I started cold calling  and eventually got through to Sue Savage Rumbaugh  and she invited me down. I went down  and the bonobos had had access to percussion instruments  musical toys  but never before to a keyboard. At first they did what infants do  just bashed it with their fists  and then I asked  through Sue  if Panbanisha could try with one finger only. Sue Savage Rumbaugh  Can you play a grooming song  I want to hear a grooming song. Play a real quiet grooming song. PG  So groom was the subject of the piece. So I'm just behind  jamming  yeah  this is what we started with. Sue's encouraging her to continue a little more. She discovers a note she likes  finds the octave. She'd never sat at a keyboard before. Nice triplets. SSR  You did good. That was very good. PG  She hit good. So that night  we began to dream  and we thought  perhaps the most amazing tool that man's created is the Internet  and what would happen if we could somehow find new interfaces  visual audio interfaces that would allow these remarkable sentient beings that we share the planet with access  And Sue Savage Rumbaugh got excited about that  called her friend Steve Woodruff  and we began hustling all sorts of people whose work related or was inspiring  which led us to Diana  and led us to Neil. Neil Gershenfeld  Thanks  Peter. PG  Thank you. NG  So Peter approached me. I lost it when I saw that clip. He approached me with a vision of doing these things not for people  for animals. And then I was struck in the history of the Internet. This is what the Internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the Internet of middle aged white men  mostly middle aged white men. Vint Cerf   Laughs  NG  Speaking as one. Then  when I first came to TED  which was where I met Peter  I showed this. This is a    web server  and at the time that was radical. And the possibility of making a web server for a dollar grew into what became known as the Internet of Things  which is literally an industry now with tremendous implications for health care  energy efficiency. And we were happy with ourselves. And then when Peter showed me that  I realized we had missed something  which is the rest of the planet. So we started up this interspecies Internet project. Now we started talking with TED about how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants to TED  and we realized that wouldn't work. So we're going to bring you to them. So if we could switch to the audio from this computer  we've been video conferencing with cognitive animals  and we're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them. And so if we could also have this up  great. So the first site we're going to meet is Cameron Park Zoo in Waco  with orangutans. In the daytime they live outside. It's nighttime there now. So can you please go ahead  Terri Cox  Hi  I'm Terri Cox with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco  Texas  and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei  two of our Bornean orangutans. During the day  they have a beautiful  large outdoor habitat  and at night  they come into this habitat  into their night quarters  where they can have a climate controlled and secure environment to sleep in. We participate in the Apps for Apes program Orangutan Outreach  and we use iPads to help stimulate and enrich the animals  and also help raise awareness for these critically endangered animals. And they share    percent of our DNA and are incredibly intelligent  so it's so exciting to think of all the opportunities that we have via technology and the Internet to really enrich their lives and open up their world. We're really excited about the possibility of an interspecies Internet  and K.J. has been enjoying the conference very much. NG  That's great. When we were rehearsing last night  he had fun watching the elephants. Next user group are the dolphins at the National Aquarium. Please go ahead. Allison Ginsburg  Good evening. Well  my name is Allison Ginsburg  and we're live in Baltimore at the National Aquarium. Joining me are three of our eight Atlantic bottlenose dolphins     year old Chesapeake  who was our first dolphin born here  her four year old daughter Bayley  and her half sister     year old Maya. Now  here at the National Aquarium we are committed to excellence in animal care  to research  and to conservation. The dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what's going on here tonight. They're not really used to having cameras here at   o'clock at night. In addition  we are very committed to doing different types of research. As Diana mentioned  our animals are involved in many different research studies. NG  Those are for you. Okay  that's great  thank you. And the third user group  in Thailand  is Think Elephants. Go ahead  Josh. Josh Plotnik  Hi  my name is Josh Plotnik  and I'm with Think Elephants International  and we're here in the Golden Triangle of Thailand with the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation elephants. And we have    elephants here  and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants  but our foundation Think Elephants is focused on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world virtually like this and showing people how incredible these animals are. So we're able to bring the camera right up to the elephant  put food into the elephant's mouth  show people what's going on inside their mouths  and show everyone around the world how incredible these animals really are. NG  Okay  that's great. Thanks Josh. And once again  we've been building great relationships among them just since we've been rehearsing. So at that point  if we can go back to the other computer  we were starting to think about how you integrate the rest of the biomass of the planet into the Internet  and we went to the best possible person I can think of  which is Vint Cerf  who is one of the founders who gave us the Internet. Vint  VC  Thank you  Neil. A long time ago in a galaxy   oops  wrong script. Forty years ago  Bob Kahn and I did the design of the Internet. Thirty years ago  we turned it on. Just last year  we turned on the production Internet. You've been using the experimental version for the last    years. The production version  it uses IP version  . It has  .  times    to the   th possible terminations. That's a number only that Congress can appreciate. But it leads to what is coming next. When Bob and I did this design  we thought we were building a system to connect computers together. What we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together. And what you've seen tonight tells you that we should not restrict this network to one species  that these other intelligent  sentient species should be part of the system too. This is the system as it looks today  by the way. This is what the Internet looks like to a computer that's trying to figure out where the traffic is supposed to go. This is generated by a program that's looking at the connectivity of the Internet  and how all the various networks are connected together. There are about         networks  interconnected  run independently by         different operating agencies  and the only reason this works is that they all use the same standard TCP IP protocols. Well  you know where this is headed. The Internet of Things tell us that a lot of computer enabled appliances and devices are going to become part of this system too  appliances that you use around the house  that you use in your office  that you carry around with yourself or in the car. That's the Internet of Things that's coming. Now  what's important about what these people are doing is that they're beginning to learn how to communicate with species that are not us but share a common sensory environment. We're beginning to explore what it means to communicate with something that isn't just another person. Well  you can see what's coming next. All kinds of possible sentient beings may be interconnected through this system  and I can't wait to see these experiments unfold. What happens after that  Well  let's see. There are machines that need to talk to machines and that we need to talk to  and so as time goes on  we're going to have to learn how to communicate with computers and how to get computers to communicate with us in the way that we're accustomed to  not with keyboards  not with mice  but with speech and gestures and all the natural human language that we're accustomed to. So we'll need something like C PO to become a translator between ourselves and some of the other machines we live with. Now  there is a project that's underway called the interplanetary Internet. It's in operation between Earth and Mars. It's operating on the International Space Station. It's part of the spacecraft that's in orbit around the Sun that's rendezvoused with two planets. So the interplanetary system is on its way  but there's a last project  which the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  which funded the original ARPANET  funded the Internet  funded the interplanetary architecture  is now funding a project to design a spacecraft to get to the nearest star in     years' time. What that means is that what we're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us  ultimately  how we might interact with an alien from another world. I can hardly wait. June Cohen  So first of all  thank you  and I would like to acknowledge that four people who could talk to us for full four days actually managed to stay to four minutes each  and we thank you for that. I have so many questions  but maybe a few practical things that the audience might want to know. You're launching this idea here at TED   PG  Today. JC  Today. This is the first time you're talking about it. Tell me a little bit about where you're going to take the idea. What's next  PG  I think we want to engage as many people here as possible in helping us think of smart interfaces that will make all this possible. NG  And just mechanically  there's a     c     and web infrastructure and all of that  but it's not quite ready to turn on  so we'll roll that out  and contact us if you want the information on it. The idea is this will be    much like the Internet functions as a network of networks  which is Vint's core contribution  this will be a wrapper around all of these initiatives  that are wonderful individually  to link them globally. JC  Right  and do you have a web address that we might look for yet  NG  Shortly. JC  Shortly. We will come back to you on that. And very quickly  just to clarify. Some people might have looked at the video that you showed and thought  well  that's just a webcam. What's special about it  If you could talk for just a moment about how you want to go past that  NG  So this is scalable video infrastructure  not for a few to a few but many to many  so that it scales to symmetrical video sharing and content sharing across these sites around the planet. So there's a lot of back end signal processing  not for one to many  but for many to many. JC  Right  and then on a practical level  which technologies are you looking at first  I know you mentioned that a keyboard is a really key part of this. DR  We're trying to develop an interactive touch screen for dolphins. This is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work  and we just got our first seed money today towards that  so it's our first project. JC  Before the talk  even. DR  Yeah. JC  Wow. Well done. All right  well thank you all so much for joining us. It's such a delight to have you on the stage. DR  Thank you. VC  Thank you. Have you ever experienced a moment in your life that was so painful and confusing  that all you wanted to do was learn as much as you could to make sense of it all  When I was     a close family friend who was like an uncle to me passed away from pancreatic cancer. When the disease hit so close to home  I knew I needed to learn more. So I went online to find answers. Using the Internet  I found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer  and what I had found shocked me. Over    percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late  when someone has less than a two percent chance of survival. Why are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer  The reason  Today's current  modern  medicine is a    year old technique. That's older than my dad. But also  it's extremely expensive  costing     dollars per test  and it's grossly inaccurate  missing    percent of all pancreatic cancers. Your doctor would have to be ridiculously suspicious that you have the cancer in order to give you this test. Learning this  I knew there had to be a better way. So  I set up scientific criteria as to what a sensor would have to look like in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer. The sensor would have to be  inexpensive  rapid  simple  sensitive  selective  and minimally invasive. Now  there's a reason why this test hasn't been updated in over six decades. And that's because when we're looking for pancreatic cancer  we're looking at your bloodstream  which is already abundant in all these tons and tons of protein  and you're looking for this miniscule difference in this tiny amount of protein. Just this one protein. That's next to impossible. However  undeterred due to my teenage optimism    I went online to a teenager's two best friends  Google and Wikipedia. I got everything for my homework from those two sources. And what I had found was an article that listed a database of over       different proteins that are found when you have pancreatic cancer. So  I decided to go and make it my new mission to go through all these proteins  and see which ones could serve as a bio marker for pancreatic cancer. And to make it a bit simpler for myself  I decided to map out scientific criteria  and here it is. Essentially  first  the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers  at high levels in the bloodstream  in the earliest stages  but also only in cancer. And so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task  and finally  on the      th try  when I'm close to losing my sanity  I find the protein. And the name of the protein I'd located was called mesothelin  and it's just your ordinary  run of the mill type protein  unless  of course  you have pancreatic  ovarian or lung cancer  in which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream. But also  the key is that it's found in the earliest stages of the disease  when someone has close to     percent chance of survival. So now that I'd found a reliable protein I could detect  I then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein  and thus  pancreatic cancer. Now  my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place  possibly the most unlikely place for innovation    my high school biology class  the absolute stifler of innovation. And I had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes  and that's just a long  thin pipe of carbon that's an atom thick  and one       th the diameter of your hair. And despite their extremely small sizes  they have these incredible properties. They're kind of like the superheroes of material science. And while I was sneakily reading this article under my desk in my biology class  we were supposed to be paying attention to these other kind of cool molecules  called antibodies. And these are pretty cool because they only react with one specific protein  but they're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes. And so then  I was sitting in class  and suddenly it hit me  I could combine what I was reading about  carbon nanotubes  with what I was supposed to be thinking about  antibodies. Essentially  I could weave a bunch of these antibodies into a network of carbon nanotubes  such that you have a network that only reacts with one protein  but also  due to the properties of these nanotubes  it will change its electrical properties  based on the amount of protein present. However  there's a catch. These networks of carbon nanotubes are extremely flimsy. And since they're so delicate  they need to be supported. So that's why I chose to use paper. Making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies  which I love. You start with some water  pour in some nanotubes  add antibodies  mix it up  take some paper  dip it  dry it  and you can detect cancer. Then  suddenly  a thought occurred that kind of put a blemish on my amazing plan here. I can't really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop. My mom wouldn't really like that. So instead  I decided to go for a lab. So I typed up a budget  a materials list  a timeline  and a procedure  and I emailed it to     different professors at Johns Hopkins University and the National Institutes of Health    essentially  anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer. I sat back waiting for these positive emails to be pouring in  saying   You're a genius  You're going to save us all   And    Then reality took hold  and over the course of a month  I got     rejections out of those     emails. One professor even went through my entire procedure  painstakingly    I'm not really sure where he got all this time    and he went through and said why each and every step was like the worst mistake I could ever make. Clearly  the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as I did. However  there is a silver lining. One professor said   Maybe I might be able to help you  kid.  So  I went in that direction. As you can never say no to a kid. And so then  three months later  I finally nailed down a harsh deadline with this guy  and I get into his lab  I get all excited  and then I sit down  I start opening my mouth and talking  and five seconds later  he calls in another Ph.D. Ph.D.s just flock into this little room  and they're just firing these questions at me  and by the end  I kind of felt like I was in a clown car. There were    Ph.D.s  plus me and the professor crammed into this tiny office space  with them firing these rapid fire questions at me  trying to sink my procedure. How unlikely is that  I mean  pshhh. However  subjecting myself to that interrogation    I answered all their questions  and I guessed on quite a few but I got them right    and I finally landed the lab space I needed. But it was shortly afterwards that I discovered my once brilliant procedure had something like a million holes in it  and over the course of seven months  I painstakingly filled each and every one of those holes. The result  One small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run. This makes it     times faster  over        times less expensive  and over     times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection. One of the best parts of the sensor  though  is that it has close to     percent accuracy  and can detect the cancer in the earliest stages  when someone has close to     percent chance of survival. And so in the next two to five years  this sensor could potentially lift the pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal  .  percent to close to     percent  and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer. But it wouldn't stop there. By switching out that antibody  you can look at a different protein  thus  a different disease    potentially any disease in the entire world. So that ranges from heart disease  to malaria  HIV  AIDS  as well as other forms of cancer    anything. And so  hopefully one day  we can all have that one extra uncle  that one mother  that one brother  sister  we can have that one more family member to love. And that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden that comes from pancreatic  ovarian and lung cancer  and potentially any disease. But through the Internet  anything is possible. Theories can be shared  and you don't have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued. It's a neutral space  where what you look like  age or gender    it doesn't matter. It's just your ideas that count. For me  it's all about looking at the Internet in an entirely new way  to realize that there's so much more to it than just posting duck face pictures of yourself online. You could be changing the world. So if a    year old who didn't even know what a pancreas was could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer    just imagine what you could do. Thank you. I'd like to talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education  by comparison. If you talk to someone today in America about sexual activity  you'll find pretty soon you're not just talking about sexual activity. You're also talking about baseball. Because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that Americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity  and we know that because there's all this language in English that seems to be talking about baseball but that's really talking about sexual activity. So  for example  you can be a pitcher or a catcher  and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act. Of course  there are the bases  which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order  ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run  which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm  at least for the guy. You can strike out  which means you don't get to have any sexual activity. And if you're a benchwarmer  you might be a virgin or somebody who for whatever reason isn't in the game  maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skillset. A bat's a penis  and a nappy dugout is a vulva  or a vagina. A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom. A switch hitter is a bisexual person  and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team. And then there's this one   if there's grass on the field  play ball.  And that usually refers to if a young person  specifically often a young woman  is old enough to have pubic hair  she's old enough to have sex with. This baseball model is incredibly problematic. It's sexist. It's heterosexist. It's competitive. It's goal directed. And it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults. So we need a new model. I'm here today to offer you that new model. And it's based on pizza. Now pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience. So let's do this. Let's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity  the trigger for sexual activity  what happens during sexual activity  and the expected outcome of sexual activity. So when do you play baseball  You play baseball when it's baseball season and when there's a game on the schedule. It's not exactly your choice. So if it's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren't home  hey  it's just batter up. Can you imagine saying to your coach   Uh  I'm not really feeling it today  I think I'll sit this game out.  That's just not the way it happens. And when you get together to play baseball  immediately you're with two opposing teams  one playing offense  one playing defense  somebody's trying to move deeper into the field. That's usually a sign to the boy. Somebody's trying to defend people moving into the field. That's often given to the girl. It's competitive. We're not playing with each other. We're playing against each other. And when you show up to play baseball  nobody needs to talk about what we're going to do or how this baseball game might be good for us. Everybody knows the rules. You just take your position and play the game. But when do you have pizza  Well  you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza. It starts with an internal sense  an internal desire  or a need.  Huh. I could go for some pizza.  And because it's an internal desire  we actually have some sense of control over that. I could decide that I'm hungry but know that it's not a great time to eat. And then when we get together with someone for pizza  we're not competing with them  we're looking for an experience that both of us will share that's satisfying for both of us  and when you get together for pizza with somebody  what's the first thing you do  You talk about it. You talk about what you want. You talk about what you like. You may even negotiate it.  How do you feel about pepperoni    Laughter   Not so much  I'm kind of a mushroom guy myself.   Well  maybe we can go half and half.  And even if you've had pizza with somebody for a very long time  don't you still say things like   Should we get the usual    Or maybe something a little more adventurous   Okay  so when you're playing baseball  so if we talk about during sexual activity  when you're playing baseball  you're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time. You can't hit the ball and run to right field. That doesn't work. And you also can't get to second base and say   I like it here. I'm going to stay here.  No. And also  of course  with baseball  there's  like  the specific equipment and a specific skill set. Not everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive. Okay  but what about pizza  When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza  isn't it all about what's our pleasure  There are a million different kinds of pizza. There's a million different toppings. There's a million different ways to eat pizza. And none of them are wrong. They're different. And in this case  difference is good  because that's going to increase the chance that we're having a satisfying experience. And lastly  what's the expected outcome of baseball  Well  in baseball  you play to win. You score as many runs as you can. There's always a winner in baseball  and that means there's always a loser in baseball. But what about pizza  Well  in pizza  we're not really    there's no winning. How do you win pizza  You don't. But you do look for   Are we satisfied   And sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days. And we get to decide when we feel satisfied. If we're still hungry  we might have some more. If you eat too much  though  you just feel gross. So what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education  A lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model  and it sets up education that can't help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people. And those young people become older people. But if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza  we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires  to make deliberate decisions about what they want  to talk about it with their partners  and to ultimately look for not some external outcome but for what feels satisfying  and we get to decide that. You may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison  under the baseball  it's all commands. They're all exclamation points. But under the pizza model  they're questions. And who gets to answer those questions  You do. I do. So remember  when we're thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity  baseball  you're out. Pizza is the way to think about healthy  satisfying sexual activity  and good  comprehensive sexuality education. Thank you very much for your time. When I first began recording wild soundscapes    years ago  I had no idea that ants  insect larvae  sea anemones and viruses created a sound signature. But they do. And so does every wild habitat on the planet  like the Amazon rainforest you're hearing behind me. In fact  temperate and tropical rainforests each produce a vibrant animal orchestra  that instantaneous and organized expression of insects  reptiles  amphibians  birds and mammals. And every soundscape that springs from a wild habitat generates its own unique signature  one that contains incredible amounts of information  and it's some of that information I want to share with you today. The soundscape is made up of three basic sources. The first is the geophony  or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat  like wind in the trees  water in a stream  waves at the ocean shore  movement of the Earth. The second of these is the biophony. The biophony is all of the sound that's generated by organisms in a given habitat at one time and in one place. And the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that's called anthrophony. Some of it is controlled  like music or theater  but most of it is chaotic and incoherent  which some of us refer to as noise. There was a time when I considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact. They were just there  but they had no significance. Well  I was wrong. What I learned from these encounters was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life. When I began recording in the late '  s  the typical methods of recording were limited to the fragmented capture of individual species like birds mostly  in the beginning  but later animals like mammals and amphibians. To me  this was a little like trying to understand the magnificence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra and hearing just that one part. Fortunately  more and more institutions are implementing the more holistic models that I and a few of my colleagues have introduced to the field of soundscape ecology. When I began recording over four decades ago  I could record for    hours and capture one hour of usable material  good enough for an album or a film soundtrack or a museum installation. Now  because of global warming  resource extraction  and human noise  among many other factors  it can take up to       hours or more to capture the same thing. Fully    percent of my archive comes from habitats so radically altered that they're either altogether silent or can no longer be heard in any of their original form. The usual methods of evaluating a habitat have been done by visually counting the numbers of species and the numbers of individuals within each species in a given area. However  by comparing data that ties together both density and diversity from what we hear  I'm able to arrive at much more precise fitness outcomes. And I want to show you some examples that typify the possibilities unlocked by diving into this universe. This is Lincoln Meadow. Lincoln Meadow's a three and a half hour drive east of San Francisco in the Sierra Nevada Mountains  at about       meters altitude  and I've been recording there for many years. In       a logging company convinced local residents that there would be absolutely no environmental impact from a new method they were trying called  selective logging   taking out a tree here and there rather than clear cutting a whole area. With permission granted to record both before and after the operation  I set up my gear and captured a large number of dawn choruses to very strict protocol and calibrated recordings  because I wanted a really good baseline. This is an example of a spectrogram. A spectrogram is a graphic illustration of sound with time from left to right across the page       seconds in this case is represented   and frequency from the bottom of the page to the top  lowest to highest. And you can see that the signature of a stream is represented here in the bottom third or half of the page  while birds that were once in that meadow are represented in the signature across the top. There were a lot of them. And here's Lincoln Meadow before selective logging. Well  a year later I returned  and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions  I recorded a number of examples of the same dawn choruses  and now this is what we've got. This is after selective logging. You can see that the stream is still represented in the bottom third of the page  but notice what's missing in the top two thirds. Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker. Well  I've returned to Lincoln Meadow    times in the last    years  and I can tell you that the biophony  the density and diversity of that biophony  has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation. But here's a picture of Lincoln Meadow taken after  and you can see that from the perspective of the camera or the human eye  hardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place  which would confirm the logging company's contention that there's nothing of environmental impact. However  our ears tell us a very different story. Young students are always asking me what these animals are saying  and really I've got no idea. But I can tell you that they do express themselves. Whether or not we understand it is a different story. I was walking along the shore in Alaska  and I came across this tide pool filled with a colony of sea anemones  these wonderful eating machines  relatives of coral and jellyfish. And curious to see if any of them made any noise  I dropped a hydrophone  an underwater microphone covered in rubber  down the mouth part  and immediately the critter began to absorb the microphone into its belly  and the tentacles were searching out of the surface for something of nutritional value. The static like sounds that are very low  that you're going to hear right now. Yeah  but watch. When it didn't find anything to eat    I think that's an expression that can be understood in any language. At the end of its breeding cycle  the Great Basin Spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard panned desert soil of the American West  where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are just right for it to emerge again. And when there's enough moisture in the soil in the spring  frogs will dig themselves to the surface and gather around these large  vernal pools in great numbers. And they vocalize in a chorus that's absolutely in sync with one another. And they do that for two reasons. The first is competitive  because they're looking for mates  and the second is cooperative  because if they're all vocalizing in sync together  it makes it really difficult for predators like coyotes  foxes and owls to single out any individual for a meal. This is a spectrogram of what the frog chorusing looks like when it's in a very healthy pattern. Mono Lake is just to the east of Yosemite National Park in California  and it's a favorite habitat of these toads  and it's also favored by U.S. Navy jet pilots  who train in their fighters flying them at speeds exceeding       kilometers an hour and altitudes only a couple hundred meters above ground level of the Mono Basin  very fast  very low  and so loud that the anthrophony  the human noise  even though it's six and a half kilometers from the frog pond you just heard a second ago  it masked the sound of the chorusing toads. You can see in this spectrogram that all of the energy that was once in the first spectrogram is gone from the top end of the spectrogram  and that there's breaks in the chorusing at two and a half  four and a half  and six and a half seconds  and then the sound of the jet  the signature  is in yellow at the very bottom of the page. Now at the end of that flyby  it took the frogs fully    minutes to regain their chorusing synchronicity  during which time  and under a full moon  we watched as two coyotes and a great horned owl came in to pick off a few of their numbers. The good news is that  with a little bit of habitat restoration and fewer flights  the frog populations  once diminishing during the     s and early '  s  have pretty much returned to normal. I want to end with a story told by a beaver. It's a very sad story  but it really illustrates how animals can sometimes show emotion  a very controversial subject among some older biologists. A colleague of mine was recording in the American Midwest around this pond that had been formed maybe        years ago at the end of the last ice age. It was also formed in part by a beaver dam at one end that held that whole ecosystem together in a very delicate balance. And one afternoon  while he was recording  there suddenly appeared from out of nowhere a couple of game wardens  who for no apparent reason  walked over to the beaver dam  dropped a stick of dynamite down it  blowing it up  killing the female and her young babies. Horrified  my colleagues remained behind to gather his thoughts and to record whatever he could the rest of the afternoon  and that evening  he captured a remarkable event  the lone surviving male beaver swimming in slow circles crying out inconsolably for its lost mate and offspring. This is probably the saddest sound I've ever heard coming from any organism  human or other. Yeah. Well. There are many facets to soundscapes  among them the ways in which animals taught us to dance and sing  which I'll save for another time. But you have heard how biophonies help clarify our understanding of the natural world. You've heard the impact of resource extraction  human noise and habitat destruction. And where environmental sciences have typically tried to understand the world from what we see  a much fuller understanding can be got from what we hear. Biophonies and geophonies are the signature voices of the natural world  and as we hear them  we're endowed with a sense of place  the true story of the world we live in. In a matter of seconds  a soundscape reveals much more information from many perspectives  from quantifiable data to cultural inspiration. Visual capture implicitly frames a limited frontal perspective of a given spatial context  while soundscapes widen that scope to a full     degrees  completely enveloping us. And while a picture may be worth       words  a soundscape is worth       pictures. And our ears tell us that the whisper of every leaf and creature speaks to the natural sources of our lives  which indeed may hold the secrets of love for all things  especially our own humanity  and the last word goes to a jaguar from the Amazon. Thank you for listening. Clouds. Have you ever noticed how much people moan about them  They get a bad rap. If you think about it  the English language has written into it negative associations towards the clouds. Someone who's down or depressed  they're under a cloud. And when there's bad news in store  there's a cloud on the horizon. I saw an article the other day. It was about problems with computer processing over the Internet.  A cloud over the cloud   was the headline. It seems like they're everyone's default doom and gloom metaphor. But I think they're beautiful  don't you  It's just that their beauty is missed because they're so omnipresent  so  I don't know  commonplace  that people don't notice them. They don't notice the beauty  but they don't even notice the clouds unless they get in the way of the sun. And so people think of clouds as things that get in the way. They think of them as the annoying  frustrating obstructions  and then they rush off and do some blue sky thinking. But most people  when you stop to ask them  will admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds. It's like a nostalgic fondness  and they make them think of their youth. Who here can't remember thinking  well  looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids  You know  when you were masters of daydreaming  Aristophanes  the ancient Greek playwright  he described the clouds as the patron godesses of idle fellows two and a half thousand years ago  and you can see what he means. It's just that these days  us adults seem reluctant to allow ourselves the indulgence of just allowing our imaginations to drift along in the breeze  and I think that's a pity. I think we should perhaps do a bit more of it. I think we should be a bit more willing  perhaps  to look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out from behind the clouds and go   Wait a minute  that's two cats dancing the salsa   Or seeing the big  white  puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the Abominable Snowman going to rob a bank. They're like nature's version of those inkblot images  you know  that shrinks used to show their patients in the '  s  and I think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds  you'll save money on psychoanalysis bills. Let's say you're in love. All right  And you look up and what do you see  Right  Or maybe the opposite. You've just been dumped by your partner  and everywhere you look  it's kissing couples. Perhaps you're having a moment of existential angst. You know  you're thinking about your own mortality. And there  on the horizon  it's the Grim Reaper. Or maybe you see a topless sunbather. What would that mean  What would that mean  I have no idea. But one thing I do know is this  The bad press that clouds get is totally unfair. I think we should stand up for them  which is why  a few years ago  I started the Cloud Appreciation Society. Tens of thousands of members now in almost     countries around the world. And all these photographs that I'm showing  they were sent in by members. And the society exists to remind people of this  Clouds are not something to moan about. Far from it. They are  in fact  the most diverse  evocative  poetic aspect of nature. I think  if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then  it helps you keep your feet on the ground. And I want to show you why  with the help of some of my favorite types of clouds. Let's start with this one. It's the cirrus cloud  named after the Latin for a lock of hair. It's composed entirely of ice crystals cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere  and as these ice crystals fall  they pass through different layers with different winds and they speed up and slow down  giving the cloud these brush stroked appearances  these brush stroke forms known as fall streaks. And these winds up there can be very  very fierce. They can be     miles an hour      miles an hour. These clouds are bombing along  but from all the way down here  they appear to be moving gracefully  slowly  like most clouds. And so to tune into the clouds is to slow down  to calm down. It's like a bit of everyday meditation. Those are common clouds. What about rarer ones  like the lenticularis  the UFO shaped lenticularis cloud  These clouds form in the region of mountains. When the wind passes  rises to pass over the mountain  it can take on a wave like path in the lee of the peak  with these clouds hovering at the crest of these invisible standing waves of air  these flying saucer like forms  and some of the early black and white UFO photos are in fact lenticularis clouds. It's true. A little rarer are the fallstreak holes. All right  This is when a layer is made up of very  very cold water droplets  and in one region they start to freeze  and this freezing sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards with the ice crystals cascading and falling down below  giving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below. Rarer still  the Kelvin Helmholtz cloud. Not a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand. This looks like a series of breaking waves  and it's caused by shearing winds    the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly  and in the middle  in between  you get this undulating of the air  and if the difference in those speeds is just right  the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave like vortices. All right. Those are rarer clouds than the cirrus  but they're not that rare. If you look up  and you pay attention to the sky  you'll see them sooner or later  maybe not quite as dramatic as these  but you'll see them. And you'll see them around where you live. Clouds are the most egalitarian of nature's displays  because we all have a good  fantastic view of the sky. And these clouds  these rarer clouds  remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday. Nothing is more nourishing  more stimulating to an active  inquiring mind than being surprised  being amazed. It's why we're all here at TED  right  But you don't need to rush off away from the familiar  across the world to be surprised. You just need to step outside  pay attention to what's so commonplace  so everyday  so mundane that everybody else misses it. One cloud that people rarely miss is this one  the cumulonimbus storm cloud. It's what's produces thunder and lightning and hail. These clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching    miles up into the atmosphere. They are an expression of the majestic architecture of our atmosphere. But from down below  they are the embodiment of the powerful  elemental force and power that drives our atmosphere. To be there is to be connected in the driving rain and the hail  to feel connected to our atmosphere. It's to be reminded that we are creatures that inhabit this ocean of air. We don't live beneath the sky. We live within it. And that connection  that visceral connection to our atmosphere feels to me like an antidote. It's an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life by watching it on a computer screen  you know  when we're in a wi fi zone. But the one cloud that best expresses why cloudspotting is more valuable today than ever is this one  the cumulus cloud. Right  It forms on a sunny day. If you close your eyes and think of a cloud  it's probably one of these that comes to mind. All those cloud shapes at the beginning  those were cumulus clouds. The sharp  crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in. And it reminds us of the aimless nature of cloudspotting  what an aimless activity it is. You're not going to change the world by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky  are you  It's pointless. It's a pointless activity  which is precisely why it's so important. The digital world conspires to make us feel eternally busy  perpetually busy. You know  when you're not dealing with the traditional pressures of earning a living and putting food on the table  raising a family  writing thank you letters  you have to now contend with answering a mountain of unanswered emails  updating a Facebook page  feeding your Twitter feed. And cloudspotting legitimizes doing nothing. And sometimes we need   Sometimes we need excuses to do nothing. We need to be reminded by these patron goddesses of idle fellows that slowing down and being in the present  not thinking about what you've got to do and what you should have done  but just being here  letting your imagination lift from the everyday concerns down here and just being in the present  it's good for you  and it's good for the way you feel. It's good for your ideas. It's good for your creativity. It's good for your soul. So keep looking up  marvel at the ephemeral beauty  and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds. Thank you very much. Where do you come from  It's such a simple question  but these days  of course  simple questions bring ever more complicated answers. People are always asking me where I come from  and they're expecting me to say India  and they're absolutely right insofar as     percent of my blood and ancestry does come from India. Except  I've never lived one day of my life there. I can't speak even one word of its more than        dialects. So I don't think I've really earned the right to call myself an Indian. And if  Where do you come from   means  Where were you born and raised and educated   then I'm entirely of that funny little country known as England  except I left England as soon as I completed my undergraduate education  and all the time I was growing up  I was the only kid in all my classes who didn't begin to look like the classic English heroes represented in our textbooks. And if  Where do you come from   means  Where do you pay your taxes  Where do you see your doctor and your dentist   then I'm very much of the United States  and I have been for    years now  since I was a really small child. Except  for many of those years  I've had to carry around this funny little pink card with green lines running through my face identifying me as a permanent alien. I do actually feel more alien the longer I live there. And if  Where do you come from   means  Which place goes deepest inside you and where do you try to spend most of your time   then I'm Japanese  because I've been living as much as I can for the last    years in Japan. Except  all of those years I've been there on a tourist visa  and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese would want to consider me one of them. And I say all this just to stress how very old fashioned and straightforward my background is  because when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver  most of the kids I meet are much more international and multi cultured than I am. And they have one home associated with their parents  but another associated with their partners  a third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be  a fourth connected with the place they dream of being  and many more besides. And their whole life will be spent taking pieces of many different places and putting them together into a stained glass whole. Home for them is really a work in progress. It's like a project on which they're constantly adding upgrades and improvements and corrections. And for more and more of us  home has really less to do with a piece of soil than  you could say  with a piece of soul. If somebody suddenly asks me   Where's your home   I think about my sweetheart or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be. And I'd always felt this way  but it really came home to me  as it were  some years ago when I was climbing up the stairs in my parents' house in California  and I looked through the living room windows and I saw that we were encircled by    foot flames  one of those wildfires that regularly tear through the hills of California and many other such places. And three hours later  that fire had reduced my home and every last thing in it except for me to ash. And when I woke up the next morning  I was sleeping on a friend's floor  the only thing I had in the world was a toothbrush I had just bought from an all night supermarket. Of course  if anybody asked me then   Where is your home   I literally couldn't point to any physical construction. My home would have to be whatever I carried around inside me. And in so many ways  I think this is a terrific liberation. Because when my grandparents were born  they pretty much had their sense of home  their sense of community  even their sense of enmity  assigned to them at birth  and didn't have much chance of stepping outside of that. And nowadays  at least some of us can choose our sense of home  create our sense of community  fashion our sense of self  and in so doing maybe step a little beyond some of the black and white divisions of our grandparents' age. No coincidence that the president of the strongest nation on Earth is half Kenyan  partly raised in Indonesia  has a Chinese Canadian brother in law. The number of people living in countries not their own now comes to     million  and that's an almost unimaginable number  but it means that if you took the whole population of Canada and the whole population of Australia and then the whole population of Australia again and the whole population of Canada again and doubled that number  you would still have fewer people than belong to this great floating tribe. And the number of us who live outside the old nation state categories is increasing so quickly  by    million just in the last    years  that soon there will be more of us than there are Americans. Already  we represent the fifth largest nation on Earth. And in fact  in Canada's largest city  Toronto  the average resident today is what used to be called a foreigner  somebody born in a very different country. And I've always felt that the beauty of being surrounded by the foreign is that it slaps you awake. You can't take anything for granted. Travel  for me  is a little bit like being in love  because suddenly all your senses are at the setting marked  on.  Suddenly you're alert to the secret patterns of the world. The real voyage of discovery  as Marcel Proust famously said  consists not in seeing new sights  but in looking with new eyes. And of course  once you have new eyes  even the old sights  even your home become something different. Many of the people living in countries not their own are refugees who never wanted to leave home and ache to go back home. But for the fortunate among us  I think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities. Certainly when I'm traveling  especially to the major cities of the world  the typical person I meet today will be  let's say  a half Korean  half German young woman living in Paris. And as soon as she meets a half Thai  half Canadian young guy from Edinburgh  she recognizes him as kin. She realizes that she probably has much more in common with him than with anybody entirely of Korea or entirely of Germany. So they become friends. They fall in love. They move to New York City. Or Edinburgh. And the little girl who arises out of their union will of course be not Korean or German or French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian or even American  but a wonderful and constantly evolving mix of all those places. And potentially  everything about the way that young woman dreams about the world  writes about the world  thinks about the world  could be something different  because it comes out of this almost unprecedented blend of cultures. Where you come from now is much less important than where you're going. More and more of us are rooted in the future or the present tense as much as in the past. And home  we know  is not just the place where you happen to be born. It's the place where you become yourself. And yet  there is one great problem with movement  and that is that it's really hard to get your bearings when you're in midair. Some years ago  I noticed that I had accumulated one million miles on United Airlines alone. You all know that crazy system  six days in hell  you get the seventh day free. And I began to think that really  movement was only as good as the sense of stillness that you could bring to it to put it into perspective. And eight months after my house burned down  I ran into a friend who taught at a local high school  and he said   I've got the perfect place for you.   Really   I said. I'm always a bit skeptical when people say things like that.  No  honestly   he went on   it's only three hours away by car  and it's not very expensive  and it's probably not like anywhere you've stayed before.   Hmm.  I was beginning to get slightly intrigued.  What is it    Well    Here my friend hemmed and hawed    Well  actually it's a Catholic hermitage.  This was the wrong answer. I had spent    years in Anglican schools  so I had had enough hymnals and crosses to last me a lifetime. Several lifetimes  actually. But my friend assured me that he wasn't Catholic  nor were most of his students  but he took his classes there every spring. And as he had it  even the most restless  distractible  testosterone addled    year old Californian boy only had to spend three days in silence and something in him cooled down and cleared out. He found himself. And I thought   Anything that works for a    year old boy ought to work for me.  So I got in my car  and I drove three hours north along the coast  and the roads grew emptier and narrower  and then I turned onto an even narrower path  barely paved  that snaked for two miles up to the top of a mountain. And when I got out of my car  the air was pulsing. The whole place was absolutely silent  but the silence wasn't an absence of noise. It was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening. And at my feet was the great  still blue plate of the Pacific Ocean. All around me were     acres of wild dry brush. And I went down to the room in which I was to be sleeping. Small but eminently comfortable  it had a bed and a rocking chair and a long desk and even longer picture windows looking out on a small  private  walled garden  and then       feet of golden pampas grass running down to the sea. And I sat down  and I began to write  and write  and write  even though I'd gone there really to get away from my desk. And by the time I got up  four hours had passed. Night had fallen  and I went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars  and I could see the tail lights of cars disappearing around the headlands    miles to the south. And it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day vanishing. And the next day  when I woke up in the absence of telephones and TVs and laptops  the days seemed to stretch for a thousand hours. It was really all the freedom I know when I'm traveling  but it also profoundly felt like coming home. And I'm not a religious person  so I didn't go to the services. I didn't consult the monks for guidance. I just took walks along the monastery road and sent postcards to loved ones. I looked at the clouds  and I did what is hardest of all for me to do usually  which is nothing at all. And I started to go back to this place  and I noticed that I was doing my most important work there invisibly just by sitting still  and certainly coming to my most critical decisions the way I never could when I was racing from the last email to the next appointment. And I began to think that something in me had really been crying out for stillness  but of course I couldn't hear it because I was running around so much. I was like some crazy guy who puts on a blindfold and then complains that he can't see a thing. And I thought back to that wonderful phrase I had learned as a boy from Seneca  in which he says   That man is poor not who has little but who hankers after more.  And  of course  I'm not suggesting that anybody here go into a monastery. That's not the point. But I do think it's only by stopping movement that you can see where to go. And it's only by stepping out of your life and the world that you can see what you most deeply care about and find a home. And I've noticed so many people now take conscious measures to sit quietly for    minutes every morning just collecting themselves in one corner of the room without their devices  or go running every evening  or leave their cell phones behind when they go to have a long conversation with a friend. Movement is a fantastic privilege  and it allows us to do so much that our grandparents could never have dreamed of doing. But movement  ultimately  only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to. And home  in the end  is of course not just the place where you sleep. It's the place where you stand. Thank you. Miranda Wang  We're here to talk about accidents. How do you feel about accidents  When we think about accidents  we usually consider them to be harmful  unfortunate or even dangerous  and they certainly can be. But are they always that bad  The discovery that had led to penicillin  for example  is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time. Without biologist Alexander Fleming's moldy accident  caused by a neglected workstation  we wouldn't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections. Jeanny Yao  Miranda and I are here today because we'd like to share how our accidents have led to discoveries. In       we visited the Vancouver Waste Transfer Station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste. We realized that when plastics get to the dump  it's difficult to sort them because they have similar densities  and when they're mixed with organic matter and construction debris  it's truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them. MW  However  plastics are useful because they're durable  flexible  and can be easily molded into so many useful shapes. The downside of this convenience is that there's a high cost to this. Plastics cause serious problems  such as the destruction of ecosystems  the pollution of natural resources  and the reduction of available land space. This picture you see here is the Great Pacific Gyre. When you think about plastic pollution and the marine environment  we think about the Great Pacific Gyre  which is supposed to be a floating island of plastic waste. But that's no longer an accurate depiction of plastic pollution in the marine environment. Right now  the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris  and there's nowhere you can go in the ocean where you wouldn't be able to find plastic particles. JY  In a plastic dependent society  cutting down production is a good goal  but it's not enough. And what about the waste that's already been produced  Plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade. So we thought  you know what  Instead of waiting for that garbage to sit there and pile up  let's find a way to break them down with bacteria. Sounds cool  right  Audience  Yeah. JY  Thank you. But we had a problem. You see  plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade. Anyhow  we were curious and hopeful and still wanted to give it a go. MW  With this idea in mind  Jeanny and I read through some hundreds of scientific articles on the Internet  and we drafted a research proposal in the beginning of our grade    year. We aimed to find bacteria from our local Fraser River that can degrade a harmful plasticizer called phthalates. Phthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexibility  durability and transparency. Although they're part of the plastic  they're not covalently bonded to the plastic backbone. As a result  they easily escape into our environment. Not only do phthalates pollute our environment  but they also pollute our bodies. To make the matter worse  phthalates are found in products to which we have a high exposure  such as babies' toys  beverage containers  cosmetics  and even food wraps. Phthalates are horrible because they're so easily taken into our bodies. They can be absorbed by skin contact  ingested  and inhaled. JY  Every year  at least     million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air  water and soil. The Environmental Protection Agency even classified this group as a top priority pollutant because it's been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor. We read that each year  the Vancouver municipal government monitors phthalate concentration levels in rivers to assess their safety. So we figured  if there are places along our Fraser River that are contaminated with phthalates  and if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas  then perhaps  perhaps these bacteria could have evolved to break down phthalates. MW  So we presented this good idea to Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the University of British Columbia  and surprisingly  he actually took us into his lab and asked his graduate students Adam and James to help us. Little did we know at that time that a trip to the dump and some research on the Internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life changing journey of accidents and discoveries. JY  The first step in our project was to collect soil samples from three different sites along the Fraser River. Out of thousands of bacteria  we wanted to find ones that could break down phthalates  so we enriched our cultures with phthalates as the only carbon source. This implied that  if anything grew in our cultures  then they must be able to live off of phthalates. Everything went well from there  and we became amazing scientists.  Laughter  MW  Um... uh  Jeanny. JY  I'm just joking. MW  Okay. Well  it was partially my fault. You see  I accidentally cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture  and as a result  we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice. And this is only one of the examples of the many accidents that happened during our experimentation. But this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous. We noticed that the unharmed cultures came from places of opposite contamination levels  so this mistake actually led us to think that perhaps we can compare the different degradative potentials of bacteria from sites of opposite contamination levels. JY  Now that we grew the bacteria  we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates  because we thought that would be less accident prone  but we were wrong again. We poked holes in our agar while streaking and contaminated some samples and funghi. As a result  we had to streak and restreak several times. Then we monitored phthalate utilization and bacterial growth  and found that they shared an inverse correlation  so as bacterial populations increased  phthalate concentrations decreased. This means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates. MW  So now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates  we wondered what these bacteria were. So Jeanny and I took three of our most efficient strains and then performed gene amplification sequencing on them and matched our data with an online comprehensive database. We were happy to see that  although our three strains had been previously identified bacteria  two of them were not previously associated with phthalate degradation  so this was actually a novel discovery. JY  To better understand how this biodegradation works  we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways of our three strains. To do this  we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid. MW  We monitored this experiment with spectrophotometry and obtained this beautiful graph. This graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates. Our bacteria can transform phthalates  which is a harmful toxin  into end products such as carbon dioxide  water and alcohol. I know some of you in the crowd are thinking  well  carbon dioxide is horrible  it's a greenhouse gas. But if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates  they would have used some other kind of carbon source  and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway. We were also interested to see that  although we've obtained greater diversity of bacteria biodegraders from the bird habitat site  we obtained the most efficient degraders from the landfill site. So this fully shows that nature evolves through natural selection. JY  So Miranda and I shared this research at the Sanofi BioGENEius Challenge competition and were recognized with the greatest commercialization potential. Although we're not the first ones to find bacteria that can break down phthalates  we were the first ones to look into our local river and find a possible solution to a local problem. We have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution  but also that being open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries. Throughout this journey  we have also discovered our passion for science  and are currently continuing research on other fossil fuel chemicals in university. We hope that in the near future  we'll be able to create model organisms that can break down not only phthalates but a wide variety of different contaminants. We can apply this to wastewater treatment plants to clean up our rivers and other natural resources. And perhaps one day we'll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste. MW  I think our journey has truly transformed our view of microorganisms  and Jeanny and I have shown that even mistakes can lead to discoveries. Einstein once said   You can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking you used when you created them.  If we're making plastic synthetically  then we think the solution would be to break them down biochemically. Thank you. JY  Thank you. My name is Tom  and I've come here today to come clean about what I do for money. Basically  I use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for cash. I usually do this kind of thing in seedy downtown bars and on street corners  so this mightn't be the most appropriate setting  but I'd like to give you guys a bit of a demonstration about what I do. And now  for my next number  I'd like to return to the classics. We're going to take it back  way back  back into time.   Billie Jean is not my lover     She's just a girl who claims that I am the one     But the kid is not my son   Wassup. Thank you very much  TEDx. If you guys haven't figured it out already  my name's Tom Thum  and I'm a beatboxer  which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice  and the only thing was my voice. And I can assure you there are absolutely no effects on this microphone whatsoever. And I'm very  very stoked   You guys are just applauding for everything. It's great. Look at this  Mom  I made it  I'm very  very stoked to be here today  representing my kinfolk and all those that haven't managed to make a career out of an innate ability for inhuman noisemaking. Because it is a bit of a niche market  and there's not much work going on  especially where I'm from. You know  I'm from Brisbane  which is a great city to live in. Yeah  All right  Most of Brisbane's here. That's good. You know  I'm from Brizzy  which is a great city to live in  but let's be honest    it's not exactly the cultural hub of the Southern Hemisphere. So I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane and outside Australia  and so the pursuit of this crazy passion of mine has enabled me to see so many amazing places in the world. So I'd like to share with you  if I may  my experiences. So ladies and gentlemen  I would like to take you on a journey throughout the continents and throughout sound itself. We start our journey in the central deserts. India. China. Germany. Party  party  yeah. And before we reach our final destination  ladies and gentlemen  I would like to share with you some technology that I brought all the way from the thriving metropolis of Brisbane. These things in front of me here are called Kaoss Pads  and they allow me to do a whole lot of different things with my voice. For example  the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound  which gives me that    flavor. And the other ones here  I can use them in unison to mimic the effect of a drum machine or something like that. I can sample in my own sounds and I can play it back just by hitting the pads here. TEDx. I got way too much time on my hands. And last but not least  the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice. So with all that in mind  ladies and gentlemen  I would like to take you on a journey to a completely separate part of Earth as I transform the Sydney Opera House into a smoky downtown jazz bar. All right boys  take it away. Ladies and gentlemen  I'd like to introduce you to a very special friend of mine  one of the greatest double bassists I know. Mr. Smokey Jefferson  let's take it for a walk. Come on  baby. All right  ladies and gentlemen  I'd like to introduce you to the star of the show  one of the greatest jazz legends of our time. Music lovers and jazz lovers alike  please give a warm hand of applause for the one and only Mr. Peeping Tom. Take it away. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk about consciousness. Why consciousness  Well  it's a curiously neglected subject  both in our scientific and our philosophical culture. Now why is that curious  Well  it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple  logical reason  namely  it's a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we're conscious. You care about science  philosophy  music  art  whatever    it's no good if you're a zombie or in a coma  right  So consciousness is number one. The second reason is that when people do get interested in it  as I think they should  they tend to say the most appalling things. And then  even when they're not saying appalling things and they're really trying to do serious research  well  it's been slow. Progress has been slow. When I first got interested in this  I thought  well  it's a straightforward problem in biology. Let's get these brain stabbers to get busy and figure out how it works in the brain. So I went over to UCSF and I talked to all the heavy duty neurobiologists there  and they showed some impatience  as scientists often do when you ask them embarrassing questions. But the thing that struck me is  one guy said in exasperation  a very famous neurobiologist  he said   Look  in my discipline it's okay to be interested in consciousness  but get tenure first. Get tenure first.  Now I've been working on this for a long time. I think now you might actually get tenure by working on consciousness. If so  that's a real step forward. Okay  now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness  Well  I think it's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions. One feature is the tradition of religious dualism  Consciousness is not a part of the physical world. It's a part of the spiritual world. It belongs to the soul  and the soul is not a part of the physical world. That's the tradition of God  the soul and immortality. There's another tradition that thinks it's opposed to this but accepts the worst assumption. That tradition thinks that we are heavy duty scientific materialists  Consciousness is not a part of the physical world. Either it doesn't exist at all  or it's something else  a computer program or some damn fool thing  but in any case it's not part of science. And I used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache. Here's how it went. Science is objective  consciousness is subjective  therefore there cannot be a science of consciousness. Okay  so these twin traditions are paralyzing us. It's very hard to get out of these twin traditions. And I have only one real message in this lecture  and that is  consciousness is a biological phenomenon like photosynthesis  digestion  mitosis    you know all the biological phenomena    and once you accept that  most  though not all  of the hard problems about consciousness simply evaporate. And I'm going to go through some of them. Okay  now I promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness. One  Consciousness does not exist. It's an illusion  like sunsets. Science has shown sunsets and rainbows are illusions. So consciousness is an illusion. Two  Well  maybe it exists  but it's really something else. It's a computer program running in the brain. Three  No  the only thing that exists is really behavior. It's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was  but I'll get back to that. And four  Maybe consciousness exists  but it can't make any difference to the world. How could spirituality move anything  Now  whenever somebody tells me that  I think  you want to see spirituality move something  Watch. I decide consciously to raise my arm  and the damn thing goes up.  Laughter  Furthermore  notice this  We do not say   Well  it's a bit like the weather in Geneva. Some days it goes up and some days it doesn't go up.  No. It goes up whenever I damn well want it to. Okay. I'm going to tell you how that's possible. Now  I haven't yet given you a definition. You can't do this if you don't give a definition. People always say consciousness is very hard to define. I think it's rather easy to define if you're not trying to give a scientific definition. We're not ready for a scientific definition  but here's a common sense definition. Consciousness consists of all those states of feeling or sentience or awareness. It begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep  and it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious. Dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition. Now  that's the common sense definition. That's our target. If you're not talking about that  you're not talking about consciousness. But they think   Well  if that's it  that's an awful problem. How can such a thing exist as part of the real world   And this  if you've ever had a philosophy course  this is known as the famous mind body problem. I think that has a simple solution too. I'm going to give it to you. And here it is  All of our conscious states  without exception  are caused by lower level neurobiological processes in the brain  and they are realized in the brain as higher level or system features. It's about as mysterious as the liquidity of water. Right  The liquidity is not an extra juice squirted out by the H O molecules. It's a condition that the system is in. And just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules  so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious  depending on the behavior of the molecules. The famous mind body problem is that simple. All right  But now we get into some harder questions. Let's specify the exact features of consciousness  so that we can then answer those four objections that I made to it. Well  the first feature is  it's real and irreducible. You can't get rid of it. You see  the distinction between reality and illusion is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are. It consciously seems like there's    I like the French  arc en ciel    it seems like there's an arch in the sky  or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains. It consciously seems to us  but that's not really happening. But for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are  you can't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness  because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned  if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious  you are conscious. I mean  if a bunch of experts come to me and say   We are heavy duty neurobiologists and we've done a study of you  Searle  and we're convinced you are not conscious  you are a very cleverly constructed robot   I don't think   Well  maybe these guys are right  you know   I don't think that for a moment  because  I mean  Descartes may have made a lot of mistakes  but he was right about this. You cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness. Okay  that's the first feature of consciousness. It's real and irreducible. You cannot get rid of it by showing that it's an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions. Okay  the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us  and that is  all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them. There's something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income tax or listen to music  and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature  namely  conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject  some self that experiences them. Maybe we'll be able to build a conscious machine. Since we don't know how our brains do it  we're not in a position  so far  to build a conscious machine. Okay. Another feature of consciousness is that it comes in unified conscious fields. So I don't just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes against the floor  but they occur to me as part of one single great conscious field that stretches forward and backward. That is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness. And we have not been able to do that in a robot. The disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don't know how to make a conscious robot  so we don't have a machine that can do this kind of thing. Okay  the next feature of consciousness  after this marvelous unified conscious field  is that it functions causally in our behavior. I gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand  but how is that possible  How can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects  Well  I'll tell you the answer. I mean  we don't know the detailed answer  but we know the basic part of the answer  and that is  there is a sequence of neuron firings  and they terminate where the acetylcholine is secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons. Sorry to use philosophical terminology here  but when it's secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons  a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up. Now  think of what I told you. One and the same event  my conscious decision to raise my arm has a level of description where it has all of these touchy feely spiritual qualities. It's a thought in my brain  but at the same time  it's busy secreting acetylcholine and doing all sorts of other things as it makes its way from the motor cortex down through the nerve fibers in the arm. Now  what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are totally obsolete. One and the same event has a level of description where it's neurobiological  and another level of description where it's mental  and that's a single event  and that's how nature works. That's how it's possible for consciousness to function causally. Okay  now with that in mind  with going through these various features of consciousness  let's go back and answer some of those early objections. Well  the first one I said was  consciousness doesn't exist  it's an illusion. Well  I've already answered that. I don't think we need to worry about that. But the second one had an incredible influence  and may still be around  and that is   Well  if consciousness exists  it's really something else. It's really a digital computer program running in your brain and that's what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program. Yeah  forget about the hardware. Any hardware will do provided it's rich enough and stable enough to carry the program.  Now  we know that that's wrong. I mean  anybody who's thought about computers at all can see that that's wrong  because computation is defined as symbol manipulation  usually thought of as zeros as ones  but any symbols will do. You get an algorithm that you can program in a binary code  and that's the defining trait of the computer program. But we know that that's purely syntactical. That's symbolic. We know that actual human consciousness has something more than that. It's got a content in addition to the syntax. It's got a semantics. Now that argument  I made that argument       oh my God  I don't want to think about it   more than    years ago  but there's a deeper argument implicit in what I've told you  and I want to tell you that argument briefly  and that is  consciousness creates an observer independent reality. It creates a reality of money  property  government  marriage  CERN conferences  cocktail parties and summer vacations  and all of those are creations of consciousness. Their existence is observer relative. It's only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university. Now  ask yourself about computation. Is that absolute  like force and mass and gravitational attraction  Or is it observer relative  Well  some computations are intrinsic. I add two plus two to get four. That's going on no matter what anybody thinks. But when I haul out my pocket calculator and do the calculation  the only intrinsic phenomenon is the electronic circuit and its behavior. That's the only absolute phenomenon. All the rest is interpreted by us. Computation only exists relative to consciousness. Either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation  or he's got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation. Now that doesn't mean computation is arbitrary. I spent a lot of money on this hardware. But we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims. And the bottom line of this part of my talk is this  You can have a completely objective science  a science where you make objectively true claims  about a domain whose existence is subjective  whose existence is in the human brain consisting of subjective states of sentience or feeling or awareness. So the objection that you can't have an objective science of consciousness because it's subjective and science is objective  that's a pun. That's a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity. You can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence  and indeed that's what neurologists do. I mean  you have patients that actually suffer pains  and you try to get an objective science of that. Okay  I promised to refute all these guys  and I don't have an awful lot of time left  but let me refute a couple more of them. I said that behaviorism ought to be one of the great embarrassments of our intellectual culture  because it's refuted the moment you think about it. Your mental states are identical with your behavior  Well  think about the distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior. I won't demonstrate pain behavior  but I can tell you I'm not having any pains right now. So it's an obvious mistake. Why did they make the mistake  The mistake was   and you can go back and read the literature on this  you can see this over and over   they think if you accept the irreducible existence of consciousness  you're giving up on science. You're giving up on     years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it. And the message I want to leave you with is  consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological phenomenon  as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology  or  for that matter  the rest of science. Thank you very much. I love paper  and I love technology  and what I do is I make paper interactive. And that's what I say when people ask me what I do  but it really confuses most people  so really  the best way for me to convey it is to take the technology and be creative and create experiences. So I tried to think what I could use for here  and a couple of weeks ago I had a crazy idea that I wanted to print two DJ decks and to try and mix some music. And I'm going to try and show that at the end  and the suspense will be as much mine if it works. And I'm not a DJ  and I'm not a musician  so I'm a little bit scared of that. So I think  I found the best way to describe my journey is just to mention a few little things that have happened to me throughout my life. There's three particular things that I've done  and I'll just describe those first  and then talk about some of my work. So when I was a kid  I was obsessed with wires  and I used to thread them under my carpet and thread them behind the walls and have little switches and little speakers  and I wanted to make my bedroom be interactive but kind of all hidden away. And I was also really interested in wireless as well. So I bought one of those little kits that you could get to make a radio transmitter  and I got an old book and I carved out the inside and I hid it inside there  and then I placed it next to my dad and snuck back to my bedroom and tuned in on the radio so I could eavesdrop. I was not at all interested in what he was saying. It's more that I just liked the idea of an everyday object having something inside and doing something different. Several year later  I managed to successfully fail all of my exams and didn't really leave school with much to show for at all  and my parents  maybe as a reward  bought me what turned out to be a one way ticket to Australia  and I came back home about four years later. I ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere. It was in far western New South Wales. And this farm was         acres. There were        sheep  and it was about    degrees  or     or so Fahrenheit. And on this farm there was the farmer  his wife  and there was the four year old daughter. And they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work. Obviously  one of the most important things was the sheep  and so my job was  well  pretty much to do everything  but it was about bringing the sheep back to the homestead. And we'd do that by building fences  using motorbikes and horses  and the sheep would make their way all the way back to the shearing shed for the different seasons. And what I learned was  although at the time  like everyone else  I thought sheep were pretty stupid because they didn't do what we wanted them to do  what I realize now  probably only just in the last few weeks looking back  is the sheep weren't stupid at all. We'd put them in an environment where they didn't want to be  and they didn't want to do what we wanted them to do. So the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by listening to the weather  the lay of the land  and creating things that would let the sheep flow and go where we wanted them to go. Another bunch of years later  I ended up at Cambridge University at the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K. doing a Ph.D. in physics. My Ph.D. was to move electrons around  one at a time. And I realize   again  it's kind of these realizations looking back as to what I did   I realize now that it was pretty much the same as moving sheep around. It really is. It's just you do it by changing an environment. And that's kind of been a big lesson to me  that you can't act on any object. You change its environment  and the object will flow. So we made it very small  so things were about    nanometers in size  making it very cold  so at liquid helium temperatures  and changing environment by changing the voltage  and the electrons could make flow around a loop one at a time  on and off  a little memory node. And I wanted to go one step further  and I wanted to move one electron on and one electron off. And I was told that I wouldn't be able to do this  which  you know  as we've heard from other people  that's the thing that makes you do it. And I was determined  and I managed to show that I could do that. And a lot of that learning  I think  came from being on that farm  because when I was working on the farm  we'd have to use what was around us  we'd have to use the environment  and there was no such thing as something can't be done  because you're in an environment where  if you can't do what you need to do  you can die  and  you know  I had seen that sort of thing happen. So now my obsession is printing  and I'm really fascinated by the idea of using conventional printing processes  so the types of print that are used to create many of the things around us to make paper and card interactive. When I spoke to some printers when I started doing this and told them what I wanted to do  which was to print conductive inks onto paper  they told me it couldn't be done  again  that kind of favorite thing. So I got about    credit cards and loans and got myself very close to bankruptcy  really  and bought myself this huge printing press  which I had no idea how to use at all. It was about five meters long  and I covered myself and the floor with ink and made a massive mess  but I learned to print. And then I took it back to the printers and showed them what I've done  and they were like   Of course you can do that. Why didn't you come here in the first place   That's always the case. So what we do is we take conventional printing presses  we make conductive inks  and run those through a press  and basically just letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow through pieces of paper so we can make that paper interactive. And it's pretty simple  really. It's just a collection of things that have been done before  but bringing them together in a different way. So we have a piece of paper with conductive ink on  and then add onto that a small circuit board with a couple of chips  one to run some capacitive touch software  so we know where we've touched it  and the other to run  quite often  some wireless software so the piece of paper can connect. So I'll just describe a couple of things that we've created. There's lots of different things we've created. This is one of them  because I love cake. And this one  it's a large poster  and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it  and the poster talks to you when you touch it and asks you a series of questions  and it works out your perfect cake. But it doesn't tell you the cake there and then. It uploads a picture  and the reason why it chose that cake for you  to our Facebook page and to Twitter. So we're trying to create that connection between the physical and the digital  but have it not looking on a screen  and just looking like a regular poster. We've worked with a bunch of universities on a project looking at interactive newsprint. So for example  we've created a newspaper  a regular newspaper. You can wear a pair of headphones that are connected to it wirelessly  and when you touch it  you can hear the music that's described on the top  which is something you can't read. You can hear a press conference as well as reading what the editor has determined that press conference was about. And you can press a Facebook  like  button or you can vote on something as well. Something else that we created  and this was an idea that I had a couple of years ago  and so we've done a project on this. It was for funding from the government for user centered design for energy efficient buildings  difficult to say  and something I had no idea what it was when I went into the workshop  but quickly learned. And we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better. And I really liked the idea that  instead of looking at dials and reading things to say    looking at your energy usage  I wanted to create a poster that was wirelessly connected and had color changing inks on it  and so if your energy usage was trending better  than the leaves would appear and the rabbits would appear and all would be good. And if it wasn't  then there'd be graffiti and the leaves would fall off the trees. So it was trying to make you look after something in your immediate environment  which you don't want to see not looking so good  rather than expecting people to do things in the local environment because of the effect that it has a long way off. And I think  kind of like going back to the farm  it's about how to let people do what you want them to do rather than making people do what you want them to do. Okay. So this is the bit I'm really scared of. So a couple of things I've created are  there's a poster over here that you can play drums on. And I am not a musician. It seemed like a good idea at the time. If anyone wants to try and play drums  then they can. I'll just describe how this works. This poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone  and when you touch it  it connects to the app. And it has really good response time. It's using Bluetooth    so it's pretty instantaneous. Okay. Thanks. And there's a couple of other things. So this one is like a sound board  so you can touch it  and I just love these horrible noises. Okay  and this is a D.J. turntable. So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad  and this is a software that's running on the iPad. Oh  yes. I just love doing that. I'm not a D.J.  though  but I just always wanted to do that. So I have a crossfader  and I have the two decks. So I've made some new technology  and I love things being creative  and I love working with creative people. So my    year old niece  she's amazing  and she's called Charlotte  and I asked her to record something  and I worked with a friend called Elliot to put some beats together. So this is my niece  Charlotte. Yay  So that's pretty much what I do. I just love bringing technology together  having a lot of fun  being creative. But it's not about the technology. It's just about  I want to create some great experiences. So thank you very much. Francesca Fedeli  Ciao. So he's Mario. He's our son. He was born two and a half years ago  and I had a pretty tough pregnancy because I had to stay still in a bed for  like  eight months. But in the end everything seemed to be under control. So he got the right weight at birth. He got the right Apgar index. So we were pretty reassured by this. But at the end     days later after he was born  we discovered that he had a stroke. As you might know  a stroke is a brain injury. A perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth  and in his case  as you can see  the right part of his brain has gone. So the effect that this stroke could have on Mario's body could be the fact that he couldn't be able to control the left side of his body. Just imagine  if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit  to input to print out a document  but the printer doesn't have the right drives  so the same is for Mario. It's just like  he would like to move his left side of his body  but he's not able to transmit the right input to move his left arm and left leg. So life had to change. We needed to change our schedule. We needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life. Roberto D'Angelo  As you may imagine  unfortunately  we were not ready. Nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities  and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds. And that has been really a tough time. Questions  some basics  like  you know  why did this happen to us  And what went wrong  Some more tough  like  really  what will be the impact on Mario's life  I mean  at the end  will he be able to work  Will he be able to be normal  And  you know  as a parent  especially for the first time  why is he not going to be better than us  And this  indeed  really is tough to say  but a few months later  we realized that we were really feeling like a failure. I mean  the only real product of our life  at the end  was a failure. And you know  it was not a failure for ourselves in itself  but it was a failure that will impact his full life. Honestly  we went down. I mean we went really down  but at the end  we started to look at him  and we said  we have to react. So immediately  as Francesca said  we changed our life. We started physiotherapy  we started the rehabilitation  and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot. Basically  we spent months doing this with Mario. You have an object  and we showed him how to grab the object. Now  the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains  exactly now  as you watch me doing this  you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions. It looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation. But one day we found that Mario was not looking at our hand. He was looking at us. We were his mirror. And the problem  as you might feel  is that we were down  we were depressed  we were looking at him as a problem  not as a son  not from a positive perspective. And that day really changed our perspective. We realized that we had to become a better mirror for Mario. We restarted from our strengths  and at the same time we restarted from his strengths. We stopped looking at him as a problem  and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve. And really  this was the change  and from our side  we said   What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario   And we started from our passions. I mean  at the end  my wife and myself are quite different  but we have many things in common. We love to travel  we love music  we love to be in places like this  and we started to bring Mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him. This short video is from last week. I am not saying    I am not saying it's a miracle. That's not the message  because we are just at the beginning of the path. But we want to share what was the key learning  the key learning that Mario drove to us  and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss  and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity. And this is the message that we want to share with you. This is why we are here. Mario  And this is why    And this is why we decided to share the best mirror in the world with him. And we thank you so much  all of you. FF  Thank you. RD  Thank you. Bye. FF  Thank you.  Applause  So if I was to ask you what the connection between a bottle of Tide detergent and sweat was  you'd probably think that's the easiest question that you're going to be asked in Edinburgh all week. But if I was to say that they're both examples of alternative or new forms of currency in a hyperconnected  data driven global economy  you'd probably think I was a little bit bonkers. But trust me  I work in advertising. And I am going to tell you the answer  but obviously after this short break. So a more challenging question is one that I was asked  actually  by one of our writers a couple of weeks ago  and I didn't know the answer  What's the world's best performing currency  It's actually Bitcoin. Now  for those of you who may not be familiar  Bitcoin is a crypto currency  a virtual currency  synthetic currency. It was founded in      by this anonymous programmer using a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. No one knows who or what he is. He's almost like the Banksy of the Internet. And I'm probably not going to do it proper service here  but my interpretation of how it works is that Bitcoins are released through this process of mining. So there's a network of computers that are challenged to solve a very complex mathematical problem and the person that manages to solve it first gets the Bitcoins. And the Bitcoins are released  they're put into a public ledger called the Blockchain  and then they float  so they become a currency  and completely decentralized  that's the sort of scary thing about this  which is why it's so popular. So it's not run by the authorities or the state. It's actually managed by the network. And the reason that it's proved very successful is it's private  it's anonymous  it's fast  and it's cheap. And you do get to the point where there's some wild fluctuations with Bitcoin. So in one level it went from something like    dollars to      literally in the space of four months  and then crashed and lost half of its value in six hours. And it's currently around that kind of     dollar mark in value. But what it does show is that it's sort of gaining ground  it's gaining respectability. You get services  like Reddit and Wordpress are actually accepting Bitcoin as a payment currency now. And that's showing you that people are actually placing trust in technology  and it's started to trump and disrupt and interrogate traditional institutions and how we think about currencies and money. And that's not surprising  if you think about the basket case that is the E.U. I think there was a Gallup survey out recently that said something like  in America  trust in banks is at an all time low  it's something like    percent. And you can see here some photographs from London where Barclays sponsored the city bike scheme  and some activists have done some nice piece of guerrilla marketing here and doctored the slogans.  Sub prime pedaling.   Barclays takes you for a ride.  These are the more polite ones I could share with you today. But you get the gist  so people have really started to sort of lose faith in institutions. There's a P.R. company called Edelman  they do this very interesting survey every year precisely around trust and what people are thinking. And this is a global survey  so these numbers are global. And what's interesting is that you can see that hierarchy is having a bit of a wobble  and it's all about heterarchical now  so people trust people like themselves more than they trust corporations and governments. And if you look at these figures for the more developed markets like U.K.  Germany  and so on  they're actually much lower. And I find that sort of scary. People are actually trusting businesspeople more than they're trusting governments and leaders. So what's starting to happen  if you think about money  if you sort of boil money down to an essence  it is literally just an expression of value  an agreed value. So what's happening now  in the digital age  is that we can quantify value in lots of different ways and do it more easily  and sometimes the way that we quantify those values  it makes it much easier to create new forms and valid forms of currency. In that context  you can see that networks like Bitcoin suddenly start to make a bit more sense. So if you think we're starting to question and disrupt and interrogate what money means  what our relationship with it is  what defines money  then the ultimate extension of that is  is there a reason for the government to be in charge of money anymore  So obviously I'm looking at this through a marketing prism  so from a brand perspective  brands literally stand or fall on their reputations. And if you think about it  reputation has now become a currency. You know  reputations are built on trust  consistency  transparency. So if you've actually decided that you trust a brand  you want a relationship  you want to engage with the brand  you're already kind of participating in lots of new forms of currency. So you think about loyalty. Loyalty essentially is a micro economy. You think about rewards schemes  air miles. The Economist said a few years ago that there are actually more unredeemed air miles in the world than there are dollar bills in circulation. You know  when you are standing in line in Starbucks     percent of transactions in Starbucks on any one day are actually being made with Starbucks Star points. So that's a sort of Starbucks currency staying within its ecosystem. And what I find interesting is that Amazon has recently launched Amazon coins. So admittedly it's a currency at the moment that's purely for the Kindle. So you can buy apps and make purchases within those apps  but you think about Amazon  you look at the trust barometer that I showed you where people are starting to trust businesses  especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments. So suddenly  you start thinking  well Amazon potentially could push this. It could become a natural extension  that as well as buying stuff    take it out of the Kindle    you could buy books  music  real life products  appliances and goods and so on. And suddenly you're getting Amazon  as a brand  is going head to head with the Federal Reserve in terms of how you want to spend your money  what money is  what constitutes money. And I'll get you back to Tide  the detergent now  as I promised. This is a fantastic article I came across in New York Magazine  where it was saying that drug users across America are actually purchasing drugs with bottles of Tide detergent. So they're going into convenience stores  stealing Tide  and a     bottle of Tide is equal to    dollars of crack cocaine or weed. And what they're saying  so some criminologists have looked at this and they're saying  well  okay  Tide as a product sells at a premium. It's    percent above the category average. It's infused with a very complex cocktail of chemicals  so it smells very luxurious and very distinctive  and  being a Procter and Gamble brand  it's been supported by a lot of mass media advertising. So what they're saying is that drug users are consumers too  so they have this in their neural pathways. When they spot Tide  there's a shortcut. They say  that is trust. I trust that. That's quality. So it becomes this unit of currency  which the New York Magazine described as a very oddly loyal crime wave  brand loyal crime wave  and criminals are actually calling Tide  liquid gold.  Now  what I thought was funny was the reaction from the P G spokesperson. They said  obviously tried to dissociate themselves from drugs  but said   It reminds me of one thing and that's the value of the brand has stayed consistent.   Laughter  Which backs up my point and shows he didn't even break a sweat when he said that. So that brings me back to the connection with sweat. In Mexico  Nike has run a campaign recently called  literally  Bid Your Sweat. So you think about  these Nike shoes have got sensors in them  or you're using a Nike FuelBand that basically tracks your movement  your energy  your calorie consumption. And what's happening here  this is where you've actually elected to join that Nike community. You've bought into it. They're not advertising loud messages at you  and that's where advertising has started to shift now is into things like services  tools and applications. So Nike is literally acting as a well being partner  a health and fitness partner and service provider. So what happens with this is they're saying   Right  you have a data dashboard. We know how far you've run  how far you've moved  what your calorie intake  all that sort of stuff. What you can do is  the more you run  the more points you get  and we have an auction where you can buy Nike stuff but only by proving that you've actually used the product to do stuff.  And you can't come into this. This is purely for the community that are sweating using Nike products. You can't buy stuff with pesos. This is literally a closed environment  a closed auction space. In Africa  you know  airtime has become literally a currency in its own right. People are used to  because mobile is king  they're very  very used to transferring money  making payments via mobile. And one of my favorite examples from a brand perspective going on is Vodafone  where  in Egypt  lots of people make purchases in markets and very small independent stores. Loose change  small change is a real problem  and what tends to happen is you buy a bunch of stuff  you're due  say     cents     cents in change. The shopkeepers tend to give you things like an onion or an aspirin  or a piece of gum  because they don't have small change. So when Vodafone came in and saw this problem  this consumer pain point  they created some small change which they call Fakka  which literally sits and is given by the shopkeepers to people  and it's credit that goes straight onto their mobile phone. So this currency becomes credit  which again  is really  really interesting. And we did a survey that backs up the fact that  you know     percent of people in this very crucial demographic in the U.S. were saying that they're comfortable using an independent or branded currency. So that's getting really interesting here  a really interesting dynamic going on. And you think  corporations should start taking their assets and thinking of them in a different way and trading them. And you think  is it much of a leap  It seems farfetched  but when you think about it  in America in       there were       corporations issuing banknotes. There were       kinds of notes in America. And the only thing that stopped that  the government controlled four percent of the supply  and the only thing that stopped it was the Civil War breaking out  and the government suddenly wanted to take control of the money. So government  money  war  nothing changes there  then. So what I'm going to ask is  basically  is history repeating itself  Is technology making paper money feel outmoded  Are we decoupling money from the government  You know  you think about  brands are starting to fill the gaps. Corporations are filling gaps that governments can't afford to fill. So I think  you know  will we be standing on stage buying a coffee    organic  fair trade coffee    next year using TED florins or TED shillings  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  I'm five years old  and I am very proud. My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine. Inside  it's a smelly  gaping hole in the ground  but outside  it's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun. This makes me feel so proud  so important  that I appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and I devise missions for us. So we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free. Four years earlier  when I was one  after the Chernobyl accident  the rain came down black  and my sister's hair fell out in clumps  and I spent nine months in the hospital. There were no visitors allowed  so my mother bribed a hospital worker. She acquired a nurse's uniform  and she snuck in every night to sit by my side. Five years later  an unexpected silver lining. Thanks to Chernobyl  we get asylum in the U.S. I am six years old  and I don't cry when we leave home and we come to America  because I expect it to be a place filled with rare and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate and Bazooka bubble gum  Bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside  Bazooka that we'd get once a year in Ukraine and we'd have to chew one piece for an entire week. So the first day we get to New York  my grandmother and I find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family's staying in. Only  we don't know that it's a homeless shelter. We think that it's a hotel  a hotel with lots of rats. So we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor  and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don't just lose money. And I hold this penny in the palm of my hand  and it's sticky and rusty  but it feels like I'm holding a fortune. I decide that I'm going to get my very own piece of Bazooka bubble gum. And in that moment  I feel like a millionaire. About a year later  I get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash  and suddenly I have more toys than I've ever had in my whole life. And again  I get that feeling when we get a knock on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn  and my sister and I find a deliveryman with a box of pizza that we didn't order. So we take the pizza  our very first pizza  and we devour slice after slice as the deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway. And he tells us to pay  but we don't speak English. My mother comes out  and he asks her for money  but she doesn't have enough. She walks    blocks to and from work every day just to avoid spending money on bus fare. Then our neighbor pops her head in  and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza. Everyone's upset. But the pizza is delicious. It doesn't hit me until years later just how little we had. On our    year anniversary of being in the U.S.  we decided to celebrate by reserving a room at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the U.S. The man at the front desk laughs  and he says   You can't reserve a room here. This is a homeless shelter.  And we were shocked. My husband Brian was also homeless as a kid. His family lost everything  and at age     he had to live in motels with his dad  motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill. And one time  when he finally got his box of Frosted Flakes back  it was crawling with roaches. But he did have one thing. He had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books  two G.I. Joes painted to look like Spider Man and five Gobots. And this was his treasure. This was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams. I'm going to tell you about one more formerly homeless member of our family. This is Scarlett. Once upon a time  Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights. She was tied up and thrown into the ring for other dogs to attack so they'd get more aggressive before the fight. And now  these days  she eats organic food and she sleeps on an orthopedic bed with her name on it  but when we pour water for her in her bowl  she still looks up and she wags her tail in gratitude. Sometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett  and she rolls through the grass  and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude. We forget about all of our new middle class frustrations and disappointments  and we feel like millionaires. Thank you. What do we know about the future  Difficult question  simple answer  nothing. We cannot predict the future. We only can create a vision of the future  how it might be  a vision which reveals disruptive ideas  which is inspiring  and this is the most important reason which breaks the chains of common thinking. There are a lot of people who created their own vision about the future  for instance  this vision here from the early   th century. It says here that this is the ocean plane of the future. It takes only one and a half days to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Today  we know that this future vision didn't come true. So this is our largest airplane which we have  the Airbus A     and it's quite huge  so a lot of people fit in there and it's technically completely different than the vision I've shown to you. I'm working in a team with Airbus  and we have created our vision about a more sustainable future of aviation. So sustainability is quite important for us  which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values. So we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone  or a skeleton  which occurs in nature. So that's why it looks maybe a little bit weird  especially to the people who deal with structures in general. But at least it's just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future. What are the main customers of the future  So  we have the old  we have the young  we have the uprising power of women  and there's one mega trend which affects all of us. These are the future anthropometrics. So our children are getting larger  but at the same time we are growing into different directions. So what we need is space inside the aircraft  inside a very dense area. These people have different needs. So we see a clear need of active health promotion  especially in the case of the old people. We want to be treated as individuals. We like to be productive throughout the entire travel chain  and what we are doing in the future is we want to use the latest man machine interface  and we want to integrate this and show this in one product. So we combined these needs with technology's themes. So for instance  we are asking ourselves  how can we create more light  How can we bring more natural light into the airplane  So this airplane has no windows anymore  for example. What about the data and communication software which we need in the future  My belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness. It will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology. This will be very different in the future. It will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment. And then we are talking also about materials  synthetic biology  for example. And my belief is that we will get more and more new materials which we can put into structure later on  because structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design. So let's compare the old world with the new world. I just want to show you here what we are doing today. So this is a bracket of an A    crew rest compartment. It takes a lot of weight  and it follows the classical design rules. This here is an equal bracket for the same purpose. It follows the design of bone. The design process is completely different. At the one hand  we have  .  kilos  and at the other hand  .  kilos. So this technology   D printing  and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight  which is the biggest issue in aircraft design  because it's directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions. Push this idea a little bit forward. So how does nature build its components and structures  So nature is very clever. It puts all the information into these small building blocks  which we call DNA. And nature builds large skeletons out of it. So we see a bottom up approach here  because all the information  as I said  are inside the DNA. And this is combined with a top down approach  because what we are doing in our daily life is we train our muscles  we train our skeleton  and it's getting stronger. And the same approach can be applied to technology as well. So our building block is carbon nanotubes  for example  to create a large  rivet less skeleton at the end of the day. How this looks in particular  you can show it here. So imagine you have carbon nanotubes growing inside a  D printer  and they are embedded inside a matrix of plastic  and follow the forces which occur in your component. And you've got trillions of them. So you really align them to wood  and you take this wood and make morphological optimization  so you make structures  sub structures  which allows you to transmit electrical energy or data. And now we take this material  combine this with a top down approach  and build bigger and bigger components. So how might the airplane of the future look  So we have very different seats which adapt to the shape of the future passenger  with the different anthropometrics. We have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf. And finally  this bionic structure  which is covered by a transparent biopolymer membrane  will really change radically how we look at aircrafts in the future. So as Jason Silva said  if we can imagine it  why not make it so  See you in the future. Thank you. This is an ambucycle. This is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency. It has everything an ambulance has except for a bed. You see the defibrillator. You see the equipment. We all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston. When I was looking at these pictures  it brought me back many years to my past when I was a child. I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem. When I was six years old  I was walking back from school on a Friday afternoon with my older brother. We were passing by a bus stop. We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes. The bus was on fire  and many people were hurt and killed. I remembered an old man yelling to us and crying to help us get him up. He just needed someone helping him. We were so scared and we just ran away. Growing up  I decided I wanted to become a doctor and save lives. Maybe that was because of what I saw when I was a child. When I was     I took an EMT course  and I went to volunteer on an ambulance. For two years  I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem. I helped many people  but whenever someone really needed help  I never got there in time. We never got there. The traffic is so bad. The distance  and everything. We never got there when somebody really needed us. One day  we received a call about a seven year old child choking from a hot dog. Traffic was horrific  and we were coming from the other side of town in the north part of Jerusalem. When we got there     minutes later  we started CPR on the kid. A doctor comes in from a block away  stop us  checks the kid  and tells us to stop CPR. That second he declared this child dead. At that moment  I understood that this child died for nothing. If this doctor  who lived one block away from there  would have come    minutes earlier  not have to wait until that siren he heard before coming from the ambulance  if he would have heard about it way before  he would have saved this child. He could have run from a block away. He could have saved this child. I said to myself  there must be a better way. Together with    of my friends    we were all EMTs   we decided  let's protect our neighborhood  so when something like that happens again  we will be there running to the scene a lot before the ambulance. So I went over to the manager of the ambulance company and I told him   Please  whenever you have a call coming into our neighborhood  we have    great guys who are willing to stop everything they're doing and run and save lives. Just alert us by beeper. We'll buy these beepers  just tell your dispatch to send us the beeper  and we will run and save lives.  Well  he was laughing. I was    years old. I was a kid. And he said to me   I remember this like yesterday   he was a great guy  but he said to me   Kid  go to school  or go open a falafel stand. We're not really interested in these kinds of new adventures. We're not interested in your help.  And he threw me out of the room.  I don't need your help   he said. I was a very stubborn kid. As you see now  I'm walking around like crazy  meshugenah. So I decided to use the Israeli very famous technique you've probably all heard of  chutzpah.  Laughter  And the next day  I went and I bought two police scanners  and I said   The hell with you  if you don't want to give me information  I'll get the information myself.  And we did turns  who's going to listen to the radio scanners. The next day  while I was listening to the scanners  I heard about a call coming in of a    year old man hurt by a car only one block away from me on the main street of my neighborhood. I ran there by foot. I had no medical equipment. When I got there  the    year old man was lying on the floor  blood was gushing out of his neck. He was on Coumadin. I knew I had to stop his bleeding or else he would die. I took off my yarmulke  because I had no medical equipment  and with a lot of pressure  I stopped his bleeding. He was bleeding from his neck. When the ambulance arrived    minutes later  I gave them over a patient who was alive. When I went to visit him two days later  he gave me a hug and was crying and thanking me for saving his life. At that moment  when I realized this is the first person I ever saved in my life after two years volunteering in an ambulance  I knew this is my life's mission. So today     years later  we have United Hatzalah.  Hatzalah  means  rescue   for all of you who don't know Hebrew. I forgot I'm not in Israel. So we have thousands of volunteers who are passionate about saving lives  and they're spread all around  so whenever a call comes in  they just stop everything and go and run and save a life. Our average response time today went down to less than three minutes in Israel. I'm talking about heart attacks  I'm talking about car accidents  God forbid bomb attacks  shootings  whatever it is  even a woman   o'clock in the morning falling in her home and needs someone to help her. Three minutes  we'll have a guy with his pajamas running to her house and helping her get up. The reasons why we're so successful are because of three things. Thousands of passionate volunteers who will leave everything they do and run to help people they don't even know. We're not there to replace ambulances. We're just there to get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive. And we save people that otherwise would not be saved. The second reason is because of our technology. You know  Israelis are good in technology. Every one of us has on his phone  no matter what kind of phone  a GPS technology done by NowForce  and whenever a call comes in  the closest five volunteers get the call  and they actually get there really quick  and navigated by a traffic navigator to get there and not waste time. And this is a great technology we use all over the country and reduce the response time. And the third thing are these ambucycles. These ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels. We don't transfer people  but we stabilize them  and we save their lives. They never get stuck in traffic. They could even go on a sidewalk. They never  literally  get stuck in traffic. That's why we get there so fast. A few years after I started this organization  in a Jewish community  two Muslims from east Jerusalem called me up. They ask me to meet. They wanted to meet with me. Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan. When Muhammad told me his personal story  how his father     years old  collapsed at home  had a cardiac arrest  and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive  and he saw his father die in front of his eyes  he asked me   Please start this in east Jerusalem.  I said to myself  I saw so much tragedy  so much hate  and it's not about saving Jews. It's not about saving Muslims. It's not about saving Christians. It's about saving people. So I went ahead  full force    and I started United Hatzalah in east Jerusalem  and that's why the names United and Hatzalah match so well. We started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs. Arabs were saving Jews. Jews were saving Arabs. Something special happened. Arabs and Jews  they don't always get along together  but here in this situation  the communities  literally  it's an unbelievable situation that happened  the diversities  all of a sudden they had a common interest  Let's save lives together. Settlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers. It's an unbelievable concept that could work only when you have such a great cause. And these are all volunteers. No one is getting money. They're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives. When my own father collapsed a few years ago from a cardiac arrest  one of the first volunteers to arrive to save my father was one of these Muslim volunteers from east Jerusalem who was in the first course to join Hatzalah. And he saved my father. Could you imagine how I felt in that moment  When I started this organization  I was    years old. I never imagined that one day I'd be speaking at TEDMED. I never even knew what TEDMED was then. I don't think it existed  but I never imagined  I never imagined that it's going to go all around  it's going to spread around  and this last year we started in Panama and Brazil. All I need is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me  passionate about saving lives  and willing to do it. And I'm actually starting it in India very soon with a friend who I met in Harvard just a while back. Hatzalah actually started in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew years before us in Williamsburg  and now it's all over the Jewish community in New York  even Australia and Mexico and many other Jewish communities. But it could spread everywhere. It's very easy to adopt. You even saw these volunteers in New York saving lives in the World Trade Center. Last year alone  we treated in Israel         people. Forty two thousand of them were life threatening situations. And we made a difference. I guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob  and it works. When I look all around here  I see lots of people who would go an extra mile  run an extra mile to save other people  no matter who they are  no matter what religion  no matter who  where they come from. We all want to be heroes. We just need a good idea  motivation and lots of chutzpah  and we could save millions of people that otherwise would not be saved. Thank you very much.   Oedipus Rex     The Lion King     Titus     Frida     The Magic Flute     Across The Universe   Julie Taymor  Thank you. Thank you very much. That's a few samples of the theater  opera and films that I have done over the last    years. But what I'd like to begin with right now is to take you back to a moment that I went through in Indonesia  which is a seminal moment in my life and  like all myths  these stories need to be retold and told  lest we forget them. And when I'm in the turbulent times  as we know  that I am right now  through the crucible and the fire of transformation  which is what all of you do  actually. Anybody who creates knows there's that point where it hasn't quite become the phoenix or the burnt char. And I am right there on the edge  which I'll tell you about  another story. I want to go back to Indonesia where I was about        years  a long time ago  on a fellowship. And I found myself  after two years there and performing and learning  on the island of Bali  on the edge of a crater  Gunung Batur. And I was in a village where there was an initiation ceremony for the young men  a rite of passage. Little did I know that it was mine as well. And as I sat in this temple square under this gigantic beringin banyan tree  in the dark  there was no electricity  just the full moon  down in this empty square  and I heard the most beautiful sounds  like a Charles Ives concert as I listened to the gamelan music from all the different villagers that came for this once every five years ceremony. And I thought I was alone in the dark under this tree. And all of a sudden  out of the dark  from the other end of the square  I saw the glint of mirrors lit by the moon. And these    old men who I'd seen before all of a sudden stood up in these full warrior costumes with the headdress and the spears  and no one was in the square  and I was hidden in the shadows. No one was there  and they came out  and they did this incredible dance.  Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha.  And they moved their bodies and they came forward  and the lights bounced off these costumes. And I've been in theater since I was    years old  and performing  creating  and I went   Who are they performing for with these elaborate costumes  these extraordinary headdresses   And I realized that they were performing for God  whatever that means. But somehow  it didn't matter about the publicity. There was no money involved. It wasn't going to be written down. It was no news. And there were these incredible artists that felt for me like an eternity as they performed. The next moment  as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows  a young man with a propane lantern came on  hung it up on a tree  set up a curtain. The village square was filled with hundreds of people. And they put on an opera all night long. Human beings needed the light. They needed the light to see. So what I gained and gathered from this incredible  seminal moment in my life as a young artist was that you must be true to what you believe as an artist all the way through  but you also have to be aware that the audience is out there in our lives at this time  and they also need the light. And it's this incredible balance that I think that we walk when we are creating something that is breaking ground  that's trying to do something you've never seen before  that imaginary world where you actually don't know where you're going to end up  that's the fine line on the edge of a crater that I have walked my whole life. What I would like to do now is to tell you a little bit about how I work. Let's take  The Lion King.  You saw many examples of my work up there  but it's one that people know. I start with the notion of the ideograph. An ideograph is like a brush painting  a Japanese brush painting. Three strokes  you get the whole bamboo forest. I go to the concept of  The Lion King  and I say   What is the essence of it  What is the abstraction  If I were to reduce this entire story into one image  what would it be   The circle. The circle. It's so obvious. The circle of life. The circle of Mufasa's mask. The circle that  when we come to Act II and there's a drought  how do you express drought  It's a circle of silk on the floor that disappears into the hole in the stage floor. The circle of life comes in the wheels of the gazelles that leap. And you see the mechanics. And being a theater person  what I know and love about the theater is that when the audience comes in and they suspend their disbelief  when you see men walking or women walking with a platter of grass on their heads  you know it's the savanna. You don't question that. I love the apparent truth of theater. I love that people are willing to fill in the blanks. The audience is willing to say   Oh  I know that's not a real sun. You took pieces of sticks. You added silk to the bottom. You suspended these pieces. You let it fall flat on the floor. And as it rises with the strings  I see that it's a sun. But the beauty of it is that it's just silk and sticks. And in a way  that is what makes it spiritual. That's what moves you. It's not the actual literal sunrise that's coming. It's the art of it. So in the theater  as much as the story is critical and the book and the language  the telling of the story  how it's told  the mechanics  the methods that you use  is equal to the story itself. And I'm one who loves high tech and low tech. So I could go from    For instance  I'll show you some  Spider Man  later  these incredible machines that move people along. But the fact is  without the dancer who knows how to use his body and swing on those wires  it's nothing. So now I'm going to show you some clips from the other big project of my life this year   The Tempest.  It's a movie. I did  The Tempest  on a stage three times in the theater since       '    and I love the play. I did it always with a male Prospero. And all of a sudden  I thought   Well  who am I gonna get to play Prospero  Why not Helen Mirren  She's a great actor. Why not   And this material really did work for a woman equally as well. So now  let's take a look at some of the images from  The Tempest.  Ariel  I boarded the king's ship. In every cabin  I flamed amazement. Prospera  At first sight  they have changed eyes. Miranda  Do you love me  Ferdinand  Beyond all limit. HM  They are both in either's powers. Trinculo  Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows. Looking for business  governor  Caliban  Hast thou not dropped from heaven  Stephano  Out of the moon  I do assure thee. Prospera  Caliban  Caliban  This island is mine. Prospera  For this  be sure  tonight thou shalt have cramps. Antonio  Here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon. Sebastian  Draw thy sword. And I  the king  shall love thee. Prospera  I will plague them all  even to roaring. Ariel  I have made you mad. Prospera  We are such stuff as dreams are made on. and our little life is rounded with a sleep. JT  Okay. So I went from theater  doing  The Tempest  on the stage in a very low budget production many years ago  and I love the play  and I also think it's Shakespeare's last play  and it really lends itself  as you can see  to cinema. But I'm just going to give you a little example about how one stages it in theater and then how one takes that same idea or story and moves it into cinema. The ideograph that I talked to you about before  what is it for  The Tempest   What  if I were to boil it down  would be the one image that I could hang my hat on for this  And it was the sand castle  the idea of nurture versus nature  that we build these civilizations    she speaks about it at the end  Helen Mirren's Prospera    we build them  but under nature  under the grand tempest  these cloud capped towers  these gorgeous palaces will fade and there will    leave not a rack behind. So in the theater  I started the play  it was a black sand rake  white cyc  and there was a little girl  Miranda  on the horizon  building a drip castle  a sand castle. And as she was there on the edge of that stage  two stagehands all in black with watering cans ran along the top and started to pour water on the sand castle  and the sand castle started to drip and sink  but before it did  the audience saw the black clad stagehands. The medium was apparent. It was banal. We saw it. But as they started to pour the water  the light changed from showing you the black clad stagehands to focusing  this rough magic that we do in theater  it focused right on the water itself. And all of a sudden  the audience's perspective changes. It becomes something magically large. It becomes the rainstorm. The masked actors  the puppeteers  they disappear  and the audience makes that leap into this world  into this imaginary world of  The Tempest  actually happening. Now the difference when I went and did it in the cinema  I started the actual movie with a close up of a sand castle  a black sand castle  and what cinema can do is  by using camera  perspective  and also long shots and close ups  it started on a close up of the sand castle  and as it pulled away  you saw that it was a miniature sitting in the palm of the girl's hands. And so I could play with the medium  and why I move from one medium to another is to be able to do this. Now I'm going to take you to  Spider Man.  I can soar away from this.   JT  We're trying to do everything in live theater that you can't do in two dimensions in film and television. PP    Rise above yourself and take control.   George Tsypin  We're looking at New York from a Spider Man point of view. Spider Man is not bound by gravity. Manhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either. PP    Be yourself and rise above it all.   Ensemble    Sock  Pow      Slam  Scratch    Danny Ezralow  I don't want you to even think there's a choreographer. It's real  what's happening. I prefer you to see people moving  and you're going   Whoa  what was that   JT  If I give enough movement in the sculpture  and the actor moves their head  you feel like it's alive. It's really comic book live. It's a comic book coming alive. Bono  They're mythologies. They're modern myths  these comic book heroes. PP    They believe.   JT  Ohhhh. What was that  Circus  rock 'n' roll  drama. What the hell are we doing up there on that stage  Well  one last story  very quickly. After I was in that village  I crossed the lake  and I saw that the volcano was erupting on the other side  Gunung Batur  and there was a dead volcano next to the live volcano. I didn't think I'd be swallowed by the volcano  and I am here. But it's very easy to climb up  is it not  You hold on to the roots  you put your foot in the little rocks and climb up there  and you get to the top  and I was with a good friend who was an actor  and we said   Let's go up there. Let's see if we can come close to the edge of that live volcano.  And we climbed up and we got to the very top  and we're on the edge  on this precipice  Roland disappears into the sulfur smoke at the volcano at the other end  and I'm up there alone on this incredible precipice. Did you hear the lyrics  I'm on the precipice looking down into a dead volcano to my left. To my right is sheer shale. It's coming off. I'm in thongs and sarongs. It was many years ago. And no hiking boots. And he's disappeared  this mad French gypsy actor  off in the smoke  and I realize  I can't go back the way that I've come. I can't. So I throw away my camera. I throw away my thongs  and I looked at the line straight in front of me  and I got down on all fours like a cat  and I held with my knees to either side of this line in front of me  for    yards or    feet  I don't know. The wind was massively blowing  and the only way I could get to the other side was to look at the line straight in front of me. I know you've all been there. I'm in the crucible right now. It's my trial by fire. It's my company's trials by fire. We survive because our theme song is  Rise Above.  Boy falls from the sky  rise above. It's right there in the palm of both of our hands  of all of my company's hands. I have beautiful collaborators  and we as creators only get there all together. I know you understand that. And you just stay going forward  and then you see this extraordinary thing in front of your eyes. Thank you. Motor racing is a funny old business. We make a new car every year  and then we spend the rest of the season trying to understand what it is we've built to make it better  to make it faster. And then the next year  we start again. Now  the car you see in front of you is quite complicated. The chassis is made up of about        components  the engine another        the electronics about eight and a half thousand. So there's about        things there that can go wrong. So motor racing is very much about attention to detail. The other thing about Formula   in particular is we're always changing the car. We're always trying to make it faster. So every two weeks  we will be making about       new components to fit to the car. Five to    percent of the race car will be different every two weeks of the year. So how do we do that  Well  we start our life with the racing car. We have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things. On the race car in front of you here there are about     sensors when it goes into a race. It's measuring all sorts of things around the car. That data is logged. We're logging about     different parameters within the data systems  about        health parameters and events to say when things are not working the way they should do  and we're sending that data back to the garage using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second. So during a two hour race  each car will be sending     million numbers. That's twice as many numbers as words that each of us speaks in a lifetime. It's a huge amount of data. But it's not enough just to have data and measure it. You need to be able to do something with it. So we've spent a lot of time and effort in turning the data into stories to be able to tell  what's the state of the engine  how are the tires degrading  what's the situation with fuel consumption  So all of this is taking data and turning it into knowledge that we can act upon. Okay  so let's have a look at a little bit of data. Let's pick a bit of data from another three month old patient. This is a child  and what you're seeing here is real data  and on the far right hand side  where everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic  that is the patient going into cardiac arrest. It was deemed to be an unpredictable event. This was a heart attack that no one could see coming. But when we look at the information there  we can see that things are starting to become a little fuzzy about five minutes or so before the cardiac arrest. We can see small changes in things like the heart rate moving. These were all undetected by normal thresholds which would be applied to data. So the question is  why couldn't we see it  Was this a predictable event  Can we look more at the patterns in the data to be able to do things better  So this is a child  about the same age as the racing car on stage  three months old. It's a patient with a heart problem. Now  when you look at some of the data on the screen above  things like heart rate  pulse  oxygen  respiration rates  they're all unusual for a normal child  but they're quite normal for the child there  and so one of the challenges you have in health care is  how can I look at the patient in front of me  have something which is specific for her  and be able to detect when things start to change  when things start to deteriorate  Because like a racing car  any patient  when things start to go bad  you have a short time to make a difference. So what we did is we took a data system which we run every two weeks of the year in Formula   and we installed it on the hospital computers at Birmingham Children's Hospital. We streamed data from the bedside instruments in their pediatric intensive care so that we could both look at the data in real time and  more importantly  to store the data so that we could start to learn from it. And then  we applied an application on top which would allow us to tease out the patterns in the data in real time so we could see what was happening  so we could determine when things started to change. Now  in motor racing  we're all a little bit ambitious  audacious  a little bit arrogant sometimes  so we decided we would also look at the children as they were being transported to intensive care. Why should we wait until they arrived in the hospital before we started to look  And so we installed a real time link between the ambulance and the hospital  just using normal  G telephony to send that data so that the ambulance became an extra bed in intensive care. And then we started looking at the data. So the wiggly lines at the top  all the colors  this is the normal sort of data you would see on a monitor    heart rate  pulse  oxygen within the blood  and respiration. The lines on the bottom  the blue and the red  these are the interesting ones. The red line is showing an automated version of the early warning score that Birmingham Children's Hospital were already running. They'd been running that since       and already have stopped cardiac arrests and distress within the hospital. The blue line is an indication of when patterns start to change  and immediately  before we even started putting in clinical interpretation  we can see that the data is speaking to us. It's telling us that something is going wrong. The plot with the red and the green blobs  this is plotting different components of the data against each other. The green is us learning what is normal for that child. We call it the cloud of normality. And when things start to change  when conditions start to deteriorate  we move into the red line. There's no rocket science here. It is displaying data that exists already in a different way  to amplify it  to provide cues to the doctors  to the nurses  so they can see what's happening. In the same way that a good racing driver relies on cues to decide when to apply the brakes  when to turn into a corner  we need to help our physicians and our nurses to see when things are starting to go wrong. So we have a very ambitious program. We think that the race is on to do something differently. We are thinking big. It's the right thing to do. We have an approach which  if it's successful  there's no reason why it should stay within a hospital. It can go beyond the walls. With wireless connectivity these days  there is no reason why patients  doctors and nurses always have to be in the same place at the same time. And meanwhile  we'll take our little three month old baby  keep taking it to the track  keeping it safe  and making it faster and better. Thank you very much. I'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before  What is possible with the human voice  What is possible with the human voice    Ooh baby     baby     baby     baby    Baby crying    baby    Baby crying    baby    Cat meowing  Yeah. It was coming straight for me. I had to. It was  yeah. As you can probably well imagine  I was a strange child. Because the thing is  I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be. I was constantly experimenting with these noises. And I'm still on that mission. I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make. And the thing is  I'm a bit older and wiser now  and I know that there's some noises I'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body  and there's things it can't do. And there's things that no one's voice can do. For example  no one can do two notes at the same time. You can do two tone singing  which monks can do  which is like... But that's cheating. And it hurts your throat. So there's things you can't do  and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me  because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world  but they're sketches at best  which is what's annoyed me. If only  if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it. So I've been working with these guys  and we've made a machine. We've made a system which is basically a live production machine  a real time music production machine  and it enables me to  using nothing but my voice  create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me. And I'm going to show you what it can do. And before I start making noises with it  and using it to manipulate my voice  I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice. This system has    thank you  beautiful assistant    this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it  so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind. So once this thing really gets going  and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it  it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice  but it is  so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple. So the polyphony problem  I've only got one voice. How do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time. The simplest way to do it is something like this. By dancing. It's like this. Thanks. So that's probably the easiest way. But if you want to do something a little bit more immediate  something that you can't achieve with live looping  there's other ways to layer your voice up. There's things like pitch shifting  which are awesome  and I'm going to show you now what that sounds like. So I'm going to start another beat for you  like this. There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start  because it's just fun  so you can clap along if you want. You don't have to. It's fine. Check it out. I'm going to lay down a bass sound now. And now  a rockabilly guitar. Which is nice. But what if I want to make  say  a     Applause     Thanks. What if I want to make  say  a rock organ  Is that possible  Yes  it is  by recording myself like this. And now I have that  I have that recorded. Assign it to a keyboard. So that's cool. But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd  Impossible  you say. No. It is possible  and you can do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out. So every noise you can hear there is my voice. I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that. There's no samples. There's no synthesizers. That is literally all my voice being manipulated  and when you get to that point  you have to ask  don't you  what's the point  Why do this   Laughter  Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd  I suppose  is the easy answer. But in actual fact  I haven't made this machine so that I can emulate things that already exist. I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine. So with your permission  I'm going to do some things that are in my mind  and I hope you enjoy them  because they're rather unusual  especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this  it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice  you see. Like this. So  loosely defined  that is what's possible with the human voice. Thank you very much  ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dan Cohen and I am an academic  as he said. And what that means is that I argue. It's an important part of my life. And I like to argue. And I'm not just an academic  I'm a philosopher  so I like to think that I'm actually pretty good at arguing. But I also like to think a lot about arguing. And in thinking about arguing  I've come across some puzzles. And one of the puzzles is that  as I've been thinking about arguing over the years    and it's been decades now    I've gotten better at arguing. But the more that I argue and the better I get at arguing  the more that I lose. And that's a puzzle. And the other puzzle is that I'm actually okay with that. Why is it that I'm okay with losing and why is it that I think good arguers are actually better at losing  Well  there are some other puzzles. One is  why do we argue  Who benefits from arguments  When I think about arguments  I'm talking about    let's call them academic arguments or cognitive arguments    where something cognitive is at stake  Is this proposition true  Is this theory a good theory  Is this a viable interpretation of the data or the text  And so on. I'm not interested really in arguments about whose turn it is to do the dishes or who has to take out the garbage. Yeah  we have those arguments  too. I tend to win those arguments  because I know the tricks. But those aren't the important arguments. I'm interested in academic arguments  and here are the things that puzzle me. First  what do good arguers win when they win an argument  What do I win if I convince you that utilitarianism isn't really the right framework for thinking about ethical theories  What do we win when we win an argument  Even before that  what does it matter to me whether you have this idea that Kant's theory works or Mill is the right ethicist to follow  It's no skin off my back whether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind. So why do we even try to argue  Why do we try to convince other people to believe things they don't want to believe  and is that even a nice thing to do  Is that a nice way to treat another human being  try and make them think something they don't want to think  Well  my answer is going to make reference to three models for arguments. The first model    let's call it the dialectical model    is we think of arguments as war  you know what that's like    a lot of screaming and shouting and winning and losing. That's not a very helpful model for arguing  but it's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing. But there's a second model for arguing  arguments as proofs. Think of a mathematician's argument. Here's my argument. Does it work  Is it any good  Are the premises warranted  Are the inferences valid  Does the conclusion follow from the premises  No opposition  no adversariality    not necessarily any arguing in the adversarial sense. But there's a third model to keep in mind that I think is going to be very helpful  and that is arguments as performances  arguments in front of an audience. We can think of a politician trying to present a position  trying to convince the audience of something. But there's another twist on this model that I really think is important  namely  that when we argue before an audience  sometimes the audience has a more participatory role in the argument  that is  arguments are also  performances  in front of juries  who make a judgment and decide the case. Let's call this the rhetorical model  where you have to tailor your argument to the audience at hand. You know  presenting a sound  well argued  tight argument in English before a francophone audience just isn't going to work. So we have these models    argument as war  argument as proof and argument as performance. Of those three  the argument as war is the dominant one. It dominates how we talk about arguments  it dominates how we think about arguments  and because of that  it shapes how we argue  our actual conduct in arguments. Now  when we talk about arguments  we talk in a very militaristic language. We want strong arguments  arguments that have a lot of punch  arguments that are right on target. We want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order. We want killer arguments. That's the kind of argument we want. It is the dominant way of thinking about arguments. When I'm talking about arguments  that's probably what you thought of  the adversarial model. But the war metaphor  the war paradigm or model for thinking about arguments  has  I think  deforming effects on how we argue. First  it elevates tactics over substance. You can take a class in logic  argumentation. You learn all about the subterfuges that people use to try and win arguments    the false steps. It magnifies the us versus them aspect of it. It makes it adversarial  it's polarizing. And the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph    glorious triumph    or abject  ignominious defeat. I think those are deforming effects  and worst of all  it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation or compromise or collaboration. Think about that one    have you ever entered an argument thinking   Let's see if we can hash something out  rather than fight it out. What can we work out together   I think the argument as war metaphor inhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation. And finally    this is really the worst thing    arguments don't seem to get us anywhere  they're dead ends. They are like roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock in conversation. We don't get anywhere. And one more thing. And as an educator  this is the one that really bothers me  If argument is war  then there's an implicit equation of learning with losing. And let me explain what I mean. Suppose you and I have an argument. You believe a proposition  P  and I don't. And I say   Well  why do you believe P   And you give me your reasons. And I object and say   Well  what about ...   And you answer my objection. And I have a question   Well  what do you mean  How does it apply over here   And you answer my question. Now  suppose at the end of the day  I've objected  I've questioned  I've raised all sorts of counter counter considerations and in every case you've responded to my satisfaction. And so at the end of the day  I say   You know what  I guess you're right  P.  So  I have a new belief. And it's not just any belief  it's well articulated  examined    it's a battle tested belief. Great cognitive gain. OK  who won that argument  Well  the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won  even though I'm the only one who made any cognitive gain. What did you gain  cognitively  from convincing me  Sure  you got some pleasure out of it  maybe your ego stroked  maybe you get some professional status in the field     This guy's a good arguer.  But just from a cognitive point of view  who was the winner  The war metaphor forces us into thinking that you're the winner and I lost  even though I gained. And there's something wrong with that picture. And that's the picture I really want to change if we can. So  how can we find ways to make arguments yield something positive  What we need is new exit strategies for arguments. But we're not going to have new exit strategies for arguments until we have new entry approaches to arguments. We need to think of new kinds of arguments. In order to do that  well    I don't know how to do that. That's the bad news. The argument as war metaphor is just ... it's a monster. It's just taken up habitation in our mind  and there's no magic bullet that's going to kill it. There's no magic wand that's going to make it disappear. I don't have an answer. But I have some suggestions. Here's my suggestion  If we want to think of new kinds of arguments  what we need to do is think of new kinds of arguers. So try this  Think of all the roles that people play in arguments. There's the proponent and the opponent in an adversarial  dialectical argument. There's the audience in rhetorical arguments. There's the reasoner in arguments as proofs. All these different roles. Now  can you imagine an argument in which you are the arguer  but you're also in the audience  watching yourself argue  Can you imagine yourself watching yourself argue  losing the argument  and yet still  at the end of the argument  saying   Wow  that was a good argument   Can you do that  I think you can  and I think if you can imagine that kind of argument  where the loser says to the winner and the audience and the jury can say   Yeah  that was a good argument   then you have imagined a good argument. And more than that  I think you've imagined a good arguer  an arguer that's worthy of the kind of arguer you should try to be. Now  I lose a lot of arguments. It takes practice to become a good arguer  in the sense of being able to benefit from losing  but fortunately  I've had many  many colleagues who have been willing to step up and provide that practice for me. Thank you. In an age of global strife and climate change  I'm here to answer the all important question  Why is sex so damn good  If you're laughing  you know what I mean. Now  before we get to that answer  let me tell you about Chris Hosmer. Chris is a great friend of mine from my university days  but secretly  I hate him. Here's why. Back in university  we had a quick project to design some solar powered clocks. Here's my clock. It uses something called the dwarf sunflower  which grows to about    inches in height. Now  as you know  sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day. So in the morning  you see which direction the sunflower is facing  and you mark it on the blank area in the base. At noon  you mark the changed position of the sunflower  and in the evening again  and that's your clock. Now  I know my clock doesn't tell you the exact time  but it does give you a general idea using a flower. So  in my completely unbiased  subjective opinion  it's brilliant. However  here's Chris' clock. It's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one. In each shot glass is a different scented oil. In the morning  the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass  focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath. This will warm up the scented oil inside  and a particular smell will be emitted. A couple of hours later  the sun will shine on the next magnifying glass  and a different smell will be emitted. So during the course of the day  five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment. Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell. You can see why I hate Chris. I thought my idea was pretty good  but his idea is genius  and at the time  I knew his idea was better than mine  but I just couldn't explain why. One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose. This problem's been bugging me for well over a decade. All right  let's get back to the question of why sex is so good. Many years after the solar powered clocks project  a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses. And when she said this  I had an epiphany. So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses. To do this  I devised something called the five senses graph. Along the y axis  you have a scale from zero to     and along the x axis  you have  of course  the five senses. Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life  I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary. Here's a quick video to show you how it works. and today  I'm going to show you what riding motorbikes is like from the point of view of the five senses. Hey  Bike designer  This is  unclear   custom bike designer.  Sound   Touch   Sight   Smell   Taste  JL  And that's how the five senses graph works. Now  for a period of three years  I gathered data  not just me but also some of my friends  and I used to teach in university  so I forced my    I mean  I asked my students to do this as well. So here are some other results. The first is for instant noodles. Now obviously  taste and smell are quite high  but notice sound is at three. Many people told me a big part of the noodle eating experience is the slurping noise. You know.  Slurps  Needless to say  I no longer dine with these people. Okay  next  clubbing. Okay  here what I found interesting was that taste is at four  and many respondents told me it's because of the taste of drinks  but also  in some cases  kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience. These people I still do hang out with. All right  and smoking. Here I found touch is at  six   and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience  which shows  it's kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers. Okay. Now  what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph  It would  of course  be a horizontal line along the top. Now you can see  not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close. In fact  in the years that I gathered data  only one experience came close to being the perfect one. That is  of course  sex. Great sex. Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level. Here I'll quote one of my students who said   Sex is so good  it's good even when it's bad.  So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good. Now in the middle of all this five senses work  I suddenly remembered the solar powered clocks project from my youth. And I realized this theory also explains why Chris' clock is so much better than mine. You see  my clock only focuses on sight  and a little bit of touch. Here's Chris' clock. It's the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time. In fact  in terms of the five senses  Chris' clock is a revolution. And that's what this theory taught me about my field. You see  up till now  us designers  we've mainly focused on making things look very pretty  and a little bit of touch  which means we've ignored the other three senses. Chris' clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product. So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs  Here's three quick ideas I came up with. This is an iron  you know  for your clothes  to which I added a spraying mechanism  so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent  and your clothes will smell nicer  but hopefully it should also make the ironing experience more enjoyable. We could call this  the perfumator.  All right  next. So I brush my teeth twice a day  and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy  and when the taste of candy ran out  you'd know it's time to change your toothbrush  Finally  I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet. It's not just the way they look  but I love the way they feel when you press down on them. Now  I don't play the flute or the clarinet  so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play  the television remote control. Now  when we look at these three ideas together  you'll notice that the five senses theory doesn't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look. So in conclusion  I've found the five senses theory to be a very useful tool in evaluating different experiences in my life  and then taking those best experiences and hopefully incorporating them into my designs. Now  I realize the five senses isn't the only thing that makes life interesting. There's also the six emotions and that elusive x factor. Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk. Until then  please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs. Oh  one last thing before I leave. Here's the experience you all had while listening to the TED Talks. However  it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses like smell and taste. And the best way to do that is with free candy. You guys ready  All right. I moved back home    years ago after a    year stay in the United States  and Africa called me back. And I founded my country's first graphic design and new media college. And I called it the Zimbabwe Institute of Vigital Arts. The idea  the dream  was really for a sort of Bauhaus sort of school where new ideas were interrogated and investigated  the creation of a new visual language based on the African creative heritage. We offer a two year diploma to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education. And typography's a very important part of the curriculum and we encourage our students to look inward for influence. Here's a poster designed by one of the students under the theme  Education is a right.  Some logos designed by my students. Africa has had a long tradition of writing  but this is not such a well known fact  and I wrote the book  Afrikan Alphabets  to address that. The different types of writing in Africa  first was proto writing  as illustrated by Nsibidi  which is the writing system of a secret society of the Ejagham people in southern Nigeria. So it's a special interest writing system. The Akan of people of Ghana and  Cote d'Ivoire  developed Adinkra symbols some     years ago  and these are proverbs  historical sayings  objects  animals  plants  and my favorite Adinkra system is the first one at the top on the left. It's called Sankofa. It means   Return and get it.  Learn from the past. This pictograph by the Jokwe people of Angola tells the story of the creation of the world. At the top is God  at the bottom is man  mankind  and on the left is the sun  on the right is the moon. All the paths lead to and from God. These secret societies of the Yoruba  Kongo and Palo religions in Nigeria  Congo and Angola respectively  developed this intricate writing system which is alive and well today in the New World in Cuba  Brazil and Trinidad and Haiti. In the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo  in the Ituri society  the men pound out a cloth out of a special tree  and the women  who are also the praise singers  paint interweaving patterns that are the same in structure as the polyphonic structures that they use in their singing    a sort of a musical score  if you may. In South Africa  Ndebele women use these symbols and other geometric patterns to paint their homes in bright colors  and the Zulu women use the symbols in the beads that they weave into bracelets and necklaces. Ethiopia has had the longest tradition of writing  with the Ethiopic script that was developed in the fourth century A.D. and is used to write Amharic  which is spoken by over    million people. King Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum Kingdom of Cameroon developed Sh  mom at the age of   . Sh  mom is a writing system. It's a syllabary. It's not exactly an alphabet. And here we see three stages of development that it went through in    years. The Vai people of Liberia had a long tradition of literacy before their first contact with Europeans in the     s. It's a syllabary and reads from left to right. Next door  in Sierra Leone  the Mende also developed a syllabary  but theirs reads from right to left. Africa has had a long tradition of design  a well defined design sensibility  but the problem in Africa has been that  especially today  designers in Africa struggle with all forms of design because they are more apt to look outward for influence and inspiration. The creative spirit in Africa  the creative tradition  is as potent as it has always been  if only designers could look within. This Ethiopic cross illustrates what Dr. Ron Eglash has established  that Africa has a lot to contribute to computing and mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals. Africans of antiquity created civilization  and their monuments  which still stand today  are a true testimony of their greatness. Most probably  one of humanity's greatest achievements is the invention of the alphabet  and that has been attributed to Mesopotamia with their invention of cuneiform in      BC  followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt  and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact. That is  until       when one Yale professor John Coleman Darnell discovered these inscriptions in the Thebes desert on the limestone cliffs in western Egypt  and these have been dated at between      and      B.C.  centuries before Mesopotamia. Called Wadi el Hol because of the place that they were discovered  these inscriptions    research is still going on  a few of them have been deciphered  but there is consensus among scholars that this is really humanity's first alphabet. Over here  you see a paleographic chart that shows what has been deciphered so far  starting with the letter A    lep   at the top  and  b t   in the middle  and so forth. It is time that students of design in Africa read the works of titans like Cheikh Anta Diop  Senegal's Cheikh Anta Diop  whose seminal work on Egypt is vindicated by this discovery. The last word goes to the great Jamaican leader Marcus Mosiah Garvey and the Akan people of Ghana with their Adinkra symbol Sankofa  which encourages us to go to the past so as to inform our present and build on a future for us and our children. It is also time that designers in Africa stop looking outside. They've been looking outward for a long time  yet what they were looking for has been right there within grasp  right within them. Thank you very much. The day I left home for the first time to go to university was a bright day brimming with hope and optimism. I'd done well at school. Expectations for me were high  and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures  parties and traffic cone theft. Now appearances  of course  can be deceptive  and to an extent  this feisty  energetic persona of lecture going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer  albeit a very well crafted and convincing one. Underneath  I was actually deeply unhappy  insecure and fundamentally frightened    frightened of other people  of the future  of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me. But I was skilled at hiding it  and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and aspire to. This fantasy of invulnerability was so complete that I even deceived myself  and as the first semester ended and the second began  there was no way that anyone could have predicted what was just about to happen. I was leaving a seminar when it started  humming to myself  fumbling with my bag just as I'd done a hundred times before  when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe   She is leaving the room.  I looked around  and there was no one there  but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable. Shaken  I left my books on the stairs and hurried home  and there it was again.  She is opening the door.  This was the beginning. The voice had arrived. And the voice persisted  days and then weeks of it  on and on  narrating everything I did in the third person.  She is going to the library.   She is going to a lecture.  It was neutral  impassive and even  after a while  strangely companionate and reassuring  although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion. So  for example  if I was angry and had to hide it  which I often did  being very adept at concealing how I really felt  then the voice would sound frustrated. Otherwise  it was neither sinister nor disturbing  although even at that point it was clear that it had something to communicate to me about my emotions  particularly emotions which were remote and inaccessible. Now it was then that I made a fatal mistake  in that I told a friend about the voice  and she was horrified. A subtle conditioning process had begun  the implication that normal people don't hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong. Such fear and mistrust was infectious. Suddenly the voice didn't seem quite so benign anymore  and when she insisted that I seek medical attention  I duly complied  and which proved to be mistake number two. I spent some time telling the college G.P. about what I perceived to be the real problem  anxiety  low self worth  fears about the future  and was met with bored indifference until I mentioned the voice  upon which he dropped his pen  swung round and began to question me with a show of real interest. And to be fair  I was desperate for interest and help  and I began to tell him about my strange commentator. And I always wish  at this point  the voice had said   She is digging her own grave.  I was referred to a psychiatrist  who likewise took a grim view of the voice's presence  subsequently interpreting everything I said through a lens of latent insanity. For example  I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus  and during an appointment which was running very late  I said   I'm sorry  doctor  I've got to go. I'm reading the news at six.  Now it's down on my medical records that Eleanor has delusions that she's a television news broadcaster. It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me. A hospital admission followed  the first of many  a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next  and then  worst of all  a toxic  tormenting sense of hopelessness  humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects. But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom  my fear and resistance towards it intensified. Now essentially  this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind  a kind of psychic civil war  and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing. Helplessly and hopelessly  I began to retreat into this nightmarish inner world in which the voices were destined to become both my persecutors and my only perceived companions. They told me  for example  that if I proved myself worthy of their help  then they could change my life back to how it had been  and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set  a kind of labor of Hercules. It started off quite small  for example  pull out three strands of hair  but gradually it grew more extreme  culminating in commands to harm myself  and a particularly dramatic instruction   You see that tutor over there  You see that glass of water  Well  you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students.  Which I actually did  and which needless to say did not endear me to the faculty. In effect  a vicious cycle of fear  avoidance  mistrust and misunderstanding had been established  and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation. Two years later  and the deterioration was dramatic. By now  I had the whole frenzied repertoire  terrifying voices  grotesque visions  bizarre  intractable delusions. My mental health status had been a catalyst for discrimination  verbal abuse  and physical and sexual assault  and I'd been told by my psychiatrist   Eleanor  you'd be better off with cancer  because cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia.  I'd been diagnosed  drugged and discarded  and was by now so tormented by the voices that I attempted to drill a hole in my head in order to get them out. Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years  it seems to me now as if someone died in that place  and yet  someone else was saved. A broken and haunted person began that journey  but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be. Many people have harmed me in my life  and I remember them all  but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who've helped me. The fellow survivors  the fellow voice hearers  the comrades and collaborators  the mother who never gave up on me  who knew that one day I would come back to her and was willing to wait for me for as long as it took  the doctor who only worked with me for a brief time but who reinforced his belief that recovery was not only possible but inevitable  and during a devastating period of relapse told my terrified family   Don't give up hope. I believe that Eleanor can get through this. Sometimes  you know  it snows as late as May  but summer always comes eventually.  Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized  lonely place. But together  they forged a blend of courage  creativity  integrity  and an unshakeable belief that my shattered self could become healed and whole. I used to say that these people saved me  but what I now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself  and crucially  they helped me to understand something which I'd always suspected  that my voices were a meaningful response to traumatic life events  particularly childhood events  and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into solvable emotional problems. Now  at first  this was very difficult to believe  not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing  so in this respect  a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth. So for example  voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world  rather than an actual  objective danger. Now at first  I would have believed them. I remember  for example  sitting up one night on guard outside my parents' room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices. Because I'd had such a bad problem with self injury that most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden  so I ended up arming myself with a plastic fork  kind of like picnic ware  and sort of sat outside the room clutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen. It was like   Don't mess with me. I've got a plastic fork  don't you know   Strategic. But a later response  and much more useful  would be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words  so when the voices warned me not to leave the house  then I would thank them for drawing my attention to how unsafe I felt    because if I was aware of it  then I could do something positive about it    but go on to reassure both them and myself that we were safe and didn't need to feel frightened anymore. I would set boundaries for the voices  and try to interact with them in a way that was assertive yet respectful  establishing a slow process of communication and collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another. Throughout all of this  what I would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself  and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had an opportunity to process or resolve  memories of sexual trauma and abuse  of anger  shame  guilt  low self worth. The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it  and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly  and as such  it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care. It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self  each fragment represented by a different voice  gradually withdraw from all my medication  and return to psychiatry  only this time from the other side. Ten years after the voice first came  I finally graduated  this time with the highest degree in psychology the university had ever given  and one year later  the highest masters  which shall we say isn't bad for a madwoman. In fact  one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam  which technically possibly counts as cheating. And to be honest  sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well. As Oscar Wilde has said  the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. It also makes you very good at eavesdropping  because you can listen to two conversations simultaneously. So it's not all bad. I worked in mental health services  I spoke at conferences  I published book chapters and academic articles  and I argued  and continue to do so  the relevance of the following concept  that an important question in psychiatry shouldn't be what's wrong with you but rather what's happened to you. And all the while  I listened to my voices  with whom I'd finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn reflected a growing sense of compassion  acceptance and respect towards myself. And I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment when supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices  and becoming fully aware  for the very first time  that I no longer felt that way myself but was finally able to help someone else who was. I'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice  the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement  an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher  which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy  a sane reaction to insane circumstances  not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured  but a complex  significant and meaningful experience to be explored. Together  we envisage and enact a society that understands and respects voice hearing  supports the needs of individuals who hear voices  and which values them as full citizens. This type of society is not only possible  it's already on its way. To paraphrase Chavez  once social change begins  it cannot be reversed. You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride. You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore. For me  the achievements of the Hearing Voices Movement are a reminder that empathy  fellowship  justice and respect are more than words  they are convictions and beliefs  and that beliefs can change the world. In the last    years  the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in    countries across five continents  working together to promote dignity  solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress  to create a new language and practice of hope  which  at its very center  lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual. As Peter Levine has said  the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity. In this respect  for members of society  there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone  to bear witness  to reach out a hand  to share the burden of someone's suffering  and to hold the hope for their recovery. And likewise  for survivors of distress and adversity  that we remember we don't have to live our lives forever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us. We are unique. We are irreplaceable. What lies within us can never be truly colonized  contorted  or taken away. The light never goes out. As a very wonderful doctor once said to me   Don't tell me what other people have told you about yourself. Tell me about you.  Thank you. Adam Ockelford  I promise there won't be too much of me talking  and a lot of Derek playing  but I thought it would just be nice to recap on how Derek got to where he is today. It's amazing now  because he's so much bigger than me  but when Derek was born  he could have fitted on the palm of your hand. He was born three and a half months premature  and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive. He had to have a lot of oxygen  and that affected your eyes  Derek  and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world. But that was the end of the bad news  because when Derek came home from the hospital  his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you  Derek  really for the rest of your childhood. And Nanny's great insight  really  was to think  here's a child who can't see. Music must be the thing for Derek. And sure enough  she sang  or as Derek called it  warbled  to him for his first few years of life. And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe  you know  in his brain something was stirring  some sort of musical gift. Here's a little picture of Derek going up now  when you were with your nanny. Now Nanny's great other insight was to think  perhaps we should get Derek something to play  and sure enough  she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft  never thinking really that anything much would come of it. But Derek  your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it  bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break. But out of all the bashing  after a few months  emerged the most fantastic music  and I think there was just a miracle moment  really  Derek  when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard. That was the great eureka moment. Now  not being able to see meant  of course  that you taught yourself. Derek Paravicini  I taught myself to play. AO  You did teach yourself to play  and as a consequence  playing the piano for you  Derek  was a lot of knuckles and karate chops  and even a bit of nose going on in there. And now  here's what Nanny did also do was to press the record button on one of those little early tape recorders that they had  and this is a wonderful tape  now  of Derek playing when you were four years old. DP   Molly Malone  Cockles and Mussels .  AO  It wasn't actually  Cockles and Mussels.  This one is  English Country Garden.  DP   English Country Garden.  AO  There you are. I think that's just fantastic. You know  there's this little child who can't see  can't really understand much about the world  has no one in the family who plays an instrument  and yet he taught himself to play that. And as you can see from the picture  there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing  Derek. Now  along    Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old  and at first  Derek  I thought you were mad  to be honest  because when you played the piano  you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard  and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way. So as soon as I tried to get near the piano  I was firmly shoved off. And having said to your dad  Nic  that I would try to teach you  I was then slightly confused as to how I might go about that if I wasn't allowed near the piano. But after a while  I thought  well  the only way is to just pick you up  shove Derek over to the other side of the room  and in the    seconds that I got before Derek came back  I could just play something very quickly for him to learn. And in the end  Derek  I think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together. As you can see  there's me in my early  pre marriage days with a brown beard  and little Derek concentrating there. I just realized this is going to be recorded  isn't it  Right. Okay. Now then  by the age of     Derek really had taken the world by storm. This is a photo of you  Derek  playing at the Barbican with the Royal Philharmonic Pops. Basically it was just an exciting journey  really. And in those days  Derek  you didn't speak very much  and so there was always a moment of tension as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key  and all that kind of thing. But the orchestra were wowed as well  and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability to play these fantastic pieces. Now the question is  how do you do it  Derek  And hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do. I think that one of the first things that happened when you were very little  Derek  was that by the time you were two  your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults. And so whenever you heard any note at all    if I just play a random note    you knew instantly what it was  and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano. Now that's called perfect pitch  and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano. You can see how    you get a sense of playing with Derek. But Derek  your ear is so much more than that. If I just put the microphone down for a bit  I'm going to play a cluster of notes. Those of you who can see will know how many notes  but Derek  of course  can't. Not only can you say how many notes  it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are. Well  forget the terminology  Derek. Fantastic. And it's that ability  that ability to hear simultaneous sounds  not only just single sounds  but when a whole orchestra is playing  Derek  you can hear every note  and instantly  through all those hours and hours of practice  reproduce those on the keyboard  that makes you  I think  is the basis of all your ability. Now then. It's no use having that kind of raw ability without the technique  and luckily  Derek  you decided that  once we did start learning  you'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings. So for example using your thumb under with C major. Etc. And in the end  you got so quick  that things like  Flight of the Bumblebee  were no problem  were they  DP  No. AO  Right. So here  by the age of     Derek was playing things like this. DP  This. AO  Derek  let's have a bow. Well done. Now the truly amazing thing was  with all those scales  Derek  you could not only play  Flight of the Bumblebee  in the usual key  but any note I play  Derek can play it on. So if I just choose a note at random  like that one. Can you play  Flight of the Bumblebee  on that note  DP   Flight of the Bumblebee  on that note. AO  Or another one  How about in G minor  DP  G minor. AO  Fantastic. Well done  Derek. So you see  in your brain  Derek  is this amazing musical computer that can instantly recalibrate  recalculate  all the pieces in the world that are out there. Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said   Sorry  do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee' in B minor instead of A minor   as we went on. In fact  the first time  Derek  you played that with an orchestra  you'd learned the version that you'd learned  and then the orchestra  in fact  did have a different version  so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert  Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra. Fantastic chap. The other wonderful thing about you is memory. DP  Memory. AO  Your memory is truly amazing  and every concert we do  we ask the audience to participate  of course  by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play. And people say   Well  that's terribly brave because what happens if Derek doesn't know it   And I say   No  it's not brave at all  because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know  you're invited to come and sing it first  and then he'll pick it up.   Laughter  So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish. But seriously  would anyone like to choose a piece  DP  Choose a piece. Choose  choose  would you like to choose  AO  Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out. Would you like to hear me play  AO  Paganini. DP   The Theme of Paganini.  AO  Well done. Derek's going to L.A. soon  and it's a milestone  because it means that Derek and I will have spent over     hours on long haul flights together  which is quite interesting  isn't it Derek  DP  Very interesting  Adam  yes. Long haul flights. Yes. AO  You may think    hours is a long time to keep talking  but Derek does it effortlessly. Now then. But in America  they've coined this term   the human iPod  for Derek  which I think is just missing the point  really  because Derek  you're so much more than an iPod. You're a fantastic  creative musician  and I think that was nowhere clearer to see  really  than when we went to Slovenia  and someone    in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in  and this person  very  very nervously came onto the stage. DP  He played  Chopsticks.  AO  And played  Chopsticks.  DP   Chopsticks.  AO  A bit like this. DP  Like this. Yes. AO  I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it. He's sitting there. DP  Somebody played  Chopsticks  like this. AO  Just teasing  right  Here we go. DP  Let Derek play it. AO  What did you do with it  Derek  DP  I got to improvise with it  Adam. AO  This is Derek the musician. Keep up with Derek. The TED people will kill me  but perhaps there's time for one encore. DP  For one encore. AO  One encore  yes. So this is one of Derek's heroes. It's the great Art Tatum    DP  Art Tatum. AO     who also was a pianist who couldn't see  and also  I think  like Derek  thought that all the world was a piano  so whenever Art Tatum plays something  it sounds like there's three pianos in the room. And here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on  Tiger Rag.  DP   Tiger Rag.  In the northwest corner of the United States  right up near the Canadian border  there's a little town called Libby  Montana  and it's surrounded by pine trees and lakes and just amazing wildlife and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky. And in there is a little town called Libby  which I visited  which feels kind of lonely  a little isolated. And in Libby  Montana  there's a rather unusual woman named Gayla Benefield. She always felt a little bit of an outsider  although she's been there almost all her life  a woman of Russian extraction. She told me when she went to school  she was the only girl who ever chose to do mechanical drawing. Later in life  she got a job going house to house reading utility meters    gas meters  electricity meters. And she was doing the work in the middle of the day  and one thing particularly caught her notice  which was  in the middle of the day she met a lot of men who were at home  middle aged  late middle aged  and a lot of them seemed to be on oxygen tanks. It struck her as strange. Then  a few years later  her father died at the age of     five days before he was due to receive his pension. He'd been a miner. She thought he must just have been worn out by the work. But then a few years later  her mother died  and that seemed stranger still  because her mother came from a long line of people who just seemed to live forever. In fact  Gayla's uncle is still alive to this day  and learning how to waltz. It didn't make sense that Gayla's mother should die so young. It was an anomaly  and she kept puzzling over anomalies. And as she did  other ones came to mind. She remembered  for example  when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital  and she had a lot of x rays  and two of them were leg x rays  which made sense  but six of them were chest x rays  which didn't. She puzzled and puzzled over every piece of her life and her parents' life  trying to understand what she was seeing. She thought about her town. The town had a vermiculite mine in it. Vermiculite was used for soil conditioners  to make plants grow faster and better. Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts  huge amounts of it put under the roof to keep houses warm during the long Montana winters. Vermiculite was in the playground. It was in the football ground. It was in the skating rink. What she didn't learn until she started working this problem is vermiculite is a very toxic form of asbestos. When she figured out the puzzle  she started telling everyone she could what had happened  what had been done to her parents and to the people that she saw on oxygen tanks at home in the afternoons. But she was really amazed. She thought  when everybody knows  they'll want to do something  but actually nobody wanted to know. In fact  she became so annoying as she kept insisting on telling this story to her neighbors  to her friends  to other people in the community  that eventually a bunch of them got together and they made a bumper sticker  which they proudly displayed on their cars  which said   Yes  I'm from Libby  Montana  and no  I don't have asbestosis.  But Gayla didn't stop. She kept doing research. The advent of the Internet definitely helped her. She talked to anybody she could. She argued and argued  and finally she struck lucky when a researcher came through town studying the history of mines in the area  and she told him her story  and at first  of course  like everyone  he didn't believe her  but he went back to Seattle and he did his own research and he realized that she was right. So now she had an ally. Nevertheless  people still didn't want to know. They said things like   Well  if it were really dangerous  someone would have told us.   If that's really why everyone was dying  the doctors would have told us.  Some of the guys used to very heavy jobs said   I don't want to be a victim. I can't possibly be a victim  and anyway  every industry has its accidents.  But still Gayla went on  and finally she succeeded in getting a federal agency to come to town and to screen the inhabitants of the town           people    and what they discovered was that the town had a mortality rate    times higher than anywhere in the United States. That was in       and even at that moment  no one raised their hand to say   Gayla  look in the playground where your grandchildren are playing. It's lined with vermiculite.  This wasn't ignorance. It was willful blindness. Willful blindness is a legal concept which means  if there's information that you could know and you should know but you somehow manage not to know  the law deems that you're willfully blind. You have chosen not to know. There's a lot of willful blindness around these days. You can see willful blindness in banks  when thousands of people sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them. You could see them in banks when interest rates were manipulated and everyone around knew what was going on  but everyone studiously ignored it. You can see willful blindness in the Catholic Church  where decades of child abuse went ignored. You could see willful blindness in the run up to the Iraq War. Willful blindness exists on epic scales like those  and it also exists on very small scales  in people's families  in people's homes and communities  and particularly in organizations and institutions. Companies that have been studied for willful blindness can be asked questions like   Are there issues at work that people are afraid to raise   And when academics have done studies like this of corporations in the United States  what they find is    percent of people say yes. Eighty five percent of people know there's a problem  but they won't say anything. And when I duplicated the research in Europe  asking all the same questions  I found exactly the same number. Eighty five percent. That's a lot of silence. It's a lot of blindness. And what's really interesting is that when I go to companies in Switzerland  they tell me   This is a uniquely Swiss problem.  And when I go to Germany  they say   Oh yes  this is the German disease.  And when I go to companies in England  they say   Oh  yeah  the British are really bad at this.  And the truth is  this is a human problem. We're all  under certain circumstances  willfully blind. What the research shows is that some people are blind out of fear. They're afraid of retaliation. And some people are blind because they think  well  seeing anything is just futile. Nothing's ever going to change. If we make a protest  if we protest against the Iraq War  nothing changes  so why bother  Better not to see this stuff at all. And the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time is people say   Well  you know  the people who do see  they're whistleblowers  and we all know what happens to them.  So there's this profound mythology around whistleblowers which says  first of all  they're all crazy. But what I've found going around the world and talking to whistleblowers is  actually  they're very loyal and quite often very conservative people. They're hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for  and the reason that they speak up  the reason they insist on seeing  is because they care so much about the institution and want to keep it healthy. And the other thing that people often say about whistleblowers is   Well  there's no point  because you see what happens to them. They are crushed. Nobody would want to go through something like that.  And yet  when I talk to whistleblowers  the recurrent tone that I hear is pride. I think of Joe Darby. We all remember the photographs of Abu Ghraib  which so shocked the world and showed the kind of war that was being fought in Iraq. But I wonder who remembers Joe Darby  the very obedient  good soldier who found those photographs and handed them in. And he said   You know  I'm not the kind of guy to rat people out  but some things just cross the line. Ignorance is bliss  they say  but you can't put up with things like this.  I talked to Steve Bolsin  a British doctor  who fought for five years to draw attention to a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies. And I asked him why he did it  and he said   Well  it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it. She came up to me one night  and she just said  'Dad  you can't let the kids die.'  Or I think of Cynthia Thomas  a really loyal army daughter and army wife  who  as she saw her friends and relations coming back from the Iraq War  was so shocked by their mental condition and the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge post traumatic stress syndrome that she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town to give them legal  psychological and medical assistance. And she said to me  she said   You know  Margaret  I always used to say I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grow up. But I've found myself in this cause  and I'll never be the same.  We all enjoy so many freedoms today  hard won freedoms  the freedom to write and publish without fear of censorship  a freedom that wasn't here the last time I came to Hungary  a freedom to vote  which women in particular had to fight so hard for  the freedom for people of different ethnicities and cultures and sexual orientation to live the way that they want. But freedom doesn't exist if you don't use it  and what whistleblowers do  and what people like Gayla Benefield do is they use the freedom that they have. And what they're very prepared to do is recognize that yes  this is going to be an argument  and yes I'm going to have a lot of rows with my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends  but I'm going to become very good at this conflict. I'm going to take on the naysayers  because they'll make my argument better and stronger. I can collaborate with my opponents to become better at what I do. These are people of immense persistence  incredible patience  and an absolute determination not to be blind and not to be silent. When I went to Libby  Montana  I visited the asbestosis clinic that Gayla Benefield brought into being  a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went in the back door because they didn't want to acknowledge that she'd been right. I sat in a diner  and I watched as trucks drove up and down the highway  carting away the earth out of gardens and replacing it with fresh  uncontaminated soil. I took my    year old daughter with me  because I really wanted her to meet Gayla. And she said   Why  What's the big deal   I said   She's not a movie star  and she's not a celebrity  and she's not an expert  and Gayla's the first person who'd say she's not a saint. The really important thing about Gayla is she is ordinary. She's like you  and she's like me. She had freedom  and she was ready to use it.  Thank you very much. Hi. I am an architect. I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube  and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes.       much  much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues  I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure. It's very complicated to test the new material for the building  but this is much stronger than I expected  and also it's very easy to waterproof  and also  because it's industrial material  it's also possible to fireproof. Then I built the temporary structure      . This is the first temporary building made out of paper. There are     tubes  diameter     centimeters   there are only    tubes with a diameter of     centimeters  or four feet  wide. As you see it in the photo  inside is the toilet. In case you're finished with toilet paper  you can tear off the inside of the wall.  Laughter  So it's very useful. Year       there was a big expo in Germany. I was asked to design the building  because the theme of the expo was environmental issues. So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes  recyclable paper. My goal of the design is not when it's completed. My goal was when the building was demolished  because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year  we create a lot of industrial waste  so my building has to be reused or recycled. After  the building was recycled. So that was the goal of my design. Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz. Because I was so poor  I wanted to rent an office in Paris  but I couldn't afford it  so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves. So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the    meter long office. We stayed there for six years without paying any rent. Thank you. I had one big problem. Because we were part of the exhibition  even if my friend wanted to see me  they had to buy a ticket to see me. That was the problem. Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz. It's a very popular museum now  and I created a big monument for the government. But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect  because we are not helping  we are not working for society  but we are working for privileged people  rich people  government  developers. They have money and power. Those are invisible. So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture. That is our profession  even historically it's the same  even now we are doing the same. So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society  even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters. But I must say they are no longer natural disasters. For example  earthquakes never kill people  but collapse of the buildings kill people. That's the responsibility of architects. Then people need some temporary housing  but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people. So I thought  even as architects  we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing. We can make it better. So that is why I started working in disaster areas.       there was a big disaster in Rwanda  Africa. Two tribes  Hutu and Tutsi  fought each other. Over two million people became refugees. But I was so surprised to see the shelter  refugee camp organized by the U.N. They're so poor  and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season  In the shelters built by the U.N.  they were just providing a plastic sheet  and the refugees had to cut the trees  and just like this. But over two million people cut trees. It just became big  heavy deforestation and an environmental problem. That is why they started providing aluminum pipes  aluminum barracks. Very expensive  they throw them out for money  then cutting trees again. So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong  but my budget is only    U.S. dollars per unit. We built    units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites  so on. And then  year afterward        in Kobe  Japan  we had a big earthquake. Nearly       people were killed  and the city like this Nagata district  all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake. And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church    all the building was totally destroyed. So I went there and also I proposed to the priests   Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes   And he said   Oh God  are you crazy  After a fire  what are you proposing   So he never trusted me  but I didn't give up. I started commuting to Kobe  and I met the society of Vietnamese people. They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park. So I proposed to rebuild. I raised    did fundraising. I made a paper tube shelter for them  and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish  I used beer crates as a foundation. I asked the Kirin beer company to propose  because at that time  the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red  which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes. The color coordination is very important. And also I still remember  we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate  but it came empty.  Laughter  So I remember it was so disappointing. So during the summer with my students  we built over    units of the shelters. Finally the priest  finally he trusted me to rebuild. He said   As long as you collect money by yourself  bring your students to build  you can do it.  So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church. It was meant to stay there for three years  but actually it stayed there    years because people loved it. Then  in Taiwan  they had a big earthquake  and we proposed to donate this church  so we dismantled them  we sent them over to be built by volunteer people. It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now. So this building became a permanent building. Then I wonder  what is a permanent and what is a temporary building  Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it. Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money. In       in Turkey  the big earthquake  I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.       in West India  I built also a shelter. In       in Sri Lanka  after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami  I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages. And in       in Chengdu  Sichuan area in China  nearly        people were killed  and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor. I was asked to rebuild the temporary church. I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students. In one month  we completed nine classrooms  over     square meters. It's still used  even after the current earthquake in China. In       in Italy  L'Aquila  also they had a big earthquake. And this is a very interesting photo  former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso    you know  because we have to change the prime minister ever year. And they are very kind  affording my model. I proposed a big rebuilding  a temporary music hall  because L'Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed  so musicians were moving out. So I proposed to the mayor  I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium. He said   As long as you bring your money  you can do it.  And I was very lucky. Mr. Berlusconi brought G  summit  and our former prime minister came  so they helped us to collect money  and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium. Year      in Haiti  there was a big earthquake  but it's impossible to fly over  so I went to Santo Domingo  next door country  to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build    units of shelter out of local paper tubes. This is what happened in Japan two years ago  in northern Japan. After the earthquake and tsunami  people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium. But look at this. There's no privacy. People suffer mentally and physically. So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes  just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain. However  some of the facility authority doesn't want us to do it  because  they said  simply  it's become more difficult to control them. But it's really necessary to do it. They don't have enough flat area to build standard government single story housing like this one. Look at this. Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing  so dense and so messy because there is no storage  nothing  water is leaking  so I thought  we have to make multi story building because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable. So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions. Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi. He asked me to build three story housing on baseball  fields . I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable  within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same  but much more comfortable. Many of the people want to stay here forever. I was very happy to hear that. Now I am working in New Zealand  Christchurch. About    days before the Japanese earthquake happened  also they had a big earthquake  and many Japanese students were also killed  and the most important cathedral of the city  the symbol of Christchurch  was totally destroyed. And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral. So this is under construction. And I'd like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  What I'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects  and that is the neuroscience of sleep. Now  there is a sound    Ah  it worked  A sound that is desperately familiar to most of us  and of course it's the sound of the alarm clock. And what that truly ghastly  awful sound does is stop the single most important behavioral experience that we have  and that's sleep. If you're an average sort of person     percent of your life will be spent asleep  which means that if you live to     then    years will have been spent entirely asleep. Now what that    years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important. And yet  for most of us  we don't give sleep a second thought. We throw it away. We really just don't think about sleep. And so what I'd like to do today is change your views  change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep. And the journey that I want to take you on  we need to start by going back in time.  Enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber.  Any ideas who said that  Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Yes  let me give you a few more quotes.  O sleep  O gentle sleep  nature's soft nurse  how have I frighted thee   Shakespeare again  from    I won't say it    the Scottish play. From the same time   Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.  Extremely prophetic  by Thomas Dekker  another Elizabethan dramatist. But if we jump forward     years  the tone about sleep changes somewhat. This is from Thomas Edison  from the beginning of the   th century   Sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days.  Bang  And if we also jump into the     s  some of you may remember that Margaret Thatcher was reported to have said   Sleep is for wimps.  And of course the infamous    what was his name     the infamous Gordon Gekko from  Wall Street  said   Money never sleeps.  What do we do in the   th century about sleep  Well  of course  we use Thomas Edison's light bulb to invade the night  and we occupied the dark  and in the process of this occupation  we've treated sleep as an illness  almost. We've treated it as an enemy. At most now  I suppose  we tolerate the need for sleep  and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep as an illness that needs some sort of a cure. And our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound. Why is it  Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts  Well  it's because you don't do anything much while you're asleep  it seems. You don't eat. You don't drink. And you don't have sex. Well  most of us anyway. And so  therefore it's    Sorry. It's a complete waste of time  right  Wrong. Actually  sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology  and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it's so very important. So let's move to the brain. Now  here we have a brain. This is donated by a social scientist  and they said they didn't know what it was or indeed  how to use it  so    Sorry. So I borrowed it. I don't think they noticed. OK. The point I'm trying to make is that when you're asleep  this thing doesn't shut down. In fact  some areas of the brain are actually more active during the sleep state than during the wake state. The other thing that's really important about sleep is that it doesn't arise from a single structure within the brain  but is to some extent a network property. If we flip the brain on its back    I love this little bit of spinal cord here    this bit here is the hypothalamus  and right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures  not least the biological clock. The biological clock tells us when it's good to be up  when it's good to be asleep  and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus  the lateral hypothalamus  the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei. All of those combine  and they send projections down to the brain stem here. The brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex  this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here  with neurotransmitters that keep us awake and essentially provide us with our consciousness. So sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions within the brain  and essentially  sleep is turned on and off as a result of a range of interactions in here. OK. So where have we got to  We've said that sleep is complicated and it takes    years of our life. But what I haven't explained is what sleep is about. So why do we sleep  And it won't surprise any of you that  of course  as scientists  we don't have a consensus. There are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep  and I'm going to outline three of those. The first is sort of the restoration idea  and it's somewhat intuitive. Essentially  all the stuff we've burned up during the day  we restore  we replace  we rebuild during the night. And indeed  as an explanation  it goes back to Aristotle  so that's what          years ago. It's gone in and out of fashion. It's fashionable at the moment because what's been shown is that within the brain  a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep  and those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways. So there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis. What about energy conservation  Again  perhaps intuitive. You essentially sleep to save calories. Now  when you do the sums  though  it doesn't really pan out. If you compare an individual who has slept at night  or stayed awake and hasn't moved very much  the energy saving of sleeping is about     calories a night. Now  that's the equivalent of a hot dog bun. Now  I would say that a hot dog bun is kind of a meager return for such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep. So I'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea. But the third idea I'm quite attracted to  which is brain processing and memory consolidation. What we know is that  if after you've tried to learn a task  and you sleep deprive individuals  the ability to learn that task is smashed. It's really hugely attenuated. So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important. However  it's not just the laying down of memory and recalling it. What's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep. In fact  it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage. Sleeping at night enhances our creativity. And what seems to be going on is that  in the brain  those neural connections that are important  those synaptic connections that are important  are linked and strengthened  while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important. OK. So we've had three explanations for why we might sleep  and I think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary  and it's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons. But sleep is not an indulgence. It's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually. I think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade from economy to business class  you know  the equivalent of. It's not even an upgrade from economy to first class. The critical thing to realize is that if you don't sleep  you don't fly. Essentially  you never get there. And what's extraordinary about much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleep deprived. So let's now look at sleep deprivation. Huge sectors of society are sleep deprived  and let's look at our sleep o meter. So in the     s  good data suggests that most of us were getting around eight hours of sleep a night. Nowadays  we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night  so we're in the six and a half hours every night league. For teenagers  it's worse  much worse. They need nine hours for full brain performance  and many of them  on a school night  are only getting five hours of sleep. It's simply not enough. If we think about other sectors of society    the aged  if you are aged  then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted  and many sleep  again  less than five hours a night. Shift work. Shift work is extraordinary  perhaps    percent of the working population  and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night. It's locked onto the same light dark cycle as the rest of us. So when the poor old shift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day  desperately tired  the body clock is saying   Wake up. This is the time to be awake.  So the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor  again in that sort of five hour region. And then  of course  tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag. So who here has jet lag  Well  my goodness gracious. Well  thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep  because that's what your brain is craving. One of the things that the brain does is indulge in micro sleeps  this involuntary falling asleep  and you have essentially no control over it. Now  micro sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing  but they can also be deadly. It's been estimated that    percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life  and in the US  the statistics are pretty good          accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness  loss of vigilance  and falling asleep    a hundred thousand a year. It's extraordinary. At another level of terror  we dip into the tragic accidents at Chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle Challenger  which was so tragically lost. And in the investigations that followed those disasters  poor judgment as a result of extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk of those disasters. When you're tired and you lack sleep  you have poor memory  you have poor creativity  you have increased impulsiveness  and you have overall poor judgment. But my friends  it's so much worse than that. If you are a tired brain  the brain is craving things to wake it up. So drugs  stimulants. Caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across much of the Western world. Much of the day is fueled by caffeine  and if you're a really naughty tired brain  nicotine. Of course  you're fueling the waking state with these stimulants  and then  of course  it gets to    o'clock at night  and the brain says to itself   Actually  I need to be asleep fairly shortly. What do we do about that when I'm feeling completely wired   Well  of course  you then resort to alcohol. Now alcohol  short term  you know  once or twice  to use to mildly sedate you  can be very useful. It can actually ease the sleep transition. But what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep. A biological mimic for sleep  it sedates you. So it actually harms some of the neural processing that's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall. So it's a short term acute measure  but for goodness sake  don't become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night. Another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain. If you sleep around about five hours or less every night  then you have a    percent likelihood of being obese. What's the connection here  Well  sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin  the hunger hormone. Ghrelin is released. It gets to the brain. The brain says   I need carbohydrates   and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars. So there's a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain  stress. Tired people are massively stressed. And one of the things of stress  of course  is loss of memory  which is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of. But stress is so much more. So  if you're acutely stressed  not a great problem  but it's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that's the problem. Sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity. And so  tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection  and there's some very good studies showing that shift workers  for example  have higher rates of cancer. Increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation. Glucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature and essentially you become glucose intolerant. Therefore  diabetes  . Stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure. So there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss that are more than just a mildly impaired brain  which is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides. So at this point in the talk  this is a nice time to think   Well  do you think on the whole I'm getting enough sleep   So a quick show of hands. Who feels that they're getting enough sleep here  Oh. Well  that's pretty impressive. Good. We'll talk more about that later  about what are your tips. So most of us  of course  ask the question   How do I know whether I'm getting enough sleep   Well  it's not rocket science. If you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning  if you are taking a long time to get up  if you need lots of stimulants  if you're grumpy  if you're irritable  if you're told by your work colleagues that you're looking tired and irritable  chances are you are sleep deprived. Listen to them. Listen to yourself. What do you do  Well    and this is slightly offensive    sleep for dummies. Make your bedroom a haven for sleep. The first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can  and also make it slightly cool. Very important. Actually  reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed. Light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep. What's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed  We stand in a massively lit bathroom  looking into the mirror cleaning our teeth. It's the worst thing we can possibly do before we go to sleep. Turn off those mobile phones. Turn off those computers. Turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain. Try not to drink caffeine too late in the day  ideally not after lunch. Now  we've set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed  but light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological clock to the light dark cycle. So seek out morning light. Basically  listen to yourself. Wind down. Do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the honey heavy dew of slumber. OK. That's some facts. What about some myths  Teenagers are lazy. No. Poor things. They have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late  so give them a break. We need eight hours of sleep a night. That's an average. Some people need more. Some people need less. And what you need to do is listen to your body. Do you need that much or do you need more  Simple as that. Old people need less sleep. Not true. The sleep demands of the aged do not go down. Essentially  sleep fragments and becomes less robust  but sleep requirements do not go down. And the fourth myth is early to bed  early to rise makes a man healthy  wealthy and wise. Well  that's wrong at so many different levels. There is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all. There's no difference in socioeconomic status. In my experience  the only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug. OK. So for the last few minutes  what I want to do is change gears and talk about some really new  breaking areas of neuroscience  which is the association between mental health  mental illness and sleep disruption. We've known for     years that in severe mental illness  there is always  always sleep disruption  but it's been largely ignored. In the     s  when people started to think about this again  they said   Yes  well  of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia  because they're on antipsychotics. It's the antipsychotics causing the sleep problems   ignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously  sleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics. So what's going on  Several groups are studying conditions like depression  schizophrenia and bipolar and what's going on in terms of sleep disruption. We have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia  and the data were quite extraordinary. In those individuals with schizophrenia  much of the time  they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day. Other groups showed no    hour patterns whatsoever    their sleep was absolutely smashed. And some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light dark cycle. They were getting up later and later and later and later each night. It was smashed. So what's going on  And the really exciting news is that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated  but they are physically linked within the brain. The neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep  give you normal sleep  and those that give you normal mental health  are overlapping. And what's the evidence for that  Well  genes that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal sleep  when mutated  when changed  also predispose individuals to mental health problems. And last year  we published a study which showed that a gene that's been linked to schizophrenia  when mutated  also smashes the sleep. So we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems. Other work flowed from these studies. The first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types of mental illness  and we've shown that in those young individuals who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder  they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical diagnosis of bipolar. The other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate  make worse  the mental illness state. My colleague Dan Freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by    percent. So what have we got  We've got  in these connections  some really exciting things. In terms of the neuroscience  by understanding these two systems  we're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain. The second area is that if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal  then we have the chance of going in. If we know these individuals are vulnerable  early intervention then becomes possible. And the third  which I think is the most exciting  is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target. Stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable  we can certainly make them healthier  but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness. So let me just finish. What I started by saying is  Take sleep seriously. Our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre industrial age  when we were almost wrapped in a duvet. We used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep. And this isn't some sort of crystal waving nonsense. This is a pragmatic response to good health. If you have good sleep  it increases your concentration  attention  decision making  creativity  social skills  health. If you get sleep  it reduces your mood changes  your stress  your levels of anger  your impulsivity  and your tendency to drink and take drugs. And we finished by saying that an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep is really informing the way we think about some of the causes of mental illness  and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions. Jim Butcher  the fantasy writer  said   Sleep is God. Go worship.  And I can only recommend that you do the same. Thank you for your attention. Steve Ramirez  My first year of grad school  I found myself in my bedroom eating lots of Ben   Jerry's watching some trashy TV and maybe  maybe listening to Taylor Swift. I had just gone through a breakup. So for the longest time  all I would do is recall the memory of this person over and over again  wishing that I could get rid of that gut wrenching  visceral  blah  feeling. Now  as it turns out  I'm a neuroscientist  so I knew that the memory of that person and the awful  emotional undertones that color in that memory  are largely mediated by separate brain systems. And so I thought  what if we could go into the brain and edit out that nauseating feeling but while keeping the memory of that person intact  Then I realized  maybe that's a little bit lofty for now. So what if we could start off by going into the brain and just finding a single memory to begin with  Could we jump start that memory back to life  maybe even play with the contents of that memory  All that said  there is one person in the entire world right now that I really hope is not watching this talk. So there is a catch. There is a catch. These ideas probably remind you of  Total Recall    Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind   or of  Inception.  But the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab. Xu Liu  Test mice. As neuroscientists  we work in the lab with mice trying to understand how memory works. And today  we hope to convince you that now we are actually able to activate a memory in the brain at the speed of light. To do this  there's only two simple steps to follow. First  you find and label a memory in the brain  and then you activate it with a switch. As simple as that. SR  Are you convinced  So  turns out finding a memory in the brain isn't all that easy. XL  Indeed. This is way more difficult than  let's say  finding a needle in a haystack  because at least  you know  the needle is still something you can physically put your fingers on. But memory is not. And also  there's way more cells in your brain than the number of straws in a typical haystack. So yeah  this task does seem to be daunting. But luckily  we got help from the brain itself. It turned out that all we need to do is basically to let the brain form a memory  and then the brain will tell us which cells are involved in that particular memory. SR  So what was going on in my brain while I was recalling the memory of an ex  If you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now  you would see that there was an amazing number of brain regions that were active while recalling that memory. Now one brain region that would be robustly active in particular is called the hippocampus  which for decades has been implicated in processing the kinds of memories that we hold near and dear  which also makes it an ideal target to go into and to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory. XL  When you zoom in into the hippocampus  of course you will see lots of cells  but we are able to find which cells are involved in a particular memory  because whenever a cell is active  like when it's forming a memory  it will also leave a footprint that will later allow us to know these cells are recently active. SR  So the same way that building lights at night let you know that somebody's probably working there at any given moment  in a very real sense  there are biological sensors within a cell that are turned on only when that cell was just working. They're sort of biological windows that light up to let us know that that cell was just active. XL  So we clipped part of this sensor  and attached that to a switch to control the cells  and we packed this switch into an engineered virus and injected that into the brain of the mice. So whenever a memory is being formed  any active cells for that memory will also have this switch installed. SR  So here is what the hippocampus looks like after forming a fear memory  for example. The sea of blue that you see here are densely packed brain cells  but the green brain cells  the green brain cells are the ones that are holding on to a specific fear memory. So you are looking at the crystallization of the fleeting formation of fear. You're actually looking at the cross section of a memory right now. XL  Now  for the switch we have been talking about  ideally  the switch has to act really fast. It shouldn't take minutes or hours to work. It should act at the speed of the brain  in milliseconds. SR  So what do you think  Xu  Could we use  let's say  pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells  XL  Nah. Drugs are pretty messy. They spread everywhere. And also it takes them forever to act on cells. So it will not allow us to control a memory in real time. So Steve  how about let's zap the brain with electricity  SR  So electricity is pretty fast  but we probably wouldn't be able to target it to just the specific cells that hold onto a memory  and we'd probably fry the brain. XL  Oh. That's true. So it looks like  hmm  indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light. SR  So it just so happens that light travels at the speed of light. So maybe we could activate or inactive memories by just using light    XL  That's pretty fast. SR     and because normally brain cells don't respond to pulses of light  so those that would respond to pulses of light are those that contain a light sensitive switch. Now to do that  first we need to trick brain cells to respond to laser beams. XL  Yep. You heard it right. We are trying to shoot lasers into the brain. SR  And the technique that lets us do that is optogenetics. Optogenetics gave us this light switch that we can use to turn brain cells on or off  and the name of that switch is channelrhodopsin  seen here as these green dots attached to this brain cell. You can think of channelrhodopsin as a sort of light sensitive switch that can be artificially installed in brain cells so that now we can use that switch to activate or inactivate the brain cell simply by clicking it  and in this case we click it on with pulses of light. XL  So we attach this light sensitive switch of channelrhodopsin to the sensor we've been talking about and inject this into the brain. So whenever a memory is being formed  any active cell for that particular memory will also have this light sensitive switch installed in it so that we can control these cells by the flipping of a laser just like this one you see. SR  So let's put all of this to the test now. What we can do is we can take our mice and then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here  and then we can give them a very mild foot shock so that they form a fear memory of this box. They learn that something bad happened here. Now with our system  the cells that are active in the hippocampus in the making of this memory  only those cells will now contain channelrhodopsin. XL  When you are as small as a mouse  it feels as if the whole world is trying to get you. So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected. Whenever a mouse is in fear  it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box  trying to not move any part of its body  and this posture is called freezing. So if a mouse remembers that something bad happened in this box  and when we put them back into the same box  it will basically show freezing because it doesn't want to be detected by any potential threats in this box. SR  So you can think of freezing as  you're walking down the street minding your own business  and then out of nowhere you almost run into an ex girlfriend or ex boyfriend  and now those terrifying two seconds where you start thinking   What do I do  Do I say hi  Do I shake their hand  Do I turn around and run away  Do I sit here and pretend like I don't exist   Those kinds of fleeting thoughts that physically incapacitate you  that temporarily give you that deer in headlights look. XL  However  if you put the mouse in a completely different new box  like the next one  it will not be afraid of this box because there's no reason that it will be afraid of this new environment. But what if we put the mouse in this new box but at the same time  we activate the fear memory using lasers just like we did before  Are we going to bring back the fear memory for the first box into this completely new environment  SR  All right  and here's the million dollar experiment. Now to bring back to life the memory of that day  I remember that the Red Sox had just won  it was a green spring day  perfect for going up and down the river and then maybe going to the North End to get some cannolis   justsaying. Now Xu and I  on the other hand  were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen. We were looking at this mouse here trying to activate a memory for the first time using our technique. XL  And this is what we saw. When we first put the mouse into this box  it's exploring  sniffing around  walking around  minding its own business  because actually by nature  mice are pretty curious animals. They want to know  what's going on in this new box  It's interesting. But the moment we turned on the laser  like you see now  all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode. It stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body. Clearly it's freezing. So indeed  it looks like we are able to bring back the fear memory for the first box in this completely new environment. While watching this  Steve and I are as shocked as the mouse itself. So after the experiment  the two of us just left the room without saying anything. After a kind of long  awkward period of time  Steve broke the silence. SR   Did that just work   XL   Yes   I said.  Indeed it worked   We're really excited about this. And then we published our findings in the journal Nature. Ever since the publication of our work  we've been receiving numerous comments from all over the Internet. Maybe we can take a look at some of those.   OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come  virtual reality  neural manipulation  visual dream emulation... neural coding  'writing and re writing of memories'  mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome   SR  So the first thing that you'll notice is that people have really strong opinions about this kind of work. Now I happen to completely agree with the optimism of this first quote  because on a scale of zero to Morgan Freeman's voice  it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that I've heard come our way. But as you'll see  it's not the only opinion that's out there.   This scares the hell out of me... What if they could do that easily in humans in a couple of years   OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOMED   XL  Indeed  if we take a look at the second one  I think we can all agree that it's  meh  probably not as positive. But this also reminds us that  although we are still working with mice  it's probably a good idea to start thinking and discussing about the possible ethical ramifications of memory control. SR  Now  in the spirit of the third quote  we want to tell you about a recent project that we've been working on in lab that we've called Project Inception.   They should make a movie about this. Where they plant ideas into peoples minds  so they can control them for their own personal gain. We'll call it  Inception.   So we reasoned that now that we can reactivate a memory  what if we do so but then begin to tinker with that memory  Could we possibly even turn it into a false memory  XL  So all memory is sophisticated and dynamic  but if just for simplicity  let's imagine memory as a movie clip. So far what we've told you is basically we can control this  play  button of the clip so that we can play this video clip any time  anywhere. But is there a possibility that we can actually get inside the brain and edit this movie clip so that we can make it different from the original  Yes we can. Turned out that all we need to do is basically reactivate a memory using lasers just like we did before  but at the same time  if we present new information and allow this new information to incorporate into this old memory  this will change the memory. It's sort of like making a remix tape. SR  So how do we do this  Rather than finding a fear memory in the brain  we can start by taking our animals  and let's say we put them in a blue box like this blue box here and we find the brain cells that represent that blue box and we trick them to respond to pulses of light exactly like we had said before. Now the next day  we can take our animals and place them in a red box that they've never experienced before. We can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box. So what would happen here if  while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box  we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks  So here we're trying to artificially make an association between the memory of the blue box and the foot shocks themselves. We're just trying to connect the two. So to test if we had done so  we can take our animals once again and place them back in the blue box. Again  we had just reactivated the memory of the blue box while the animal got a couple of mild foot shocks  and now the animal suddenly freezes. It's as though it's recalling being mildly shocked in this environment even though that never actually happened. So it formed a false memory  because it's falsely fearing an environment where  technically speaking  nothing bad actually happened to it. XL  So  so far we are only talking about this light controlled  on  switch. In fact  we also have a light controlled  off  switch  and it's very easy to imagine that by installing this light controlled  off  switch  we can also turn off a memory  any time  anywhere. So everything we've been talking about today is based on this philosophically charged principle of neuroscience that the mind  with its seemingly mysterious properties  is actually made of physical stuff that we can tinker with. SR  And for me personally  I see a world where we can reactivate any kind of memory that we'd like. I also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories. Now  I even see a world where editing memories is something of a reality  because we're living in a time where it's possible to pluck questions from the tree of science fiction and to ground them in experimental reality. XL  Nowadays  people in the lab and people in other groups all over the world are using similar methods to activate or edit memories  whether that's old or new  positive or negative  all sorts of memories so that we can understand how memory works. SR  For example  one group in our lab was able to find the brain cells that make up a fear memory and converted them into a pleasurable memory  just like that. That's exactly what I mean about editing these kinds of processes. Now one dude in lab was even able to reactivate memories of female mice in male mice  which rumor has it is a pleasurable experience. XL  Indeed  we are living in a very exciting moment where science doesn't have any arbitrary speed limits but is only bound by our own imagination. SR  And finally  what do we make of all this  How do we push this technology forward  These are the questions that should not remain just inside the lab  and so one goal of today's talk was to bring everybody up to speed with the kind of stuff that's possible in modern neuroscience  but now  just as importantly  to actively engage everybody in this conversation. So let's think together as a team about what this all means and where we can and should go from here  because Xu and I think we all have some really big decisions ahead of us. Thank you. XL  Thank you. I come from Lebanon  and I believe that running can change the world. I know what I have just said is simply not obvious. You know  Lebanon as a country has been once destroyed by a long and bloody civil war. Honestly  I don't know why they call it civil war when there is nothing civil about it. With Syria to the north  Israel and Palestine to the south  and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable. For years  the country has been divided between politics and religion. However  for one day a year  we truly stand united  and that's when the marathon takes place. I used to be a marathon runner. Long distance running was not only good for my well being but it helped me meditate and dream big. So the longer distances I ran  the bigger my dreams became. Until one fateful morning  and while training  I was hit by a bus. I nearly died  was in a coma  stayed at the hospital for two years  and underwent    surgeries to be able to walk again. As soon as I came out of my coma  I realized that I was no longer the same runner I used to be  so I decided  if I couldn't run myself  I wanted to make sure that others could. So out of my hospital bed  I asked my husband to start taking notes  and a few months later  the marathon was born. Organizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident may sound strange  but at that time  even during my most vulnerable condition  I needed to dream big. I needed something to take me out of my pain  an objective to look forward to. I didn't want to pity myself  nor to be pitied  and I thought by organizing such a marathon  I'll be able to pay back to my community  build bridges with the outside world  and invite runners to come to Lebanon and run under the umbrella of peace. Organizing a marathon in Lebanon is definitely not like organizing one in New York. How do you introduce the concept of running to a nation that is constantly at the brink of war  How do you ask those who were once fighting and killing each other to come together and run next to each other  More than that  how do you convince people to run a distance of   .  miles at a time they were not even familiar with the word  marathon   So we had to start from scratch. For almost two years  we went all over the country and even visited remote villages. I personally met with people from all walks of life    mayors  NGOs  schoolchildren  politicians  militiamen  people from mosques  churches  the president of the country  even housewives. I learned one thing  When you walk the talk  people believe you. Many were touched by my personal story  and they shared their stories in return. It was honesty and transparency that brought us together. We spoke one common language to each other  and that was from one human to another. Once that trust was built  everybody wanted to be part of the marathon to show the world the true colors of Lebanon and the Lebanese and their desire to live in peace and harmony. In October       over       runners from    different nationalities came to the start line  all determined  and when the gunfire went off  this time it was a signal to run in harmony  for a change. The marathon grew. So did our political problems. But for every disaster we had  the marathon found ways to bring people together. In       our prime minister was assassinated  and the country came to a complete standstill  so we organized a five kilometer United We Run campaign. Over        people came to the start line  all wearing white T shirts with no political slogans. That was a turning point for the marathon  where people started looking at it as a platform for peace and unity. Between      up to       our country  Lebanon  went through unstable years  invasions  and more assassinations that brought us close to a civil war. The country was divided again  so much that our parliament resigned  we had no president for a year  and no prime minister. But we did have a marathon. So through the marathon  we learned that political problems can be overcome. When the opposition party decided to shut down part of the city center  we negotiated alternative routes. Government protesters became sideline cheerleaders. They even hosted juice stations. You know  the marathon has really become one of its kind. It gained credibility from both the Lebanese and the international community. Last November       over        runners from    different nationalities came to the start line  but this time  they challenged a very stormy and rainy weather. The streets were flooded  but people didn't want to miss out on the opportunity of being part of such a national day. BMA has expanded. We include everyone  the young  the elderly  the disabled  the mentally challenged  the blind  the elite  the amateur runners  even moms with their babies. Themes have included runs for the environment  breast cancer  for the love of Lebanon  for peace  or just simply to run. The first annual all women and girls race for empowerment  which is one of its kind in the region  has just taken place only a few weeks ago  with       women  including the first lady  and this is only the beginning. Thank you. BMA has supported charities and volunteers who have helped reshape Lebanon  raising funds for their causes and encouraging others to give. The culture of giving and doing good has become contagious. Stereotypes have been broken. Change makers and future leaders have been created. I believe these are the building blocks for future peace. BMA has become such a respected event in the region that government officials in the region  like Iraq  Egypt and Syria  have asked the organization to help them structure a similar sporting event. We are now one of the largest running events in the Middle East  but most importantly  it is a platform for hope and cooperation in an ever fragile and unstable part of the world. From Boston to Beirut  we stand as one. After    years in Lebanon  from national marathons or from national events to smaller regional races  we've seen that people want to run for a better future. After all  peacemaking is not a sprint. It is more of a marathon. Thank you. Ah yes  those university days  a heady mix of Ph.D level pure mathematics and world debating championships  or  as I like to say   Hello  ladies. Oh yeah.  Didn't get much sexier than the Spence at university  let me tell you. It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer from Sydney  Australia  to be here on the TED stage literally on the other side of the world. And I wanted to let you know  a lot of the things you've heard about Australians are true. From the youngest of ages  we display a prodigious sporting talent. On the field of battle  we are brave and noble warriors. What you've heard is true. Australians  we don't mind a bit of a drink  sometimes to excess  leading to embarrassing social situations.  Laughter  This is my father's work Christmas party  December     . I'm almost five years old. Fair to say  I'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was. But I stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host  not as a comedian  but as someone who was  is  and always will be a mathematician. And anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep. I cast my mind back when I was in second grade at a beautiful little government run school called Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney  and as we came up towards lunchtime  our teacher  Ms. Russell  said to the class   Hey  year two. What do you want to do after lunch  I've got no plans.  It was an exercise in democratic schooling  and I am all for democratic schooling  but we were only seven. So some of the suggestions we made as to what we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical  and after a while  someone made a particularly silly suggestion and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism   That wouldn't work. That'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole.  Now I wasn't trying to be smart. I wasn't trying to be funny. I just politely raised my hand  and when Ms. Russell acknowledged me  I said  in front of my year two classmates  and I quote   But Miss  surely if the diagonal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle  well  the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole.   It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop  wouldn't it   And there was that same awkward silence from most of my classmates  until sitting next to me  one of my friends  one of the cool kids in class  Steven  leaned across and punched me really hard in the head. Now what Steven was saying was   Look  Adam  you are at a critical juncture in your life here  my friend. You can keep sitting here with us. Any more of that sort of talk  you've got to go and sit over there with them.  I thought about it for a nanosecond. I took one look at the road map of life  and I ran off down the street marked  Geek  as fast as my chubby  asthmatic little legs would carry me. I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages. I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful. It's natural. It's everywhere. Numbers are the musical notes with which the symphony of the universe is written. The great Descartes said something quite similar. The universe  is written in the mathematical language.  And today  I want to show you one of those musical notes  a number so beautiful  so massive  I think it will blow your mind. Today we're going to talk about prime numbers. Most of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime because it's   x  . Seven is prime because it's   x    but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks  or as we call them  factors. Now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers. One is not prime. The proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties. Another thing about primes  there is no final biggest prime number. They keep going on forever. We know there are an infinite number of primes due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid. Over thousands of years ago  he proved that for us. But the third thing about prime numbers  mathematicians have always wondered  well at any given moment in time  what is the biggest prime that we know about  Today we're going to hunt for that massive prime. Don't freak out. All you need to know  of all the mathematics you've ever learned  unlearned  crammed  forgotten  never understood in the first place  all you need to know is this  When I say        I'm talking about five little number twos next to each other all multiplied together    x   x   x   x  . So       is   x                 . If you've got that  you're with me for the entire journey. Okay  So        those five little twos multiplied together.    is a prime number  and that five in the power is also a prime number. And the vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found are of that form  two to a prime number  take away one. I won't go into great detail as to why  because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do  but suffice to say  a number of that form is fairly easy to test for primacy. A random odd number is a lot harder to test. But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes  we realize it's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power. and you don't need me to tell you that's    x   . But                            After that point  they thin out a lot. And one of the things about the search for massive primes that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds of all time have gone on this search. This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. In the     s  other mathematicians said he is simply the master of us all. He was so respected  they put him on European currency back when that was a compliment. Euler discovered at the time the world's biggest prime  It's over two billion. He proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill  ink  paper and his mind. You think that's big. We know that               is a prime number. It's an absolute brute. Look at it here     digits long  proven to be prime in      by a mathematician called Lucas. Word up  L Dog. But one of the great things about the search for massive primes  it's not just finding the primes. Sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting. Lucas again  in       showed us                  digits long  was not prime. But he didn't know what the factors were. We knew it was like six  but we didn't know what are the   x   that multiply together to give us that massive number. We didn't know for almost    years until Frank Nelson Cole came along. And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians  he walked to the board  took up a piece of chalk  and started writing out the powers of two  two  four  eight        come on  join in with me  you know how it goes                                       . I'm in geek heaven. We'll stop it there for a second. Frank Nelson Cole did not stop there. He went on and on and calculated    powers of two. He took away one and wrote that number on the board. A frisson of excitement went around the room. It got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format    and for the rest of the hour of his talk Frank Nelson Cole busted that out. He had found the prime factors of             . The room went berserk    as Frank Nelson Cole sat down  having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words. He admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do. It took focus. It took dedication. It took him  by his estimate   three years of Sundays.  But then in the field of mathematics  as in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED  the age of the computer goes along and things explode. These are the largest prime numbers we knew decade by decade  each one dwarfing the one before as computers took over and our power to calculate just grew and grew. This is the largest prime number we knew in       a very emotional year for me. It was the year I left university. I was torn between mathematics and media. It was a tough decision. I loved university. My arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life. But I came to a realization about my own ability. Put simply  in a room full of randomly selected people  I'm a maths genius. In a roomful of maths Ph.Ds  I'm as dumb as a box of hammers. My skill is not in the mathematics. It is in telling the story of the mathematics. And during that time  since I've left university  these numbers have got bigger and bigger  each one dwarfing the last  until along came this man  Dr. Curtis Cooper  who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime  only to see it snatched away by a rival university. And then Curtis Cooper got it back. Not years ago  not months ago  days ago. In an amazing moment of serendipity  I had to send TED a new slide to show you what this guy had done. I still remember     Applause     I still remember when it happened. I was doing my breakfast radio show. I looked down on Twitter. There was a tweet   Adam  have you seen the new largest prime number   I shivered    contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room  and said  Girls  hold the front page. We're not talking politics today. We're not talking sport today. They found another megaprime.  The girls just shook their heads  put them in their hands  and let me go my own way. It's because of Curtis Cooper that we know  currently the largest prime number we know  is               . Don't forget to subtract the one. This number is almost    and a half million digits long. If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file  that's    meg. For the slightly less geeky of you  think about the Harry Potter novels  okay  This is the first Harry Potter novel. This is all seven Harry Potter novels  because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end. Written out as a book  this number would run the length of the Harry Potter novels and half again. Here's a slide of the first       digits of this prime. If  when TED had begun  at    o'clock on Tuesday  we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second  it would have taken five hours to show you that number. I was keen to do it  could not convince Bono. That's the way it goes. This number is    and a half thousand slides long  and we know it is prime as confidently as we know the number seven is prime. That fills me with almost sexual excitement. And who am I kidding when I say almost  I know what you're thinking  Adam  we're happy that you're happy  but why should we care  Let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful. First of all  as I explained  to ask a computer  Is that number prime   to type it in its abbreviated form  and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy  is a remarkably simple question to ask. It's got a remarkably clear yes no answer  and just requires phenomenal grunt. Large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips. But secondly  as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime  he wasn't the only guy searching. My laptop at home was looking through four potential candidate primes myself as part of a networked computer hunt around the world for these large numbers. The discovery of that prime is similar to the work people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences  in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects. We live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia but on laptops  desktops  in the palms of people's hands who are simply helping out for the search. But for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor for the time in which we live  when human minds and machines can conquer together. We've heard a lot about robots in this TED. We've heard a lot about what they can and can't do. It is true  you can now download onto your smartphone an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess. You think that's cool. Here's a machine doing something cool. This is the CubeStormer II. It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube. Using the power of the smartphone  it can examine the cube and solve the cube in five seconds. That scares some people. That excites me. How lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together  I was asked in an interview last year in my capacity as a lower case  c  celebrity in Australia   What was your highlight of        People were expecting me to talk about my beloved Sydney Swans football team. In our beautiful  indigenous sport of Australian football  they won the equivalent of the Super Bowl. I was there. It was the most emotional  exciting day. It wasn't my highlight of     . People thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show. It might have been a politician. It might have been a breakthrough. It might have been a book I read  the arts. No  no  no. It might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done. No  it wasn't. The highlight of       so clearly  was the discovery of the Higgs boson. Give it up for the fundamental particle that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass. And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was    years ago Peter Higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions  How is it that the things that make us up have no mass  I've clearly got mass. Where does it come from  And he postulated a suggestion that there's this infinite  incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe  and as other particles go through those particles and interact  that's where they get their mass. The rest of the scientific community said   Great idea  Higgsy. We've got no idea if we could ever prove it. It's beyond our reach.  And within just    years  in his lifetime  with him sitting in the audience  we had designed the greatest machine ever to prove this incredible idea that originated just in a human mind. That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number. We thought it might be there  and we went and found it. That is the essence of being human. That is what we are all about. Or as my friend Descartes might put it  we think  therefore we are. Thank you. I have a confession to make. But first  I want you to make a little confession to me. In the past year  I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively little stress. Anyone  How about a moderate amount of stress  Who has experienced a lot of stress  Yeah. Me too. But that is not my confession. My confession is this  I am a health psychologist  and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier. But I fear that something I've been teaching for the last    years is doing more harm than good  and it has to do with stress. For years I've been telling people  stress makes you sick. It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease. Basically  I've turned stress into the enemy. But I have changed my mind about stress  and today  I want to change yours. Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress. This study tracked        adults in the United States for eight years  and they started by asking people   How much stress have you experienced in the last year   They also asked   Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health   And then they used public death records to find out who died. Okay. Some bad news first. People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a    percent increased risk of dying. But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health. People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die. In fact  they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study  including people who had relatively little stress. Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths          Americans died prematurely  not from stress  but from the belief that stress is bad for you. That is over        deaths a year. Now  if that estimate is correct  that would make believing stress is bad for you the   th largest cause of death in the United States last year  killing more people than skin cancer  HIV AIDS and homicide. You can see why this study freaked me out. Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health. So this study got me wondering  Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier  And here the science says yes. When you change your mind about stress  you can change your body's response to stress. Now to explain how this works  I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out. It's called the social stress test. You come into the laboratory  and you're told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you  and to make sure you feel the pressure  there are bright lights and a camera in your face  kind of like this. And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging  non verbal feedback  like this. Now that you're sufficiently demoralized  time for part two  a math test. And unbeknownst to you  the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it. Now we're going to all do this together. It's going to be fun. For me. Okay. I want you all to count backwards from     in increments of seven. You're going to do this out loud  as fast as you can  starting with    . Go  Go faster. Faster please. You're going too slow. Stop. Stop  stop  stop. That guy made a mistake. We are going to have to start all over again. You're not very good at this  are you  Okay  so you get the idea. If you were actually in this study  you'd probably be a little stressed out. Your heart might be pounding  you might be breathing faster  maybe breaking out into a sweat. And normally  we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure. But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized  was preparing you to meet this challenge  Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University. Before they went through the social stress test  they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful. That pounding heart is preparing you for action. If you're breathing faster  it's no problem. It's getting more oxygen to your brain. And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance  well  they were less stressed out  less anxious  more confident  but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed. Now  in a typical stress response  your heart rate goes up  and your blood vessels constrict like this. And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease. It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time. But in the study  when participants viewed their stress response as helpful  their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this. Their heart was still pounding  but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile. It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage. Over a lifetime of stressful experiences  this one biological change could be the difference between a stress induced heart attack at age    and living well into your   s. And this is really what the new science of stress reveals  that how you think about stress matters. So my goal as a health psychologist has changed. I no longer want to get rid of your stress. I want to make you better at stress. And we just did a little intervention. If you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year  we could have saved your life  because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress  you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself  this is my body helping me rise to this challenge. And when you view stress in that way  your body believes you  and your stress response becomes healthier. Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from  so we are going to do one more intervention. I want to tell you about one of the most under appreciated aspects of the stress response  and the idea is this  Stress makes you social. To understand this side of stress  we need to talk about a hormone  oxytocin  and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname  the cuddle hormone  because it's released when you hug someone. But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in. Oxytocin is a neuro hormone. It fine tunes your brain's social instincts. It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships. Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family. It enhances your empathy. It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about. Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin... to become more compassionate and caring. But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin. It's a stress hormone. Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response. It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound. And when oxytocin is released in the stress response  it is motivating you to seek support. Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel  instead of bottling it up. Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other. When life is difficult  your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you. Okay  so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier  Well  oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain. It also acts on your body  and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress. It's a natural anti inflammatory. It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress. But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart. Your heart has receptors for this hormone  and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress induced damage. This stress hormone strengthens your heart. And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support. So when you reach out to others under stress  either to seek support or to help someone else  you release more of this hormone  your stress response becomes healthier  and you actually recover faster from stress. I find this amazing  that your stress response has a built in mechanism for stress resilience  and that mechanism is human connection. I want to finish by telling you about one more study. And listen up  because this study could also save a life. This study tracked about       adults in the United States  and they ranged in age from    to     and they started the study by asking   How much stress have you experienced in the last year   They also asked   How much time have you spent helping out friends  neighbors  people in your community   And then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died. Okay  so the bad news first  For every major stressful life experience  like financial difficulties or family crisis  that increased the risk of dying by    percent. But    and I hope you are expecting a  but  by now    but that wasn't true for everyone. People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress related increase in dying. Zero. Caring created resilience. And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with others under stress  you can create resilience. Now I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life  but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress. Stress gives us access to our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others  and yes  your pounding physical heart  working so hard to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in this way  you're not just getting better at stress  you're actually making a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone. Thank you. Chris Anderson  This is kind of amazing  what you're telling us. It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy. How would that extend to advice  like  if someone is making a lifestyle choice between  say  a stressful job and a non stressful job  does it matter which way they go  It's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it  in some sense  KM  Yeah  and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort. And so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions  is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows. CA  Thank you so much  Kelly. It's pretty cool. So here's the most important economic fact of our time. We are living in an age of surging income inequality  particularly between those at the very top and everyone else. This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.  but it's a global phenomenon. It's happening in communist China  in formerly communist Russia  it's happening in India  in my own native Canada. We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies like Sweden  Finland and Germany. Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening. In the     s  the One Percent accounted for about    percent of the national income in the United States. Today  their share has more than doubled to above    percent. But what's even more striking is what's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution. The  .  percent in the U.S. today account for more than eight percent of the national income. They are where the One Percent was    years ago. Let me give you another number to put that in perspective  and this is a figure that was calculated in      by Robert Reich  the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men  Bill Gates and Warren Buffett  and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth of the bottom    percent of the U.S. population      million people. Now  as it happens  Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat  he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon  and he has his own favorite number. Buffett likes to point out that in       the combined wealth of the people on the Forbes     list    and this is the list of the     richest Americans    was     billion dollars. Just think about it. You didn't even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in     . Well  today  that figure has more than quintupled to  .  trillion  and I probably don't need to tell you that we haven't seen anything similar happen to the middle class  whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased. So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy  but we've been slow to notice it. One of the reasons  I think  is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon. Changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic. Think about what happened  after all  to the poor frog. But I think there's something else going on. Talking about income inequality  even if you're not on the Forbes     list  can make us feel uncomfortable. It feels less positive  less optimistic  to talk about how the pie is sliced than to think about how to make the pie bigger. And if you do happen to be on the Forbes     list  talking about income distribution  and inevitably its cousin  income redistribution  can be downright threatening. So we're living in the age of surging income inequality  especially at the top. What's driving it  and what can we do about it  One set of causes is political  lower taxes  deregulation  particularly of financial services  privatization  weaker legal protections for trade unions  all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very  very top. A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of  crony capitalism   political changes that benefit a group of well connected insiders but don't actually do much good for the rest of us. In practice  getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult. Think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia  for instance  or how hard it is to re regulate the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the Great Depression  or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies  including those whose motto might be  don't do evil   to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class. But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice is really  really hard  at least intellectually  it's an easy problem. After all  no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism. Indeed  this is one of those rare issues that unites the left and the right. A critique of crony capitalism is as central to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street. But if crony capitalism is  intellectually at least  the easy part of the problem  things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality. In and of themselves  these aren't too mysterious. Globalization and the technology revolution  the twin economic transformations which are changing our lives and transforming the global economy  are also powering the rise of the super rich. Just think about it. For the first time in history  if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea or a fantastic new product  you have almost instant  almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people. As a result  if you are very  very smart and very  very lucky  you can get very  very rich very  very quickly. The latest poster boy for this phenomenon is David Karp. The    year old founder of Tumblr recently sold his company to Yahoo for  .  billion dollars. Think about that for a minute   .  billion dollars     years old. It's easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields  like sports and entertainment. We can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before. But today  that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy. We have superstar technologists. We have superstar bankers. We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects. There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers. There are even  and this is my personal favorite example  superstar dentists  the most dazzling exemplar of whom is Bernard Touati  the Frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich or European born American fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution are creating this global plutocracy  what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it. And that's because  in contrast with crony capitalism  so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive. Let's start with technology. I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices. I love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium. I'm even more of a fan of globalization. This is the transformation which has lifted hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people out of poverty and into the middle class  and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world  it's made many new products affordable    who do you think built your iPhone    and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper. Think of your dishwasher or your t shirt. So what's not to like  Well  a few things. One of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy. Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur who has successfully sold that idea or that product to the global billions and become a billionaire in the process. It gets tempting at that point to use your economic nous to manipulate the rules of the global political economy in your own favor. And that's no mere hypothetical example. Think about Amazon  Apple  Google  Starbucks. These are among the world's most admired  most beloved  most innovative companies. They also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very  very significantly. And why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage  Once you have the tremendous economic power that we're seeing at the very  very top of the income distribution and the political power that inevitably entails  it becomes tempting as well to start trying to change the rules of the game in your own favor. Again  this is no mere hypothetical. It's what the Russian oligarchs did in creating the sale of the century privatization of Russia's natural resources. It's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the U.S. and the U.K. A second thing that worries me is how easily meritocratic plutocracy can become aristocracy. One way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks  and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy. That's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children. The middle class is spending more on schooling too  but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at Harvard  Stanford or MIT  the    percent is increasingly outgunned by the One Percent. The result is something that economists Alan Krueger and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve. As income inequality increases  social mobility decreases. The plutocracy may be a meritocracy  but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race. The third thing  and this is what worries me the most  is the extent to which those same largely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy also happen to be hollowing out the middle class in Western industrialized economies. Let's start with technology. Those same forces that are creating billionaires are also devouring many traditional middle class jobs. When's the last time you used a travel agent  And in contrast with the industrial revolution  the titans of our new economy aren't creating that many new jobs. At its zenith  G.M. employed hundreds of thousands  Facebook fewer than       . The same is true of globalization. For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets  it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed Western economies. The terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity. That's shown in what I consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time. Since the late     s  increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment. That means that our countries are getting richer  our companies are getting more efficient  but we're not creating more jobs and we're not paying people  as a whole  more. One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment. What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario. After all  in a totally free labor market  we could find jobs for pretty much everyone. The dystopia that worries me is a universe in which a few geniuses invent Google and its ilk and the rest of us are employed giving them massages. So when I get really depressed about all of this  I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution. After all  for all its grim  satanic mills  it worked out pretty well  didn't it  After all  all of us here are richer  healthier  taller    well  there are a few exceptions   and live longer than our ancestors in the early   th century. But it's important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society  we had to go through two depressions  the Great Depression of the     s  the Long Depression of the     s  two world wars  communist revolutions in Russia and in China  and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the West. We also  not coincidentally  went through an era of tremendous social and political inventions. We created the modern welfare state. We created public education. We created public health care. We created public pensions. We created unions. Today  we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the Industrial Revolution. To be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats  we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change. We need a new New Deal. You may want to take a closer look. There's more to this painting than meets the eye. And yes  it's an acrylic painting of a man  but I didn't paint it on canvas. I painted it directly on top of the man. What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether  and if I want to paint your portrait  I'm painting it on you  physically on you. That also means you're probably going to end up with an earful of paint  because I need to paint your ear on your ear. Everything in this scene  the person  the clothes  chairs  wall  gets covered in a mask of paint that mimics what's directly below it  and in this way  I'm able to take a three dimensional scene and make it look like a two dimensional painting. I can photograph it from any angle  and it will still look  D. There's no Photoshop here. This is just a photo of one of my three dimensional paintings. You might be wondering how I came up with this idea of turning people into paintings. But originally  this had nothing to do with either people or paint. It was about shadows. I was fascinated with the absence of light  and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed. I came up with the idea of painting shadows. I loved that I could hide within this shadow my own painted version  and it would be almost invisible until the light changed  and all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light. I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on  and I thought of my friend Bernie. But I didn't just want to paint the shadows. I also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale. I had a very specific vision of what this would look like  and as I was painting him  I made sure to follow that very closely. But something kept on flickering before my eyes. I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at. And then when I took that moment to take a step back  magic. I had turned my friend into a painting. I couldn't have foreseen that when I wanted to paint a shadow  I would pull out this whole other dimension  that I would collapse it  that I would take a painting and make it my friend and then bring him back to a painting. I was a little conflicted though  because I was so excited about what I'd found  but I was just about to graduate from college with a degree in political science  and I'd always had this dream of going to Washington  D.C.  and sitting at a desk and working in government. Why did this have to get in the way of all that  I made the tough decision of going home after graduation and not going up to Capitol Hill  but going down to my parents' basement and making it my job to learn how to paint. I had no idea where to begin. The last time I'd painted  I was    years old at summer camp  and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and practicing over and over again on that surface  because that's not what this project was about for me. It was about space and light. My early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas  like fried food. It's nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg. Even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit. It just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink. I'd put something down  and instantly it would be gone. And if I wanted to paint on people  well  I was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that I spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast. It just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself. One of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only didn't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his ears  but he also didn't really have much embarrassment about being taken out into very public places for exhibition  like the Metro. I was having so much fun with this process. I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles  and I wanted to see what else I could do with it. I came together with a collaborator  Sheila Vand  and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface  and that was milk. We got a pool. We filled it with milk. We filled it with Sheila. And I began painting. And the images were always completely unexpected in the end  because I could have a very specific image about how it would turn out  I could paint it to match that  but the moment that Sheila laid back into the milk  everything would change. It was in constant flux  and we had to  rather than fight it  embrace it  see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better. Sometimes  when Sheila would lay down in the milk  it would wash all the paint off of her arms  and it might seem a little bit clumsy  but our solution would be  okay  hide your arms. And one time  she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face. All right  well  hide your face. And we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined  even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands  just hiding them in the pockets. When we started out on the milk project  and when I started out  I couldn't have foreseen that I would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tripping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk. But then again  I guess it's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar  as long as you're willing to look beyond what's already been brought to light  that you can see what's below the surface  hiding in the shadows  and recognize that there can be more there than meets the eye. Thank you. When I was a young man  I spent six years of wild adventure in the tropics working as an investigative journalist in some of the most bewitching parts of the world. I was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be. This is why wars get fought. But I also felt more alive than I've ever done since. And when I came home  I found the scope of my existence gradually diminishing until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge. And I found myself sort of scratching at the walls of life  as if I was trying to find a way out into a wider space beyond. I was  I believe  ecologically bored. Now  we evolved in rather more challenging times than these  in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws. And we still possess the fear and the courage and the aggression required to navigate those times. But in our comfortable  safe  crowded lands  we have few opportunities to exercise them without harming other people. And this was the sort of constraint that I found myself bumping up against. To conquer uncertainty  to know what comes next  that's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies  and having got there  or almost got there  we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs. We've privileged safety over experience and we've gained a lot in doing so  but I think we've lost something too. Now  I don't romanticize evolutionary time. I'm already beyond the lifespan of most hunter gatherers  and the outcome of a mortal combat between me myopically stumbling around with a stone tipped spear and an enraged giant aurochs isn't very hard to predict. Nor was it authenticity that I was looking for. I don't find that a useful or even intelligible concept. I just wanted a richer and rawer life than I've been able to lead in Britain  or  indeed  that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world. And it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word that I began to understand what I was looking for. And as soon as I found that word  I realized that I wanted to devote much of the rest of my life to it. The word is  rewilding   and even though rewilding is a young word  it already has several definitions. But there are two in particular that fascinate me. The first one is the mass restoration of ecosystems. One of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades. A trophic cascade is an ecological process which starts at the top of the food chain and tumbles all the way down to the bottom  and the classic example is what happened in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States when wolves were reintroduced in     . Now  we all know that wolves kill various species of animals  but perhaps we're slightly less aware that they give life to many others. It sounds strange  but just follow me for a while. Before the wolves turned up  they'd been absent for    years. The numbers of deer  because there was nothing to hunt them  had built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park  and despite efforts by humans to control them  they'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there to almost nothing  they'd just grazed it away. But as soon as the wolves arrived  even though they were few in number  they started to have the most remarkable effects. First  of course  they killed some of the deer  but that wasn't the major thing. Much more significantly  they radically changed the behavior of the deer. The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park  the places where they could be trapped most easily  particularly the valleys and the gorges  and immediately those places started to regenerate. In some areas  the height of the trees quintupled in just six years. Bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen and willow and cottonwood. And as soon as that happened  the birds started moving in. The number of songbirds  of migratory birds  started to increase greatly. The number of beavers started to increase  because beavers like to eat the trees. And beavers  like wolves  are ecosystem engineers. They create niches for other species. And the dams they built in the rivers provided habitats for otters and muskrats and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians. The wolves killed coyotes  and as a result of that  the number of rabbits and mice began to rise  which meant more hawks  more weasels  more foxes  more badgers. Ravens and bald eagles came down to feed on the carrion that the wolves had left. Bears fed on it too  and their population began to rise as well  partly also because there were more berries growing on the regenerating shrubs  and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves by killing some of the calves of the deer. But here's where it gets really interesting. The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers. They began to meander less. There was less erosion. The channels narrowed. More pools formed  more riffle sections  all of which were great for wildlife habitats. The rivers changed in response to the wolves  and the reason was that the regenerating forests stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often  so that the rivers became more fixed in their course. Similarly  by driving the deer out of some places and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides  there was less soil erosion  because the vegetation stabilized that as well. So the wolves  small in number  transformed not just the ecosystem of the Yellowstone National Park  this huge area of land  but also its physical geography. Whales in the southern oceans have similarly wide ranging effects. One of the many post rational excuses made by the Japanese government for killing whales is that they said   Well  the number of fish and krill will rise and then there'll be more for people to eat.  Well  it's a stupid excuse  but it sort of kind of makes sense  doesn't it  because you'd think that whales eat huge amounts of fish and krill  so obviously take the whales away  there'll be more fish and krill. But the opposite happened. You take the whales away  and the number of krill collapses. Why would that possibly have happened  Well  it now turns out that the whales are crucial to sustaining that entire ecosystem  and one of the reasons for this is that they often feed at depth and then they come up to the surface and produce what biologists politely call large fecal plumes  huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters  up in the photic zone  where there's enough light to allow photosynthesis to take place  and those great plumes of fertilizer stimulate the growth of phytoplankton  the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain  which stimulate the growth of zooplankton  which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it. The other thing that whales do is that  as they're plunging up and down through the water column  they're kicking the phytoplankton back up towards the surface where it can continue to survive and reproduce. And interestingly  well  we know that plant plankton in the oceans absorb carbon from the atmosphere    the more plant plankton there are  the more carbon they absorb    and eventually they filter down into the abyss and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system. Well  it seems that when whales were at their historic populations  they were probably responsible for sequestering some tens of millions of tons of carbon every year from the atmosphere. And when you look at it like that  you think  wait a minute  here are the wolves changing the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park. Here are the whales changing the composition of the atmosphere. You begin to see that possibly  the evidence supporting James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis  which conceives of the world as a coherent  self regulating organism  is beginning  at the ecosystem level  to accumulate. Trophic cascades tell us that the natural world is even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was. They tell us that when you take away the large animals  you are left with a radically different ecosystem to one which retains its large animals. And they make  in my view  a powerful case for the reintroduction of missing species. Rewilding  to me  means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals. It means taking down the fences  it means blocking the drainage ditches  it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea  but otherwise stepping back. It has no view as to what a right ecosystem or a right assemblage of species looks like. It doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef. It lets nature decide  and nature  by and large  is pretty good at deciding. Now  I mentioned that there are two definitions of rewilding that interest me. The other one is the rewilding of human life. And I don't see this as an alternative to civilization. I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology  as we're doing now  but at the same time  if we choose  have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure when we want to because there would be wonderful  rewilded habitats. And the opportunities for this are developing more rapidly than you might think possible. There's one estimate which suggests that in the United States  two thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared has become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated  particularly from the eastern half of the country. There's another one which suggests that    million hectares of land in Europe  an area the size of Poland  will be vacated by farmers between      and     . Now  faced with opportunities like that  does it not seem a little unambitious to be thinking only of bringing back wolves  lynx  bears  beavers  bison  boar  moose  and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across Europe  Perhaps we should also start thinking about the return of some of our lost megafauna. What megafauna  you say  Well  every continent had one  apart from Antarctica. When Trafalgar Square in London was excavated  the river gravels there were found to be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus  rhinos  elephants  hyenas  lions. Yes  ladies and gentlemen  there were lions in Trafalgar Square long before Nelson's Column was built. All these species lived here in the last interglacial period  when temperatures were pretty similar to our own. It's not climate  largely  which has got rid of the world's megafaunas. It's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so. And even so  you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems. Why is it that so many deciduous trees are able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken  Why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark  Why do understory trees  which are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind and have to carry less weight than the big canopy trees  why are they so much tougher and harder to break than the canopy trees are  Elephants. They are elephant adapted. In Europe  for example  they evolved to resist the straight tusked elephant  elephas antiquus  which was a great beast. It was related to the Asian elephant  but it was a temperate animal  a temperate forest creature. It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant. But why is it that some of our common shrubs have spines which seem to be over engineered to resist browsing by deer  Perhaps because they evolved to resist browsing by rhinoceros. Isn't it an amazing thought that every time you wander into a park or down an avenue or through a leafy street  you can see the shadows of these great beasts  Paleoecology  the study of past ecosystems  crucial to an understanding of our own  feels like a portal through which you may pass into an enchanted kingdom. And if we really are looking at areas of land of the sort of sizes I've been talking about becoming available  why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna  or at least species closely related to those which have become extinct everywhere  Why shouldn't all of us have a Serengeti on our doorsteps  And perhaps this is the most important thing that rewilding offers us  the most important thing that's missing from our lives  hope. In motivating people to love and defend the natural world  an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair. The story rewilding tells us is that ecological change need not always proceed in one direction. It offers us the hope that our silent spring could be replaced by a raucous summer. Thank you. This is Charley Williams. He was    when this photograph was taken. In the     s  Roosevelt put thousands and thousands of Americans back to work by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels  but he also did something interesting  which was to hire a few hundred writers to scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans. Charley Williams  a poor sharecropper  wouldn't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview  but Charley had actually been a slave until he was    years old. And the stories that were captured of his life make up one of the crown jewels of histories  of human lived experiences filled with ex slaves. Anna Deavere Smith famously said that there's a literature inside of each of us  and three generations later  I was part of a project called StoryCorps  which set out to capture the stories of ordinary Americans by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces. The idea is very  very simple. You go into these booths  you interview your grandmother or relative  you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the Library of Congress. It's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive one conversation at a time. And the question is  who do you want to remember    if you had just    minutes with your grandmother  What's interesting  in conversations with the founder  Dave Isay  we always actually talked about this as a little bit of a subversive project  because when you think about it  it's actually not really about the stories that are being told  it's about listening  and it's about the questions that you get to ask  questions that you may not have permission to on any other day. I'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project.  Jesus Melendez talking about poet Pedro Pietri's final moments  Jesus Melendez  We took off  and as we were ascending  before we had leveled off  our level off point was        feet  so before we had leveled off  Pedro began leaving us  and the beauty about it is that I believe that there's something after life. You can see it in Pedro.  Danny Perasa to his wife Annie Perasa married    years  Danny Perasa  See  the thing of it is  I always feel guilty when I say  I love you  to you  and I say it so often. I say it to remind you that as dumpy as I am  it's coming from me  it's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio  and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.  Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz  Michael Wolmetz  So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother  and we can leave it there. And he saved up and he purchased this  and he proposed to my mother with this  and so I thought that I would give it to you so that he could be with us for this also. So I'm going to share a mic with you right now  Debora. Where's the right finger  Debora Brakarz   Crying  MW  Debora  will you please marry me  DB  Yes. Of course. I love you. MW  So kids  this is how your mother and I got married  in a booth in Grand Central Station with my father's ring. My grandfather was a cab driver for    years. He used to pick people up here every day. So it seems right. Jake Barton  So I have to say I did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry. The entire project is predicated on this act of love which is listening itself. And that motion of building an institution out of a moment of conversation and listening is actually a lot of what my firm  Local Projects  is doing with our engagements in general. So we're a media design firm  and we're working with a broad array of different institutions building media installations for museums and public spaces. Our latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art  which we've created an engagement called Gallery One for. And Gallery One is an interesting project because it started with this massive       million expansion for the Cleveland Museum of Art  and we actually brought in this piece specifically to grow new capacity  new audiences  at the same time that the museum itself is growing. Glenn Lowry  the head of MoMA  put it best when he said   We want visitors to actually cease being visitors. Visitors are transient. We want people who live here  people who have ownership.  And so what we're doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries  so you can still have a traditional gallery experience  but if you're interested  you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it's from  or manipulate the work itself. So  for example  you can click on this individual lion head  and this is where it originated from       B.C. Or this individual piece here  you can see the actual bedroom. It really changes the way you think about this type of a tempera painting. This is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself. This is Rodin's bust. You get the sense of this incredible factory for creativity. And it makes you think about literally the hundreds or thousands of years of human creativity and how each individual artwork stands in for part of that story. This is Picasso  of course embodying so much of it from the   th century. And so our next interface  which I'll show you  actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity. It's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse the actual museum's collection using facial recognition. So this person's making different faces  and it's actually drawing forth different objects from the collection that connect with exactly how she's looking. And so you can imagine that  as people are performing inside of the museum itself  you get this sense of this emotional connection  this way in which our face connects with the thousands and tens of thousands of years. This is an interface that actually allows you to draw and then draws forth objects using those same shapes. So more and more we're trying to find ways for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves  to be creative even as they're looking at other people's creativity and understanding them. So in this wall  the collections wall  you can actually see all       artworks all at the same time  and you can actually author your own individual walking tours of the museum  so you can share them  and someone can take a tour with the museum director or a tour with their little cousin. But all the while that we've been working on this engagement for Cleveland  we've also been working in the background on really our largest engagement to date  and that's the      Memorial and Museum. So we started in      as part of a team with Thinc Design to create the original master plan for the museum  and then we've done all the media design both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production. So the memorial opened in       and the museum's going to open next year in     . And you can see from these images  the site is so raw and almost archaeological. And of course the event itself is so recent  somewhere between history and current events  it was a huge challenge to imagine how do you actually live up to a space like this  an event like this  to actually tell that story. And so what we started with was really a new way of thinking about building an institution  through a project called Make History  which we launched in     . So it's estimated that a third of the world watched      live  and a third of the world heard about it within    hours  making it really by nature of when it happened  this unprecedented moment of global awareness. And so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world  through video  through photos  through written history  and so people's experiences on that day  which was  in fact  this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this open platform. But that was coupled together with this oral histories booth  really the simplest we've ever made  where you locate yourself on a map. It's in six languages  and you can tell your own story about what happened to you on that day. And when we started seeing the incredible images and stories that came forth from all around the world    this is obviously part of the landing gear    we really started to understand that there was this amazing symmetry between the event itself  between the way that people were telling the stories of the event  and how we ourselves needed to tell that story. This image in particular really captured our attention at the time  because it so much sums up that event. This is a shot from the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. There's a firefighter that's stuck  actually  in traffic  and so the firefighters themselves are running a mile and a half to the site itself with upwards of    pounds of gear on their back. And we got this amazing email that said   While viewing the thousands of photos on the site  I unexpectedly found a photo of my son. It was a shock emotionally  yet a blessing to find this photo   and he was writing because he said   I'd like to personally thank the photographer for posting the photo  as it meant more than words can describe to me to have access to what is probably the last photo ever taken of my son.  And it really made us recognize what this institution needed to be in order to actually tell that story. We can't have just a historian or a curator narrating objectively in the third person about an event like that  when you have the witnesses to history who are going to make their way through the actual museum itself. And so we started imagining the museum  along with the creative team at the museum and the curators  thinking about how the first voice that you would hear inside the museum would actually be of other visitors. And so we created this idea of an opening gallery called We Remember. And I'll just play you part of a mockup of it  but you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter into that moment in time and be transported back in history. Voice    Sur les Champs  lys es    Paris. Voice    In college  at U.C. Berkeley. Voice    I was in Times Square. Voice    S o Paolo  Brazil. Voice    It was probably about    o'clock at night. Voice    I was driving to work at      local time in the morning. Voice    We were actually in a meeting when someone barged in and said   Oh my God  a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center.  Voice     Trying to frantically get to a radio. Voice     When I heard it over the radio    Voice     Heard it on the radio. Voice     I got a call from my father. Voice     The phone rang  it woke me up. My business partner told me to turn on the television. Voice     So I switched on the television. Voice     All channels in Italy were displaying the same thing. Voice     The Twin Towers. Voice     The Twin Towers. JB  And you move from there into that open  cavernous space. This is the so called slurry wall. It's the original  excavated wall at the base of the World Trade Center that withstood the actual pressure from the Hudson River for a full year after the event itself. And so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity  of presence of that moment into the actual exhibition itself. And we tell the stories of being inside the towers through that same audio collage  so you're hearing people literally talking about seeing the planes as they make their way into the building  or making their way down the stairwells. And as you make your way into the exhibition where it talks about the recovery  we actually project directly onto these moments of twisted steel all of the experiences from people who literally excavated on top of the pile itself. And so you can hear oral histories    so people who were actually working the so called bucket brigades as you're seeing literally the thousands of experiences from that moment. And as you leave that storytelling moment understanding about       we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening and actually talk to the individual visitors and ask them their own experiences about     . And we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable  the types of questions that      itself draws forth for all of us. And so these are questions like   How can a democracy balance freedom and security    How could      have happened    And how did the world change after        And so these oral histories  which we've actually been capturing already for years  are then mixed together with interviews that we're doing with people like Donald Rumsfeld  Bill Clinton  Rudy Giuliani  and you mix together these different players and these different experiences  these different reflection points about     . And suddenly the institution  once again  turns into a listening experience. So I'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices  but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event. Voice    It's something that we shared  and it's something that united us. Voice    And I knew when I saw that  people who were there that day who immediately went to help people known and unknown to them was something that would pull us through. Voice    All the outpouring of affection and emotion that came from our country was something really that will forever  ever stay with me. Voice    Still today I pray and think about those who lost their lives  and those who gave their lives to help others  but I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country  the love  the compassIon  the strength  and I watched a nation come together in the middle of a terrible tragedy. JB  And so as people make their way out of the museum  reflecting on the experience  reflecting on their own thoughts of it  they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself  because they've gone back up to grade  and we actually got involved in the memorial after we'd done the museum for a few years. The original designer of the memorial  Michael Arad  had this image in his mind of all the names appearing undifferentiated  almost random  really a poetic reflection on top of the nature of a terrorism event itself  but it was a huge challenge for the families  for the foundation  certainly for the first responders  and there was a negotiation that went forth and a solution was found to actually create not an order in terms of chronology  or in terms of alphabetical  but through what's called meaningful adjacency. So these are groupings of the names themselves which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order  and we  along with Jer Thorp  created an algorithm to take massive amounts of data to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves. So this is an image of the actual algorithm itself with the names scrambled for privacy  but you can see that these blocks of color are actually the four different flights  the two different towers  the first responders  and you can actually see within that different floors  and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections that were requested by the families themselves. And so when you go to the memorial  you can actually see the overarching organization inside of the individual pools themselves. You can see the way that the geography of the event is reflected inside of the memorial  and you can search for an individual name  or in this case an employer  Cantor Fitzgerald  and see the way in which all of those names  those hundreds of names  are actually organized onto the memorial itself  and use that to navigate the memorial. And more importantly  when you're actually at the site of the memorial  you can see those connections. You can see the relationships between the different names themselves. So suddenly what is this undifferentiated  anonymous group of names springs into reality as an individual life. In this case  Harry Ramos  who was the head trader at an investment bank  who stopped to aid Victor Wald on the   th floor of the South Tower. And Ramos told Wald  according to witnesses   I'm not going to leave you.  And Wald's widow requested that they be listed next to each other. Three generations ago  we had to actually get people to go out and capture the stories for common people. Today  of course  there's an unprecedented amount of stories for all of us that are being captured for future generations. And this is our hope  that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories. Thank you very much. When I was about three or four years old  I remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers  and I remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book  to feel the picture they were discussing. And my mum said   Darling  remember that you can't see and you can't feel the picture and you can't feel the print on the page.  And I thought to myself   But that's what I want to do. I love stories. I want to read.  Little did I know that I would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true. I was born premature by about    weeks  which resulted in my blindness  some    years ago. The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia  and it's now very rare in the developed world. Little did I know  lying curled up in my prim baby humidicrib in      that I'd been born at the right place and the right time  that I was in a country where I could participate in the technological revolution. There are    million totally blind people on our planet  but those of us who've shared in the technological changes mainly come from North America  Europe  Japan and other developed parts of the world. Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world  but I think they've changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group. And so I want to tell you about the interaction between computer based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years to become the person I am today. It's an interaction between volunteers  passionate inventors and technology  and it's a story that many other blind people could tell. But let me tell you a bit about it today. When I was five  I went to school and I learned braille. It's an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper  and I can feel them with my fingers. In fact  I think they're putting up my grade six report. I don't know where Julian Morrow got that from. I was pretty good in reading  but religion and musical appreciation needed more work. When you leave the opera house  you'll find there's braille signage in the lifts. Look for it. Have you noticed it  I do. I look for it all the time. When I was at school  the books were transcribed by transcribers  voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so I'd have volumes to read  and that had been going on  mainly by women  since the late   th century in this country  but it was the only way I could read. When I was in high school  I got my first Philips reel to reel tape recorder  and tape recorders became my sort of pre computer medium of learning. I could have family and friends read me material  and I could then read it back as many times as I needed. And it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers. For example  when I studied at graduate school at Queen's University in Canada  the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me. I gave them a tape recorder  and they read into it. As one of them said to me   Ron  we ain't going anywhere at the moment.  But think of it. These men  who hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had  helped me gain post graduate qualifications in law by their dedicated help. Well  I went back and became an academic at Melbourne's Monash University  and for those    years  tape recorders were everything to me. In fact  in my office in       I had    miles of tape. Students  family and friends all read me material. Mrs. Lois Doery  whom I later came to call my surrogate mum  read me many thousands of hours onto tape. One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lois would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her. But sadly  her health hasn't permitted her to come today. But I thank you here  Lois  from this platform. I saw my first Apple computer in       and I thought to myself   This thing's got a glass screen  not much use to me.  How very wrong I was. In       in the month our eldest son Gerard was born  I got my first blind computer  and it's actually here. See it up there  And you see it has no  what do you call it  no screen. It's a blind computer. It's a Keynote Gold   k  and the   k stands for it had    kilobytes of memory. Don't laugh  it cost me       dollars at the time.  Laughter  I think there's more memory in my watch. It was invented by Russell Smith  a passionate inventor in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people. Sadly  he died in a light plane crash in       but his memory lives on in my heart. It meant  for the first time  I could read back what I had typed into it. It had a speech synthesizer. I'd written my first coauthored labor law book on a typewriter in      purely from memory. This now allowed me to read back what I'd written and to enter the computer world  even with its   k of memory. In       the great Ray Kurzweil  the American inventor  worked on building a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech. Optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font  but by using charge coupled device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers  he developed a machine that could read any font. And his machine  which was as big as a washing machine  was launched on the   th of January      . I saw my first commercially available Kurzweil in March       and it blew me away  and in September       the month that my associate professorship at Monash University was announced  the law school got one  and I could use it. For the first time  I could read what I wanted to read by putting a book on the scanner. I didn't have to be nice to people  I no longer would be censored. For example  I was too shy then  and I'm actually too shy now  to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material. But  you know  I could pop a book on in the middle of the night  and    Now  the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop. That's what it's shrunk to. And now I can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries. I can keep up with my friends. There are many people who have helped me in my life  and many that I haven't met. One is another American inventor Ted Henter. Ted was a motorcycle racer  but in      he had a car accident and lost his sight  which is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes. He then turned to being a waterskier and was a champion disabled waterskier. But in       he teamed up with Bill Joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the Net or from what was on the computer. It's called JAWS  Job Access With Speech  and it sounds like this. Ron McCallum  Isn't that slow  You see  if I read like that  I'd fall asleep. I slowed it down for you. I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it. Can we play that one  RM  You know  when you're marking student essays  you want to get through them fairly quickly. This technology that fascinated me in      is now on my iPhone and on yours as well. But  you know  I find reading with machines a very lonely process. I grew up with family  friends  reading to me  and I loved the warmth and the breath and the closeness of people reading. Do you love being read to  And one of my most enduring memories is in       Mary reading to me and the children down near Manly Beach  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.  Isn't that a great book  I still love being close to someone reading to me. But I wouldn't give up the technology  because it's allowed me to lead a great life. Of course  talking books for the blind predated all this technology. After all  the long playing record was developed in the early     s  and now we put talking books on CDs using the digital access system known as DAISY. But when I'm reading with synthetic voices  I love to come home and read a racy novel with a real voice. Now there are still barriers in front of we people with disabilities. Many websites we can't read using JAWS and the other technologies. Websites are often very visual  and there are all these sorts of graphs that aren't labeled and buttons that aren't labeled  and that's why the World Wide Web Consortium    known as W C  has developed worldwide standards for the Internet. And we want all Internet users or Internet site owners to make their sites compatible so that we persons without vision can have a level playing field. There are other barriers brought about by our laws. For example  Australia  like about one third of the world's countries  has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled or read for we blind persons. But those books can't travel across borders. For example  in Spain  there are a         accessible books in Spanish. In Argentina  there are       . In no other Latin American country are there more than a couple of thousand. But it's not legal to transport the books from Spain to Latin America. There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the United States  Britain  Canada  Australia  etc.  but they can't be transported to the    countries in our world where English is the first and the second language. And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter. Well  because we can't transport books across borders  there had to be separate versions read in all the different English speaking countries  Britain  United States  Canada  Australia  and New Zealand all had to have separate readings of Harry Potter. And that's why  next month in Morocco  a meeting is taking place between all the countries. It's something that a group of countries and the World Blind Union are advocating  a cross border treaty so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception  we can transport those books across borders and give life to people  particularly in developing countries  blind people who don't have the books to read. I want that to happen. My life has been extraordinarily blessed with marriage and children and certainly interesting work to do  whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School  where I served a term as dean  or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  in Geneva. I've indeed been a very fortunate human being. I wonder what the future will hold. The technology will advance even further  but I can still remember my mum saying     years ago   Remember  darling  you'll never be able to read the print with your fingers.  I'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers  volunteer readers and passionate inventors  has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me and for blind people throughout the world. I'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin  who is my slide clicker  who clicks the slides  and my wife  Professor Mary Crock  who's the light of my life  is coming on to collect me. I want to thank her too. I think I have to say goodbye now. Bless you. Thank you very much. Yay   Applause  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Applause  So over the long course of human history  the infectious disease that's killed more humans than any other is malaria. It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos  and it's probably our oldest scourge. We may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes. And to this day  malaria takes a huge toll on our species. We've got     million cases a year and over half a million deaths. Now this really makes no sense. We've known how to cure malaria since the     s. That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru discovered the bark of the cinchona tree  and inside that bark was quinine  still an effective cure for malaria to this day. So we've known how to cure malaria for centuries. We've known how to prevent malaria since     . That's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria  not bad air or miasmas  as was previously thought. So malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve  and yet to this day  hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from the bite of a mosquito. Why is that  This is a question that's personally intrigued me for a long time. I grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants visiting my cousins in India every summer  and because I had no immunity to the local malarias  I was made to sleep under this hot  sweaty mosquito net every night while my cousins  they were allowed to sleep out on the terrace and have this nice  cool night breeze wafting over them. And I really hated the mosquitos for that. But at the same time  I come from a Jain family  and Jainism is a religion that espouses a very extreme form of nonviolence. So Jains are not supposed to eat meat. We're not supposed to walk on grass  because you could  you know  inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass. We're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos. So the fearsome power of this little insect was apparent to me from a very young age  and it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist trying to understand  why has malaria been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long  And I think there's three main reasons why. Those three reasons add up to the fourth reason  which is probably the biggest reason of all. The first reason is certainly scientific. This little parasite that causes malaria  it's probably one of the most complex and wily pathogens known to humankind. It lives half its life inside the cold blooded mosquito and half its life inside the warm blooded human. These two environments are totally different  but not only that  they're both utterly hostile. So the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite  and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off. This little creature survives under siege like that  but not only does it survive  it has thrived. It has spread. It has more ways to evade attack than we know. It's a shape shifter  for one thing. Just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly  the malaria parasite transforms itself like that seven times in its life cycle. And each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other  they have totally different physiology. So say you came up with some great drug that worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle. It might do nothing at all to any of the other stages. It can hide in our bodies  undetected  unbeknownst to us  for days  for weeks  for months  for years  in some cases even decades. So the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle  but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite. Only about    species of mosquitos carry most of the world's malaria  and we know quite a bit about the kinds of watery habitats that they specialize in. So you might think  then  well  why don't we just avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live  Right  We could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live. But say you live in the tropics and you walk outside your hut one day and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt around your home. Or say your cow does  or say your pig does  and then  say  it rains  and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water. That's it. You've created the perfect malarial mosquito habitat that's right outside your door. So it's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects. We kind of create places that they love to live just by living our own lives. So there's a huge scientific challenge  but there's a huge economic challenge too. Malaria occurs in some of the poorest and most remote places on Earth  and there's a reason for that. If you're poor  you're more likely to get malaria. If you're poor  you're more likely to live in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained. These are places where mosquitos breed. You're less likely to have door screens or window screens. You're less likely to have electricity and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible  so you're outside more. You're getting bitten by mosquitos more. So poverty causes malaria  but what we also know now is that malaria itself causes poverty. For one thing  it strikes hardest during harvest season  so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields collecting their crops  they're home sick with a fever. But it also predisposes people to death from all other causes. So this has happened historically. We've been able to take malaria out of a society. Everything else stays the same  so we still have bad food  bad water  bad sanitation  all the things that make people sick. But just if you take malaria out  deaths from everything else go down. And the economist Jeff Sachs has actually quantified what this means for a society. What it means is  if you have malaria in your society  your economic growth is depressed by  .  percent every year  year after year after year  just this one disease alone. So this poses a huge economic challenge  because say you do come up with your great drug or your great vaccine    how do you deliver it in a place where there's no roads  there's no infrastructure  there's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold  there's no clinics  there's no clinicians to deliver these things where they're needed  So there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria. But along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge  there's also a cultural challenge  and this is probably the part about malaria that people don't like to talk about. And it's the paradox that the people who have the most malaria in the world tend to care about it the least. This has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again. They ask people in malarious parts of the world   What do you think about malaria   And they don't say   It's a killer disease. We're scared of it.  They say   Malaria is a normal problem of life.  And that was certainly my personal experience. When I told my relatives in India that I was writing a book about malaria  they kind of looked at me like I told them I was writing a book about warts or something. Like  why would you write about something so boring  so ordinary  You know  And it's simple risk perception  really. A child in Malawi  for example  she might have    episodes of malaria before the age of two  but if she survives  she'll continue to get malaria throughout her life  but she's much less likely to die of it. And so in her lived experience  malaria is something that comes and goes. And that's actually true for most of the world's malaria. Most of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own. It's just  there's so much malaria that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death add up to this big  huge number. So I think people in malarious parts of the world must think of malaria the way those of us who live in the temperate world think of cold and flu. Right  Cold and flu have a huge burden on our societies and on our own lives  but we don't really even take the most rudimentary precautions against it because we consider it normal to get cold and flu during cold and flu season. And so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria  because if people think it's normal to have malaria  then how do you get them to run to the doctor to get diagnosed  to pick up their prescription  to get it filled  to take the drugs  to put on the repellents  to tuck in the bed nets  This is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease. So take all that together. We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated  it's economically challenging to deal with  and it's one for which the people who stand to benefit the most care about it the least. And that adds up to the biggest problem of all  which  of course  is the political problem. How do you get a political leader to do anything about a problem like this  And the answer is  historically  you don't. Most malarious societies throughout history have simply lived with the disease. So the main attacks on malaria have come from outside of malarious societies  from people who aren't constrained by these rather paralyzing politics. But this  I think  introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties. The first concerted attack against malaria started in the     s. It was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department. And this effort well understood the economic challenge. They knew they had to focus on cheap  easy to use tools  and they focused on DDT. They understood the cultural challenge. In fact  their rather patronizing view was that people at risk of malaria shouldn't be asked to do anything at all. Everything should be done to them and for them. But they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge. They had so much faith in their tools that they stopped doing malaria research. And so when those tools started to fail  and public opinion started to turn against those tools  they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do. The whole campaign crashed  malaria resurged back  but now it was even worse than before because it was corralled into the hardest to reach places in the most difficult to control forms. One WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign  one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health.  The latest effort to tame malaria started in the late     s. It's similarly directed and financed primarily from outside of malarious societies. Now this effort well understands the scientific challenge. They are doing tons of malaria research. And they understand the economic challenge too. They're focusing on very cheap  very easy to use tools. But now  I think  the dilemma is the cultural challenge. The centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net. It's treated with insecticides. This thing has been distributed across the malarious world by the millions. And when you think about the bed net  it's sort of a surgical intervention. You know  it doesn't really have any value to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria. And yet we're asking people to use these nets every night. They have to sleep under them every night. That's the only way they are effective. And they have to do that even if the net blocks the breeze  even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night and relieve themselves  even if they might have to move all their furnishings to put this thing up  even if  you know  they might live in a round hut in which it's difficult to string up a square net. Now that's no big deal if you're fighting a killer disease. I mean  these are minor inconveniences. But that's not how people with malaria think of malaria. So for them  the calculus must be quite different. Imagine  for example  if a bunch of well meaning Kenyans came up to those of us in the temperate world and said   You know  you people have a lot of cold and flu. We've designed this great  easy to use  cheap tool  we're going to give it to you for free. It's called a face mask  and all you need to do is wear it every day during cold and flu season when you go to school and when you go to work.  Would we do that  And I wonder if that's how people in the malarious world thought of those nets when they first received them  Indeed  we know from studies that only    percent of the bed nets that were first distributed were actually used. And even that's probably an overestimate  because the same people who distributed the nets went back and asked the recipients   Oh  did you use that net I gave you   Which is like your Aunt Jane asking you   Oh  did you use that vase I gave you for Christmas   So it's probably an overestimate. But that's not an insurmountable problem. We can do more education  we can try to convince these people to use the nets. And that's what happening now. We're throwing a lot more time and money into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays and school meetings  all these things to convince people to use the nets we gave you. And that might work. But it takes time. It takes money. It takes resources. It takes infrastructure. It takes all the things that that cheap  easy to use bed net was not supposed to be. So it's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies  but it's equally tricky when we try to attack it from outside of those societies. We end up imposing our own priorities on the people of the malarious world. That's exactly what we did in the     s  and that effort backfired. I would argue today  when we are distributing tools that we've designed and that don't necessarily make sense in people's lives  we run the risk of making the same mistake again. That's not to say that malaria is unconquerable  because I think it is  but what if we attacked this disease according to the priorities of the people who lived with it  Take the example of England and the United States. We had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years  and we got rid of it completely  not because we attacked malaria. We didn't. We attacked bad roads and bad houses and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty. We attacked the malarious way of life  and by doing that  we slowly built malaria out. Now attacking the malarious way of life  this is something    these are things people care about today. And attacking the malarious way of life  it's not fast  it's not cheap  it's not easy  but I think it's the only lasting way forward. Thank you so much. Do you think it's possible to control someone's attention  Even more than that  what about predicting human behavior  I think those are interesting ideas. For me  that would be the perfect superpower  actually kind of an evil way of approaching it. But for myself  in the past  I've spent the last    years studying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way  picking pockets. When we think of misdirection  we think of something as looking off to the side  when actually the things right in front of us are often the hardest to see  the things that you look at every day that you're blinded to. For example  how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now  Great. Double check. Make sure you still have them. I was doing some shopping before. You've looked at them a few times today  but I'll ask you a question. Without looking at it directly yet  can you remember the icon in the bottom right corner  Bring them out  check and see how accurate you were. How'd you do  Show of hands. Did we get it  Now that you're done  close them down. Every phone has something in common. No matter how you organize the icons  you still have a clock on the front. So  without looking at your phone  what time was it  You just looked at your clock  right  Interesting idea. Let's take that a step further with a game of trust. Close your eyes. I realize I'm asking you to do that while you just heard there's a pickpocket in the room  but close your eyes. Now  you've been watching me for about    seconds. With your eyes closed  what am I wearing  Make your best guess. What color is my shirt  What color is my tie  Now open your eyes. Show of hands  were you right  Interesting  isn't it  Some of us are a little bit more perceptive than others  it seems. But I have a different theory about that model of attention. They have fancy models of attention  Posner's trinity model of attention. For me  I like to think of it very simple  like a surveillance system. It's kind of like you have all these fancy sensors  and inside your brain is a little security guard. For me  I like to call him Frank. So Frank is sitting at a desk. He's got lots of cool information in front of him  high tech equipment  he's got cameras  he's got a little phone that he can pick up  listen to the ears  all these senses  all these perceptions. But attention is what steers your perceptions  it's what controls your reality. It's the gateway to the mind. If you don't attend to something  you can't be aware of it. But ironically  you can attend to something without being aware of it. For example  the cocktail effect  You're in a party  having conversations with someone  and yet you can recognize your name without realizing you were listening to that. Now  for my job  I have to play with techniques to exploit this  to play with your attention as a limited resource. So if I could control how you spend your attention  if I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction. Now  instead of doing it like misdirection and throwing it off to the side  instead  what I choose to focus on is Frank  to be able to play with the Frank inside your head  your security guard  and get you  instead of focusing on your external senses  just to go internal for a second. So if I ask you to access a memory  like  what is that  What just happened  Do you have a wallet  Do you have an American Express in your wallet  And when I do that  your Frank turns around. He accesses the file. He has to rewind the tape. What's interesting is  he can't rewind the tape at the same time that he's trying to process new data. This sounds like a good theory  but I could talk for a long time  tell you lots of things  and a portion of them may be true  but I think it's better if I tried to show that to you here live. If I come down  I'm going to do a bit of shopping. Just hold still where you are. Hello  how are you  It's lovely to see you. Wonderful job onstage. Lovely watch  it doesn't come off very well. Do you have a ring as well  Good. Just taking inventory. You're like a buffet. Hard to tell where to start  so many great things. Hi  how are you  Good to see you. Hi  sir  could you stand up  please  Just right where you are. You're married  you follow directions well. Nice to meet you  sir. You don't have a lot in your pockets. Anything down here  Hopefully so. Have a seat. There you go. You're doing well. Hi  sir  how are you  Good to see you  sir. You have a ring  a watch. Do you have a wallet on you  Joe  I don't. AR  Well  we'll find one for you. Come on up this way  Joe. Give Joe a round of applause. Come on up  Joe. Let's play a game. AR  Pardon me. I don't think I need this clicker anymore. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Come on up to the stage  Joe. Let's play a little game now. Anything in your front pockets  J  Money. AR  Money  All right  let's try that. Can you stand right over this way for me  Turn around and  let's see  if I give you something that belongs to me  this is just something I have  a poker chip. Hold out your hand for me. Watch it closely. This is a task for you to focus on. You have your money in your front pocket  J  Yup. AR  Good. I won't put my hand in your pocket. I'm not ready for that kind of commitment. Once a guy had a hole in his pocket  and that was rather traumatizing for me. I wanted his wallet  he gave me his number. Big miscommunication. Let's do this simply. Squeeze your hand tight. Do you feel the poker chip in your hand  J  I do. AR  Would you be surprised if I took it  Say yes. J  Very. AR  Good. Open your hand. Thank you very much. I'll cheat if you give me a chance. Make it harder for me. Just use your hand. Grab my wrist  but squeeze  squeeze firm. Did you see it go  Joe  No. AR  No  it's not here. Open your hand. While we're focused on the hand  it's sitting on your shoulder. Go ahead and take it off. Now  let's try that again. Hold your hand out flat. Open it up. Put your hand up a little bit higher  but watch it close. If I did it slowly  it'd be on your shoulder. Joe  we're going to keep doing this till you catch it. You'll get it eventually. I have faith in you. Squeeze firm. You're human  you're not slow. It's back on your shoulder. You were focused on your hand  distracted. While you were watching  I couldn't get your watch off. Yet you had something inside your pocket. Do you remember what it was  J  Money. AR  Check your pocket. Is it still there  Oh  there it was. Put it away. We're just shopping. This trick's more about the timing. I'm going to try to push it inside your hand. Put your other hand on top  would you  It's amazingly obvious now  isn't it  Looks a lot like the watch I was wearing  doesn't it  J  That's pretty good. AR  Oh  thanks. But it's only a start. Let's try it a little bit differently. Hold your hands together. Your other hand on top. If you're watching this little token  this obviously has become a little target  like a red herring. If we watch this kind of close  it looks like it goes away. It's not back on your shoulder. It falls out of the air  lands right back in the hand. Did you see it go  Yeah  funny. We've got a little guy. He's union  works up there all day. If I do it slowly it goes straight away  it lands by your pocket. Is it in this pocket  sir  Don't reach in your pocket. That's a different show. That's rather strange. They have shots for that. Can I show them  Rather bizarre. Is this yours  sir  I have no idea how that works. We'll send that over there. I need help with this one. Step over this way for me. Don't run away. You had something down by your pants pocket. I was checking mine. I couldn't find everything  but I noticed you had something here. Can I feel the outside for a moment  Down here I noticed this. Is this something of yours  sir  I have no idea. That's a shrimp. J  Yeah. I'm saving it for later. AR  You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way  better than you know. So we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift. Hopefully it matches his taste. We have a couple of other things  a little bit of cash. And we have a few other things  these all belong to you  along with a big round of applause from all your friends. Joe  thank you very much. So  same question I asked you before  but this time you don't have to close your eyes. What am I wearing  Audience  Oh  Attention is a powerful thing. Like I said  it shapes your reality. So  I guess I'd like to pose that question to you. If you could control somebody's attention  what would you do with it  Thank you. I'm going to be showing some of the cybercriminals' latest and nastiest creations. So basically  please don't go and download any of the viruses that I show you. Some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like  and I thought I'd give you a quick insight into my career so far. It's a pretty accurate description. This is what someone that specializes in malware and hacking looks like. So today  computer viruses and trojans  designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your webcam to the theft of billions of dollars. Some malicious code today goes as far as targeting power  utilities and infrastructure. Let me give you a quick snapshot of what malicious code is capable of today. Right now  every second  eight new users are joining the Internet. Today  we will see         individual new computer viruses. We will see        new infected websites. And  just to kind of tear down a myth here  lots of people think that when you get infected with a computer virus  it's because you went to a porn site. Right  Well  actually  statistically speaking  if you only visit porn sites  you're safer. People normally write that down  by the way.  Laughter  Actually  about    percent of these are small business websites getting infected. Today's cybercriminal  what do they look like  Well  many of you have the image  don't you  of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement  hacking away for notoriety. But actually today  cybercriminals are wonderfully professional and organized. In fact  they have product adverts. You can go online and buy a hacking service to knock your business competitor offline. Check out this one I found. and that reason is because you need your business competitors  rivals  haters  or whatever the reason is  or who  they are to go down. Well you  my friend  you've came to the right place. If you want your business competitors to go down  well  they can. If you want your rivals to go offline  well  they will. Not only that  we are providing a short term to long term DDOS service or scheduled attack  starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites to    to    dollars per hour. James Lyne  Now  I did actually pay one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website. Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company. Turns out that's not cool. But regardless  it's amazing how many products and services are available now to cybercriminals. For example  this testing platform  which enables the cybercriminals to test the quality of their viruses before they release them on the world. For a small fee  they can upload it and make sure everything is good. But it goes further. Cybercriminals now have crime packs with business intelligence reporting dashboards to manage the distribution of their malicious code. This is the market leader in malware distribution  the Black Hole Exploit Pack  responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution in the last couple of quarters. It comes with technical installation guides  video setup routines  and get this  technical support. You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you how to set up your illegal hacking server. So let me show you what malicious code looks like today. What I've got here is two systems  an attacker  which I've made look all Matrix y and scary  and a victim  which you might recognize from home or work. Now normally  these would be on different sides of the planet or of the Internet  but I've put them side by side because it makes things much more interesting. Now  there are many ways you can get infected. You will have come in contact with some of them. Maybe some of you have received an email that says something like   Hi  I'm a Nigerian banker  and I'd like to give you    billion dollars because I like your face.  Or funnycats.exe  which rumor has it was quite successful in China's recent campaign against America. Now there are many ways you can get infected. I want to show you a couple of my favorites. This is a little USB key. Now how do you get a USB key to run in a business  Well  you could try looking really cute. Awww. Or  in my case  awkward and pathetic. So imagine this scenario  I walk into one of your businesses  looking very awkward and pathetic  with a copy of my C.V. which I've covered in coffee  and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key and print me a new one. So let's have a look here on my victim computer. What I'm going to do is plug in the USB key. After a couple of seconds  things start to happen on the computer on their own  usually a bad sign. This would  of course  normally happen in a couple of seconds  really  really quickly  but I've kind of slowed it down so you can actually see the attack occurring. Malware is very boring otherwise. So this is writing out the malicious code  and a few seconds later  on the left hand side  you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text. Now if I place the mouse cursor over it  this is what we call a command prompt  and using this we can navigate around the computer. We can access your documents  your data. You can turn on the webcam. That can be very embarrassing. Or just to really prove a point  we can launch programs like my personal favorite  the Windows Calculator. So isn't it amazing how much control the attackers can get with such a simple operation  Let me show you how most malware is now distributed today. What I'm going to do is open up a website that I wrote. It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics. And it's got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website. Many of you will have used something a bit like this before. Unfortunately  when this was implemented  the developer was slightly inebriated and managed to forget all of the secure coding practices he had learned. So let's imagine that our attacker  called Evil Hacker just for comedy value  inserts something a little nasty. This is a script. It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage. So I'm going to submit this post  and then  on my victim computer  I'm going to open up the web browser and browse to my website  www.incrediblyhacked.com. Notice that after a couple of seconds  I get redirected. That website address at the top there  which you can just about see  microshaft.com  the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs  and up pops fake antivirus. This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software  and it will go through and it will scan the system  have a look at what its popping up here. It creates some very serious alerts. Oh look  a child porn proxy server. We really should clean that up. What's really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data  but when the scan finishes  they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses  you have to register the product. Now I liked it better when viruses were free. People now pay cybercriminals money to run viruses  which I find utterly bizarre. So anyway  let me change pace a little bit. Chasing         pieces of malware a day is a massive challenge  and those numbers are only growing directly in proportion to the length of my stress line  you'll note here. So I want to talk to you briefly about a group of hackers we tracked for a year and actually found    and this is a rare treat in our job. Now this was a cross industry collaboration  people from Facebook  independent researchers  guys from Sophos. So here we have a couple of documents which our cybercriminals had uploaded to a cloud service  kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive  like many of you might use. At the top  you'll notice a section of source code. What this would do is send the cybercriminals a text message every day telling them how much money they'd made that day  so a kind of cybercriminal billings report  if you will. If you look closely  you'll notice a series of what are Russian telephone numbers. Now that's obviously interesting  because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals. Down below  highlighted in red  in the other section of source code  is this bit  leded leded.  That's a username  kind of like you might have on Twitter. So let's take this a little further. There are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded. Lots of you here will use smartphones to take photos and post them from the conference. An interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones is that when you take a photo  it embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken. In fact  I've been spending a lot of time on Internet dating sites recently  obviously for research purposes  and I've noticed that about    percent of the profile pictures on Internet dating sites contain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken  which is kind of scary because you wouldn't give out your home address to lots of strangers  but we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates to plus or minus    meters. And our cybercriminals had done the same thing. So here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg. We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool. We used Google. Using the email address  the telephone number and the GPS data  on the left you see an advert for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling  on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens. One of these was more stereotypical for me. A little more searching  and here's our cybercriminal. Imagine  these are hardened cybercriminals sharing information scarcely. Imagine what you could find about each of the people in this room. A bit more searching through the profile and there's a photo of their office. They were working on the third floor. And you can also see some photos from his business companion where he has a taste in a certain kind of image. It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation. But this is where our investigation starts to slow down. The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well. And herein is the greatest lesson of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now. Our friends  our families and our colleagues can break our security even when we do the right things. This is MobSoft  one of the companies that this cybercriminal gang owned  and an interesting thing about MobSoft is the    percent owner of this posted a job advert  and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers from the code earlier. This woman was Maria  and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals. And it's kind of like she went into her social media settings and clicked on every option imaginable to make herself really  really insecure. By the end of the investigation  where you can read the full    page report at that link  we had photos of the cybercriminals  even the office Christmas party when they were out on an outing. That's right  cybercriminals do have Christmas parties  as it turns out. Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys. Let me come back to that in just a minute. I want to change pace to one last little demonstration  a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic  but is interesting in exposing how much information we're all giving away  and it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience. This is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately. Many of you all know about the concept of scanning for wireless networks. You do it every time you take out your iPhone or your Blackberry and connect to something like TEDAttendees. But what you might not know is that you're also beaming out a list of networks you've previously connected to  even when you're not using wireless actively. So I ran a little scan. I was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals  who wouldn't be so concerned by law  and here you can see my mobile device. Okay  So you can see a list of wireless networks. TEDAttendees  HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying  My home network  PrettyFlyForAWifi  which I think is a great name. Sophos Visitors  SANSEMEA  companies I work with. Loganwifi  that's in Boston. HiltonLondon. CIASurveillanceVan. We called it that at one of our conferences because we thought that would freak people out  which is quite fun. This is how geeks party. So let's make this a little bit more interesting. Let's talk about you. Twenty three percent of you have been to Starbucks recently and used the wireless network. Things get more interesting. Forty six percent of you I could link to a business  XYZ Employee network. This isn't an exact science  but it gets pretty accurate. Seven hundred and sixty one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently  absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe. Two hundred and thirty four of you  well  I know where you live. Your wireless network name is so unique that I was able to pinpoint it using data available openly on the Internet with no hacking or clever  clever tricks. And I should mention as well that some of you do use your names   James Lyne's iPhone   for example. And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity. So something for you to think about  As we adopt these new applications and mobile devices  as we play with these shiny new toys  how much are we trading off convenience for privacy and security  Next time you install something  look at the settings and ask yourself   Is this information that I want to share  Would someone be able to abuse it   We also need to think very carefully about how we develop our future talent pool. You see  technology's changing at a staggering rate  and that         pieces of malware won't stay the same for long. There's a very concerning trend that whilst many people coming out of schools now are much more technology savvy  they know how to use technology  fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects to know how that technology works under the covers. In the U.K.  a    percent reduction since       and there are similar statistics all over the world. We also need to think about the legal issues in this area. The cybercriminals I talked about  despite theft of millions of dollars  actually still haven't been arrested  and at this point possibly never will. Most laws are national in their implementation  despite cybercrime conventions  where the Internet is borderless and international by definition. Countries do not agree  which makes this area exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective. But my biggest ask is this  You see  you're going to leave here and you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news. You're going to read about malware doing incredible and terrifying  scary things. However     percent of it works because people fail to do the basics. So my ask is this  Go online  find these simple best practices  find out how to update and patch your computer. Get a secure password. Make sure you use a different password on each of your sites and services online. Find these resources. Apply them. The Internet is a fantastic resource for business  for political expression  for art and for learning. Help me and the security community make life much  much more difficult for cybercriminals. Thank you. This is our life with bees  and this is our life without bees. Bees are the most important pollinators of our fruits and vegetables and flowers and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals. More than one third of the world's crop production is dependent on bee pollination. But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there pollinating our food intentionally. They're out there because they need to eat. Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar. They're flower feeders  and as they move from flower to flower  basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart  they end up providing this valuable pollination service. In parts of the world where there are no bees  or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees  people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand. These people are moving pollen from flower to flower with a paintbrush. Now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon. Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand held vibrator. Now this one's the tomato tickler.  Laughter  Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower  the anther  and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it. So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it  and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note C. So they vibrate the flower  they sonicate it  and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh  and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body  and she takes it home as food. Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pollination when it's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes. So there's other  maybe more personal reasons  to care about bees. There's over        species of bees in the world  and they're absolutely gorgeous. These bees spend the majority of their life cycle hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem and very few of these beautiful species have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees. Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative for the other        plus species because there's something about honeybees that draws people into their world. Humans have been drawn to honeybees since early recorded history  mostly to harvest their honey  which is an amazing natural sweetener. I got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke. I was    years old and bored  and I picked up a book in the library on bees and I spent the night reading it. I had never thought about insects living in complex societies. It was like the best of science fiction come true. And even stranger  there were these people  these beekeepers  that loved their bees like they were family  and when I put down the book  I knew I had to see this for myself. So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper  a family that owned       hives of bees in New Mexico. And I was permanently hooked. Honeybees can be considered a super organism  where the colony is the organism and it's comprised of        to        individual bee organisms. Now this society has no central authority. Nobody's in charge. So how they come to collective decisions  and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor  how they communicate where the flowers are  all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing. My personal favorite  and one that I've studied for many years  is their system of healthcare. So bees have social healthcare. So in my lab  we study how bees keep themselves healthy. For example  we study hygiene  where some bees are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest  from the colony  and it keeps the colony healthy. And more recently  we've been studying resins that bees collect from plants. So bees fly to some plants and they scrape these very  very sticky resins off the leaves  and they take them back to the nest where they cement them into the nest architecture where we call it propolis. We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant. It's a natural antibiotic. It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony  and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity. Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times. We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies for human medicine  but we didn't know how good it was for the bees. So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over    million years. So seven years ago  when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse  first in the United States  it was clear that there was something really  really wrong. In our collective conscience  in a really primal way  we know we can't afford to lose bees. So what's going on  Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes  and I'll go through each of these. The bottom line is  bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape and a dysfunctional food system. Now we have the best data on honeybees  so I'll use them as an example. In the United States  bees in fact have been in decline since World War II. We have half the number of managed hives in the United States now compared to     . We're down to about two million hives of bees  we think. And the reason is  after World War II  we changed our farming practices. We stopped planting cover crops. We stopped planting clover and alfalfa  which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil  and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers. Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees. And after World War II  we started using herbicides to kill off the weeds in our farms. Many of these weeds are flowering plants that bees require for their survival. And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures. Now we talk about food deserts  places in our cities  neighborhoods that have no grocery stores. The very farms that used to sustain bees are now agricultural food deserts  dominated by one or two plant species like corn and soybeans. Since World War II  we have been systematically eliminating many of the flowering plants that bees need for their survival. And these monocultures extend even to crops that are good for bees  like almonds. Fifty years ago  beekeepers would take a few colonies  hives of bees into the almond orchards  for pollination  and also because the pollen in an almond blossom is really high in protein. It's really good for bees. Now  the scale of almond monoculture demands that most of our nation's bees  over  .  million hives of bees  be transported across the nation to pollinate this one crop. And they're trucked in in semi loads  and they must be trucked out  because after bloom  the almond orchards are a vast and flowerless landscape. Bees have been dying over the last    years  and we're planting more crops that need them. There has been a     percent increase in crop production that requires bee pollination. And then there's pesticides. After World War II  we started using pesticides on a large scale  and this became necessary because of the monocultures that put out a feast for crop pests. Recently  researchers from Penn State University have started looking at the pesticide residue in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food  and they've found that every batch of pollen that a honeybee collects has at least six detectable pesticides in it  and this includes every class of insecticides  herbicides  fungicides  and even inert and unlabeled ingredients that are part of the pesticide formulation that can be more toxic than the active ingredient. This small bee is holding up a large mirror. How much is it going to take to contaminate humans  One of these class of insecticides  the neonicontinoids  is making headlines around the world right now. You've probably heard about it. This is a new class of insecticides. It moves through the plant so that a crop pest  a leaf eating insect  would take a bite of the plant and get a lethal dose and die. If one of these neonics  we call them  is applied in a high concentration  such as in this ground application  enough of the compound moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and the nectar  where a bee can consume  in this case  a high dose of this neurotoxin that makes the bee twitch and die. In most agricultural settings  on most of our farms  it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide  and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and nectar  and if a bee consumes this lower dose  either nothing happens or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented and she may not find her way home. And on top of everything else  bees have their own set of diseases and parasites. Public enemy number one for bees is this thing. It's called varroa destructor. It's aptly named. It's this big  blood sucking parasite that compromises the bee's immune system and circulates viruses. Let me put this all together for you. I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a big  bloodsucking parasite running around on it  and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus  but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus  the flu  and I know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition. But what if I lived in a food desert  And what if I had to travel a long distance to get to the grocery store  and I finally got my weak body out there and I consumed  in my food  enough of a pesticide  a neurotoxin  that I couldn't find my way home  And this is what we mean by multiple and interacting causes of death. And it's not just our honeybees. All of our beautiful wild species of bees are at risk  including those tomato pollinating bumblebees. These bees are providing backup for our honeybees. They're providing the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees. We need all of our bees. So what are we going to do  What are we going to do about this big bee bummer that we've created  It turns out  it's hopeful. It's hopeful. Every one of you out there can help bees in two very direct and easy ways. Plant bee friendly flowers  and don't contaminate these flowers  this bee food  with pesticides. So go online and search for flowers that are native to your area and plant them. Plant them in a pot on your doorstep. Plant them in your front yard  in your lawns  in your boulevards. Campaign to have them planted in public gardens  community spaces  meadows. Set aside farmland. We need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season  from spring to fall. We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees  but also for migrating butterflies and birds and other wildlife. And we need to think carefully about putting back in cover crops to nourish our soil and nourish our bees. And we need to diversify our farms. We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt the agricultural food desert and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system that we've created. So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure to a big  huge problem    just go plant flowers    but when bees have access to good nutrition  we have access to good nutrition through their pollination services. And when bees have access to good nutrition  they're better able to engage their own natural defenses  their healthcare  that they have relied on for millions of years. So the beauty of helping bees this way  for me  is that every one of us needs to behave a little bit more like a bee society  an insect society  where each of our individual actions can contribute to a grand solution  an emergent property  that's much greater than the mere sum of our individual actions. So let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large scale change. On behalf of the bees  thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Just a quick question. The latest numbers on the die off of bees  is there any sign of things bottoming out  What's your hope depression level on this  Maria Spivak  Yeah. At least in the United States  an average of    percent of all bee hives are lost every winter. About    years ago  we were at a    percent loss. So it's getting precarious. CA  That's not    percent a year  that's    MS  Yes  thirty percent a year. CA  Thirty percent a year. MS  But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies and so they can maintain the same number  they can recuperate some of their loss. We're kind of at a tipping point. We can't really afford to lose that many more. We need to be really appreciative of all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers. CA  Thank you. Eric Berlow  I'm an ecologist  and Sean's a physicist  and we both study complex networks. And we met a couple years ago when we discovered that we had both given a short TED Talk about the ecology of war  and we realized that we were connected by the ideas we shared before we ever met. And then we thought  you know  there are thousands of other talks out there  especially TEDx Talks  that are popping up all over the world. How are they connected  and what does that global conversation look like  So Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that. Sean Gourley  Exactly. So we took        TEDx Talks from around the world      different countries  and we took these talks and we wanted to find the mathematical structures that underly the ideas behind them. And we wanted to do that so we could see how they connected with each other. And so  of course  if you're going to do this kind of stuff  you need a lot of data. So the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube  and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from YouTube  all the comments  all the views  who's watching it  where are they watching it  what are they saying in the comments. But we can also pull up  using speech to text translation  we can pull the entire transcript  and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself. So we can take their transcript and actually do some pretty cool things. We can take natural language processing algorithms to kind of read through with a computer  line by line  extracting key concepts from this. And we take those key concepts and they sort of form this mathematical structure of an idea. And we call that the meme ome. And the meme ome  you know  quite simply  is the mathematics that underlies an idea  and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it  which I want to share with you now. So each idea has its own meme ome  and each idea is unique with that  but of course  ideas  they borrow from each other  they kind of steal sometimes  and they certainly build on each other  and we can go through mathematically and take the meme ome from one talk and compare it to the meme ome from every other talk  and if there's a similarity between the two of them  we can create a link and represent that as a graph  just like Eric and I are connected. So that's theory  that's great. Let's see how it works in actual practice. So what we've got here now is the global footprint of all the TEDx Talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner. And what we did on this is we analyzed the top    percent of these  and we started to see where the connections occurred  where they connected with each other. Cameron Russell talking about image and beauty connected over into Europe. We've got a bigger conversation about Israel and Palestine radiating outwards from the Middle East. And we've got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint reminiscent of a conversation that is happening everywhere. So from this  we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection  but luckily  computer technology allows us to go out into multidimensional space. So we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this  and the similar talks kind of smash together  and the different ones fly apart  and what we're left with is something quite beautiful. EB  So I want to just point out here that every node is a talk  they're linked if they share similar ideas  and that comes from a machine reading of entire talk transcripts  and then all these topics that pop out  they're not from tags and keywords. They come from the network structure of interconnected ideas. Keep going. SG  Absolutely. So I got a little quick on that  but he's going to slow me down. We've got education connected to storytelling triangulated next to social media. You've got  of course  the human brain right next to healthcare  which you might expect  but also you've got video games  which is sort of adjacent  as those two spaces interface with each other. But I want to take you into one cluster that's particularly important to me  and that's the environment. And I want to kind of zoom in on that and see if we can get a little more resolution. So as we go in here  what we start to see  apply the physics engine again  we see what's one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones. The structure starts to emerge where we see a kind of fractal behavior of the words and the language that we use to describe the things that are important to us all around this world. So you've got food economy and local food at the top  you've got greenhouse gases  solar and nuclear waste. What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations  each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share  creating a broader concept of the environment. And of course  from here  we can go and zoom in and see  well  what are young people looking at  And they're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion. This is their kind of resonance for the conversation around the environment. If we split along gender lines  we can see females resonating heavily with food economy  but also out there in hope and optimism. And so there's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here  and I'll throw to Eric for the next part. EB  Yeah  I mean  just to point out here  you cannot get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on YouTube. Let's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment  and look at all the talks together. Now often  when we're faced with this amount of content  we do a couple of things to simplify it. We might just say  well  what are the most popular talks out there  And a few rise to the surface. There's a talk about gratitude. There's another one about personal health and nutrition. And of course  there's got to be one about porn  right  And so then we might say  well  gratitude  that was last year. What's trending now  What's the popular talk now  And we can see that the new  emerging  top trending topic is about digital privacy. So this is great. It simplifies things. But there's so much creative content that's just buried at the bottom. And I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface that's maybe really creative and interesting  Well  we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that. Remember  it's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics  and let's say we could take two of them  like cities and genetics  and say  well  are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines. And that's    Essentially  this kind of creative remix is one of the hallmarks of innovation. Well here's one by Jessica Green about the microbial ecology of buildings. It's literally defining a new field. And we could go back to those topics and say  well  what talks are central to those conversations  In the cities cluster  one of the most central was one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities  and in the genetics cluster  we have a talk about synthetic biology by Craig Venter. These are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline. We could go the other direction and say  well  what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields. We used a measure of ecological diversity to get this. Like  a talk by Steven Pinker on the history of violence  very synthetic. And then  of course  there are talks that are so unique they're kind of out in the stratosphere  in their own special place  and we call that the Colleen Flanagan index. And if you don't know Colleen  she's an artist  and I asked her   Well  what's it like out there in the stratosphere of our idea space   And apparently it smells like bacon. I wouldn't know. So we're using these network motifs to find talks that are unique  ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields  ones that are central to their topic  and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields. Okay  We never would have found those with our obsession with what's trending now. And all of this comes from the architecture of complexity  or the patterns of how things are connected. SG  So that's exactly right. We've got ourselves in a world that's massively complex  and we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it. And those algorithms  whilst being kind of useful  are also very  very narrow  and we can do better than that  because we can realize that their complexity is not random. It has mathematical structure  and we can use that mathematical structure to go and explore things like the world of ideas to see what's being said  to see what's not being said  and to be a little bit more human and  hopefully  a little smarter. Thank you. When my father and I started a company to  D print human tissues and organs  some people initially thought we were a little crazy. But since then  much progress has been made  both in our lab and other labs around the world. And given this  we started getting questions like   If you can grow human body parts  can you also grow animal products like meat and leather   When someone first suggested this to me  quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy  but what I soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all. What's crazy is what we do today. I'm convinced that in    years  when we look back on today and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals to make our hamburgers and our handbags  we'll see this as being wasteful and indeed crazy. Did you know that today we maintain a global herd of    billion animals to provide our meat  dairy  eggs and leather goods  And over the next few decades  as the world's population expands to    billion  this will need to nearly double to     billion animals. But maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet. Animals are not just raw materials. They're living beings  and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land  fresh water  and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases which drive climate change. On top of this  when you get so many animals so close together  it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse. Clearly  we cannot continue on this path which puts the environment  public health  and food security at risk. There is another way  because essentially  animal products are just collections of tissues  and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues. What if  instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal  we started with what the tissues are made of  the basic unit of life  the cell  This is biofabrication  where cells themselves can be used to grow biological products like tissues and organs. Already in medicine  biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts  like ears  windpipes  skin  blood vessels and bone  that have been successfully implanted into patients. And beyond medicine  biofabrication can be a humane  sustainable and scalable new industry. And we should begin by reimagining leather. I emphasize leather because it is so widely used. It is beautiful  and it has long been a part of our history. Growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat. It mainly uses one cell type  and it is largely two dimensional. It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators. Until biofabrication is better understood  it is clear that  initially at least  more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat novel foods  no matter how delicious. In this sense  leather is a gateway material  a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry. If we can succeed here  it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon. Now how do we do it  To grow leather  we begin by taking cells from an animal  through a simple biopsy. The animal could be a cow  lamb  or even something more exotic. This process does no harm  and Daisy the cow can live a happy life. We then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium. This takes millions of cells and expands them into billions. And we then coax these cells to produce collagen  as they would naturally. This collagen is the stuff between cells. It's natural connective tissue. It's the extracellular matrix  but in leather  it's the main building block. And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets  and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another  like phyllo pastry  to form thicker sheets  which we then let mature. And finally  we take this multilayered skin and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process  we create leather. And so I'm very excited to show you  for the first time  the first batch of our cultured leather  fresh from the lab. This is real  genuine leather  without the animal sacrifice. It can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells  and better yet  there is no hair to remove  no scars or insect's bites  and no waste. This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet  a handbag or a car seat. It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator. And because we make this material  we grow this leather from the ground up  we can control its properties in very interesting ways. This piece of leather is a mere seven tissue layers thick  and as you can see  it is nearly transparent. And this leather is    layers thick and quite opaque. You don't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather. And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities  like softness  breathability  durability  elasticity and even things like pattern. We can mimic nature  but in some ways also improve upon it. This type of leather can do what today's leather does  but with imagination  probably much more. What could the future of animal products look like  It need not look like this  which is actually the state of the art today. Rather  it could be much more like this. Already  we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years  beginning with products like wine  beer and yogurt. And speaking of food  our cultured food has evolved  and today we prepare cultured food in beautiful  sterile facilities like this. A brewery is essentially a bioreactor. It is where cell culture takes place. Imagine that in this facility  instead of brewing beer  we were brewing leather or meat. Imagine touring this facility  learning about how the leather or meat is cultured  seeing the process from beginning to end  and even trying some. It's clean  open and educational  and this is in contrast to the hidden  guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today. Perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind. It's environmentally responsible  efficient and humane. It allows us to be creative. We can design new materials  new products  and new facilities. We need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved. Perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured. Thank you. Democracy is in trouble  no question about that  and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded. It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions we face that have to do with global pandemics  a cross border problem  with HIV  a transnational problem  with markets and immigration  something that goes beyond national borders  with terrorism  with war  all now cross border problems. In fact  we live in a   st century world of interdependence  and brutal interdependent problems  and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy  we are faced with political institutions designed     years ago  autonomous  sovereign nation states with jurisdictions and territories separate from one another  each claiming to be able to solve the problem of its own people. Twenty first century  transnational world of problems and challenges    th century world of political institutions. In that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy. And like many others  I've been thinking about what can one do about this  this asymmetry between   st century challenges and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional political institutions like nation states. And my suggestion is that we change the subject  that we stop talking about nations  about bordered states  and we start talking about cities. Because I think you will find  when we talk about cities  we are talking about the political institutions in which civilization and culture were born. We are talking about the cradle of democracy. We are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together to create democracy  and at the same time protest those who would take our freedom  take place. Think of some great names  the Place de la Bastille  Zuccotti Park  Tahrir Square  Taksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul  or  yes  Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Those are the public spaces where we announce ourselves as citizens  as participants  as people with the right to write our own narratives. Cities are not only the oldest of institutions  they're the most enduring. If you think about it  Constantinople  Istanbul  much older than Turkey. Alexandria  much older than Egypt. Rome  far older than Italy. Cities endure the ages. They are the places where we are born  grow up  are educated  work  marry  pray  play  get old  and in time  die. They are home. Very different than nation states  which are abstractions. We pay taxes  we vote occasionally  we watch the men and women we choose rule rule more or less without us. Not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live. Moreover  today  more than half of the world's population live in cities. In the developed world  it's about    percent. More than three out of four people live in urban institutions  urban places  in cities today. So cities are where the action is. Cities are us. Aristotle said in the ancient world  man is a political animal. I say we are an urban animal. We are an urban species  at home in our cities. So to come back to the dilemma  if the dilemma is we have old fashioned political nation states unable to govern the world  respond to the global challenges that we face like climate change  then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world  for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent to engage in global governance. When I say if mayors ruled the world  when I first came up with that phrase  it occurred to me that actually  they already do. There are scores of international  inter city  cross border institutions  networks of cities in which cities are already  quite quietly  below the horizon  working together to deal with climate change  to deal with security  to deal with immigration  to deal with all of those tough  interdependent problems that we face. They have strange names  UCLG  United Cities and Local Governments  ICLEI  the International Council for Local Environmental Issues. And the list goes on  Citynet in Asia  City Protocol  a new organization out of Barcelona that is using the web to share best practices among countries. And then all the things we know a little better  the U.S. Conference of Mayors  the Mexican Conference of Mayors  the European Conference of Mayors. Mayors are where this is happening. And so the question is  how can we create a world in which mayors and the citizens they represent play a more prominent role  Well  to understand that  we need to understand why cities are special  why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents  because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum. To be a prime minister or a president  you have to have an ideology  you have to have a meta narrative  you have to have a theory of how things work  you have to belong to a party. Independents  on the whole  don't get elected to office. But mayors are just the opposite. Mayors are pragmatists  they're problem solvers. Their job is to get things done  and if they don't  they're out of a job. Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said  we could never get away here in Philadelphia with the stuff that goes on in Washington  the paralysis  the non action  the inaction. Why  Because potholes have to get filled  because the trains have to run  because kids have to be able to get to school. And that's what we have to do  and to do that is about pragmatism in that deep  American sense  reaching outcomes. Washington  Beijing  Paris  as world capitals  are anything but pragmatic  but real city mayors have to be pragmatists. They have to get things done  they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside and draw their cities together. We saw this a couple of decades ago when Teddy Kollek  the great mayor of Jerusalem in the '  s and the '  s  was besieged one day in his office by religious leaders from all of the backgrounds  Christian prelates  rabbis  imams. They were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites. And the squabble went on and on  and Kollek listened and listened  and he finally said   Gentlemen  spare me your sermons  and I will fix your sewers.  That's what mayors do. They fix sewers  they get the trains running. There isn't a left or a right way of doing. Boris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho Tory. Strange term  but in some ways  he is. He's a libertarian. He's an anarchist. He rides to work on a bike  but at the same time  he's in some ways a conservative. Bloomberg in New York was a Democrat  then he was a Republican  and finally he was an Independent  and said the party label just gets in the way. Luzhkov     years mayor in Moscow  though he helped found a party  United Party with Putin  in fact refused to be defined by the party and finally  in fact  lost his job not under Brezhnev  not under Gorbachev  but under Putin  who wanted a more faithful party follower. So mayors are pragmatists and problem solvers. They get things done. But the second thing about mayors is they are also what I like to call homeboys  or to include the women mayors  homies. They're from the neighborhood. They're part of the neighborhood. They're known. Ed Koch used to wander around New York City saying   How am I doing   Imagine David Cameron wandering around the United Kingdom asking   How am I doing   He wouldn't like the answer. Or Putin. Or any national leader. He could ask that because he knew New Yorkers and they knew him. Mayors are usually from the places they govern. It's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor. You can run for the Senate out of a different state  but it's hard to do that as a mayor. And as a result  mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level  and this is the third feature about mayors  than national governing officials. In the United States  we know the pathetic figures     percent of Americans approve of Congress and what they do. And even with a relatively popular president like Obama  the figures for the Presidency run about         sometimes    percent at best. The Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be. But when you ask   Do you trust your city councillor  do you trust your mayor   the rates shoot up to         even    percent  because they're from the neighborhood  because the people they work with are their neighbors  because  like Mayor Booker in Newark  a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work and go in and pull people out of a burning building    that happened to Mayor Booker    or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work because he sees it. No head of state would be permitted by their security details to do it  nor be in a position to do it. That's the difference  and the difference has to do with the character of cities themselves  because cities are profoundly multicultural  open  participatory  democratic  able to work with one another. When states face each other  China and the U.S.  they face each other like this. When cities interact  they interact like this. China and the U.S.  despite the recent meta meeting in California  are locked in all kinds of anger  resentment  and rivalry for number one. We heard more about who will be number one. Cities don't worry about number one. They have to work together  and they do work together. They work together in climate change  for example. Organizations like the C    like ICLEI  which I mentioned  have been working together many  many years before Copenhagen. In Copenhagen  four or five years ago      nations came together to explain to one another why their sovereignty didn't permit them to deal with the grave  grave crisis of climate change  but the mayor of Copenhagen had invited     mayors to attend. They came  they stayed  and they found ways and are still finding ways to work together  city to city  and through inter city organizations. Eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities  which means cities are in a position to solve the carbon problem  or most of it  whether or not the states of which they are a part make agreements with one another. And they are doing it. Los Angeles cleaned up its port  which was    percent of carbon emissions  and as a result got rid of about    percent of carbon. New York has a program to upgrade its old buildings  make them better insulated in the winter  to not leak energy in the summer  not leak air conditioning. That's having an impact. Bogota  where Mayor Mockus  when he was mayor  he introduced a transportation system that saved energy  that allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways  express buses with corridors. It helped unemployment  because people could get across town  and it had a profound impact on climate as well as many other things there. Singapore  as it developed its high rises and its remarkable public housing  also developed an island of parks  and if you go there  you'll see how much of it is green land and park land. Cities are doing this  but not just one by one. They are doing it together. They are sharing what they do  and they are making a difference by shared best practices. Bike shares  many of you have heard of it  started    or    years ago in Latin America. Now it's in hundreds of cities around the world. Pedestrian zones  congestion fees  emission limits in cities like California cities have  there's lots and lots that cities can do even when opaque  stubborn nations refuse to act. So what's the bottom line here  The bottom line is  we still live politically in a world of borders  a world of boundaries  a world of walls  a world where states refuse to act together. Yet we know that the reality we experience day to day is a world without borders  a world of diseases without borders and doctors without borders  maladies sans fronti res  M decins Sans Fronti res  of economics and technology without borders  of education without borders  of terrorism and war without borders. That is the real world  and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or democratize globalization  we will increasingly not only risk the failure to address all of these transnational problems  but we will risk losing democracy itself  locked up in the old nation state box  unable to address global problems democratically. So where does that leave us  I'll tell you. The road to global democracy doesn't run through states. It runs through cities. Democracy was born in the ancient polis. I believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis. In that journey from polis to cosmopolis  we can rediscover the power of democracy on a global level. We can create not a League of Nations  which failed  but a League of Cities  not a United or a dis United Nations  but United Cities of the World. We can create a global parliament of mayors. That's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world  but it's also on the table in City Halls in Seoul  Korea  in Amsterdam  in Hamburg  and in New York. Mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually constitute a global parliament of mayors  and I love that idea  because a parliament of mayors is a parliament of citizens and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us  of you and of me. If ever there were citizens without borders  I think it's the citizens of TED who show the promise to be those citizens without borders. I am ready to reach out and embrace a new global democracy  to take back our democracy. And the only question is  are you  Thank you so much  my fellow citizens. Thank you.  Applause  I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on involving a man named Steve Titus. Titus was a restaurant manager. He was    years old  he lived in Seattle  Washington  he was engaged to Gretchen  about to be married  she was the love of his life. And one night  the couple went out for a romantic restaurant meal. They were on their way home  and they were pulled over by a police officer. You see  Titus' car sort of resembled a car that was driven earlier in the evening by a man who raped a female hitchhiker  and Titus kind of resembled that rapist. So the police took a picture of Titus  they put it in a photo lineup  they later showed it to the victim  and she pointed to Titus' photo. She said   That one's the closest.  The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial  and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape  the rape victim got on the stand and said   I'm absolutely positive that's the man.  And Titus was convicted. He proclaimed his innocence  his family screamed at the jury  his fianc e collapsed on the floor sobbing  and Titus is taken away to jail. So what would you do at this point  What would you do  Well  Titus lost complete faith in the legal system  and yet he got an idea. He called up the local newspaper  he got the interest of an investigative journalist  and that journalist actually found the real rapist  a man who ultimately confessed to this rape  a man who was thought to have committed    rapes in that area  and when this information was given to the judge  the judge set Titus free. And really  that's where this case should have ended. It should have been over. Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year  a year of accusation and trial  but over. It didn't end that way. Titus was so bitter. He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back. He lost his fianc e. She couldn't put up with his persistent anger. He lost his entire savings  and so he decided to file a lawsuit against the police and others whom he felt were responsible for his suffering. And that's when I really started working on this case  trying to figure out how did that victim go from  That one's the closest  to  I'm absolutely positive that's the guy.  Well  Titus was consumed with his civil case. He spent every waking moment thinking about it  and just days before he was to have his day in court  he woke up in the morning  doubled over in pain  and died of a stress related heart attack. He was    years old. So I was asked to work on Titus' case because I'm a psychological scientist. I study memory. I've studied memory for decades. And if I meet somebody on an airplane    this happened on the way over to Scotland    if I meet somebody on an airplane  and we ask each other   What do you do  What do you do   and I say  I study memory   they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names  or they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's or some kind of memory problem  but I have to tell them I don't study when people forget. I study the opposite  when they remember  when they remember things that didn't happen or remember things that were different from the way they really were. I study false memories. Unhappily  Steve Titus is not the only person to be convicted based on somebody's false memory. In one project in the United States  information has been gathered on     innocent people      defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do. They spent            years in prison for these crimes  and now DNA testing has proven that they are actually innocent. And when those cases have been analyzed  three quarters of them are due to faulty memory  faulty eyewitness memory. Well  why  Like the jurors who convicted those innocent people and the jurors who convicted Titus  many people believe that memory works like a recording device. You just record the information  then you call it up and play it back when you want to answer questions or identify images. But decades of work in psychology has shown that this just isn't true. Our memories are constructive. They're reconstructive. Memory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page  You can go in there and change it  but so can other people. I first started studying this constructive memory process in the     s. I did my experiments that involved showing people simulated crimes and accidents and asking them questions about what they remember. In one study  we showed people a simulated accident and we asked people  how fast were the cars going when they hit each other  And we asked other people  how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other  And if we asked the leading  smashed  question  the witnesses told us the cars were going faster  and moreover  that leading  smashed  question caused people to be more likely to tell us that they saw broken glass in the accident scene when there wasn't any broken glass at all. In another study  we showed a simulated accident where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign  and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign  many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign at the intersection  not a stop sign. And you might be thinking  well  you know  these are filmed events  they are not particularly stressful. Would the same kind of mistakes be made with a really stressful event  In a study we published just a few months ago  we have an answer to this question  because what was unusual about this study is we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience. The subjects in this study were members of the U.S. military who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise to teach them what it's going to be like for them if they are ever captured as prisoners of war. And as part of this training exercise  these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive  hostile  physically abusive fashion for    minutes and later on they have to try to identify the person who conducted that interrogation. And when we feed them suggestive information that insinuates it's a different person  many of them misidentify their interrogator  often identifying someone who doesn't even remotely resemble the real interrogator. And so what these studies are showing is that when you feed people misinformation about some experience that they may have had  you can distort or contaminate or change their memory. Well out there in the real world  misinformation is everywhere. We get misinformation not only if we're questioned in a leading way  but if we talk to other witnesses who might consciously or inadvertently feed us some erroneous information  or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced  all of these provide the opportunity for this kind of contamination of our memory. In the     s  we began to see an even more extreme kind of memory problem. Some patients were going into therapy with one problem    maybe they had depression  an eating disorder    and they were coming out of therapy with a different problem. Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations  sometimes in satanic rituals  sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements. One woman came out of psychotherapy believing that she'd endured years of ritualistic abuse  where she was forced into a pregnancy and that the baby was cut from her belly. But there were no physical scars or any kind of physical evidence that could have supported her story. And when I began looking into these cases  I was wondering  where do these bizarre memories come from  And what I found is that most of these situations involved some particular form of psychotherapy. And so I asked  were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy    like the imagination exercises or dream interpretation  or in some cases hypnosis  or in some cases exposure to false information    were these leading these patients to develop these very bizarre  unlikely memories  And I designed some experiments to try to study the processes that were being used in this psychotherapy so I could study the development of these very rich false memories. In one of the first studies we did  we used suggestion  a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases  we used this kind of suggestion and planted a false memory that when you were a kid  five or six years old  you were lost in a shopping mall. You were frightened. You were crying. You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person and reunited with the family. And we succeeded in planting this memory in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects. And you might be thinking  well  that's not particularly stressful. But we and other investigators have planted rich false memories of things that were much more unusual and much more stressful. So in a study done in Tennessee  researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid  you nearly drowned and had to be rescued by a life guard. And in a study done in Canada  researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid  something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal happened to you  succeeding with about half of their subjects. And in a study done in Italy  researchers planted the false memory  when you were a kid  you witnessed demonic possession. I do want to add that it might seem like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects in the name of science  but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation by research ethics boards that have made the decision that the temporary discomfort that some of these subjects might experience in these studies is outweighed by the importance of this problem for understanding memory processes and the abuse of memory that is going on in some places in the world. Well  to my surprise  when I published this work and began to speak out against this particular brand of psychotherapy  it created some pretty bad problems for me  hostilities  primarily from the repressed memory therapists  who felt under attack  and by the patients whom they had influenced. I had sometimes armed guards at speeches that I was invited to give  people trying to drum up letter writing campaigns to get me fired. But probably the worst was I suspected that a woman was innocent of abuse that was being claimed by her grown daughter. She accused her mother of sexual abuse based on a repressed memory. And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story to be filmed and presented in public places. I was suspicious of this story  and so I started to investigate  and eventually found information that convinced me that this mother was innocent. I published an expos  on the case  and a little while later  the accusing daughter filed a lawsuit. Even though I'd never mentioned her name  she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy. And I went through nearly five years of dealing with this messy  unpleasant litigation  but finally  finally  it was over and I could really get back to my work. In the process  however  I became part of a disturbing trend in America where scientists are being sued for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy. When I got back to my work  I asked this question  if I plant a false memory in your mind  does it have repercussions  Does it affect your later thoughts  your later behaviors  Our first study planted a false memory that you got sick as a child eating certain foods  hard boiled eggs  dill pickles  strawberry ice cream. And we found that once we planted this false memory  people didn't want to eat the foods as much at an outdoor picnic. The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant. If we planted a warm  fuzzy memory involving a healthy food like asparagus  we could get people to want to eat asparagus more. And so what these studies are showing is that you can plant false memories and they have repercussions that affect behavior long after the memories take hold. Well  along with this ability to plant memories and control behavior obviously come some important ethical issues  like  when should we use this mind technology  And should we ever ban its use  Therapists can't ethically plant false memories in the mind of their patients even if it would help the patient  but there's nothing to stop a parent from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager. And when I suggested this publicly  it created an outcry again.  There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children.  Hello  Santa Claus.  Laughter  I mean  another way to think about this is  which would you rather have  a kid with obesity  diabetes  shortened lifespan  all the things that go with it  or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory  I know what I would choose for a kid of mine. But maybe my work has made me different from most people. Most people cherish their memories  know that they represent their identity  who they are  where they came from. And I appreciate that. I feel that way too. But I know from my work how much fiction is already in there. If I've learned anything from these decades of working on these problems  it's this  just because somebody tells you something and they say it with confidence  just because they say it with lots of detail  just because they express emotion when they say it  it doesn't mean that it really happened. We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories. We need independent corroboration. Such a discovery has made me more tolerant of the everyday memory mistakes that my friends and family members make. Such a discovery might have saved Steve Titus  the man whose whole future was snatched away by a false memory. But meanwhile  we should all keep in mind  we'd do well to  that memory  like liberty  is a fragile thing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thanks very much.  Applause  There is an ancient proverb that says it's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room  especially when there is no cat. I find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works    bumbling around in a dark room  bumping into things  trying to figure out what shape this might be  what that might be  there are reports of a cat somewhere around  they may not be reliable  they may be  and so forth and so on. Now I know this is different than the way most people think about science. Science  we generally are told  is a very well ordered mechanism for understanding the world  for gaining facts  for gaining data  that it's rule based  that scientists use this thing called the scientific method and we've been doing this for    generations or so now  and the scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard  cold facts out of the data. I'd like to tell you that's not the case. So there's the scientific method  but what's really going on is this.  Laughter   The Scientific Method vs. Farting Around  And it's going on kind of like that.  ... in the dark   Laughter  So what is the difference  then  between the way I believe science is pursued and the way it seems to be perceived  So this difference first came to me in some ways in my dual role at Columbia University  where I'm both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience where we try to figure out how the brain works. We do this by studying the sense of smell  the sense of olfaction  and in the laboratory  it's a great pleasure and fascinating work and exciting to work with graduate students and post docs and think up cool experiments to understand how this sense of smell works and how the brain might be working  and  well  frankly  it's kind of exhilarating. But at the same time  it's my responsibility to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain  and that's a big subject  and it takes quite a while to organize that  and it's quite challenging and it's quite interesting  but I have to say  it's not so exhilarating. So what was the difference  Well  the course I was and am teaching is called Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience   I.  Laughs  It's    lectures full of all sorts of facts  it uses this giant book called  Principles of Neural Science  by three famous neuroscientists. This book comes in at       pages  it weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds. Just to put that in some perspective  that's the weight of two normal human brains. So I began to realize  by the end of this course  that the students maybe were getting the idea that we must know everything there is to know about the brain. That's clearly not true. And they must also have this idea  I suppose  that what scientists do is collect data and collect facts and stick them in these big books. And that's not really the case either. When I go to a meeting  after the meeting day is over and we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues  we never talk about what we know. We talk about what we don't know. We talk about what still has to get done  what's so critical to get done in the lab. Indeed  this was  I think  best said by Marie Curie who said that one never notices what has been done but only what remains to be done. This was in a letter to her brother after obtaining her second graduate degree  I should say. I have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie  because I am convinced that that glow behind her is not a photographic effect.  Laughter  That's the real thing. It is true that her papers are  to this day  stored in a basement room in the Biblioth que Fran aise in a concrete room that's lead lined  and if you're a scholar and you want access to these notebooks  you have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit  so it's pretty scary business. Nonetheless  this is what I think we were leaving out of our courses and leaving out of the interaction that we have with the public as scientists  the what remains to be done. This is the stuff that's exhilarating and interesting. It is  if you will  the ignorance. That's what was missing. So I thought  well  maybe I should teach a course on ignorance  something I can finally excel at  perhaps  for example. So I did start teaching this course on ignorance  and it's been quite interesting and I'd like to tell you to go to the website. You can find all sorts of information there. It's wide open. And it's been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about what it is they don't know. Now I use this word  ignorance   of course  to be at least in part intentionally provocative  because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and I clearly don't mean any of those. So I don't mean stupidity  I don't mean a callow indifference to fact or reason or data. The ignorant are clearly unenlightened  unaware  uninformed  and present company today excepted  often occupy elected offices  it seems to me. That's another story  perhaps. I mean a different kind of ignorance. I mean a kind of ignorance that's less pejorative  a kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge  something that's just not there to be known or isn't known well enough yet or we can't make predictions from  the kind of ignorance that's maybe best summed up in a statement by James Clerk Maxwell  perhaps the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein  who said   Thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real advance in science.  I think it's a wonderful idea  thoroughly conscious ignorance. So that's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today  but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts  So it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate. We all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts  this accumulation model of science  as many have called it  and it seems impregnable  it seems impossible. How can you ever know all of this  And indeed  the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate. In       there were  .  million papers published. There's about a two and a half percent yearly growth rate  and so last year we saw over one and a half million papers being published. Divide that by the number of minutes in a year  and you wind up with three new papers per minute. So I've been up here a little over    minutes  I've already lost three papers. I have to get out of here actually. I have to go read. So what do we do about this  Well  the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect  if you will. We just don't worry about it  in a way. The facts are important. You have to know a lot of stuff to be a scientist. That's true. But knowing a lot of stuff doesn't make you a scientist. You need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter. But in science  knowing a lot of stuff is not the point. Knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get to more ignorance. So knowledge is a big subject  but I would say ignorance is a bigger one. So this leads us to maybe think about  a little bit about  some of the models of science that we tend to use  and I'd like to disabuse you of some of them. So one of them  a popular one  is that scientists are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together to reveal some grand scheme or another. This is clearly not true. For one  with puzzles  the manufacturer has guaranteed that there's a solution. We don't have any such guarantee. Indeed  there are many of us who aren't so sure about the manufacturer. So I think the puzzle model doesn't work. Another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things the way you unravel the peels of an onion. So peel by peel  you take away the layers of the onion to get at some fundamental kernel of truth. I don't think that's the way it works either. Another one  a kind of popular one  is the iceberg idea  that we only see the tip of the iceberg but underneath is where most of the iceberg is hidden. But all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts that we can somehow or another get completed. We can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is  or we could just wait for it to melt  I suppose  these days  but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg. Right  Or make it manageable. But I don't think that's the case. I think what really happens in science is a model more like the magic well  where no matter how many buckets you take out  there's always another bucket of water to be had  or my particularly favorite one  with the effect and everything  the ripples on a pond. So if you think of knowledge being this ever expanding ripple on a pond  the important thing to realize is that our ignorance  the circumference of this knowledge  also grows with knowledge. So the knowledge generates ignorance. This is really well said  I thought  by George Bernard Shaw. This is actually part of a toast that he delivered to celebrate Einstein at a dinner celebrating Einstein's work  in which he claims that science just creates more questions than it answers.   Science is always wrong. It never solves a problem without creating    more.   I find that kind of glorious  and I think he's precisely right  plus it's a kind of job security. As it turns out  he kind of cribbed that from the philosopher Immanuel Kant who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea of question propagation  that every answer begets more questions. I love that term   question propagation   this idea of questions propagating out there. So I'd say the model we want to take is not that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together and then we gain knowledge. It's rather kind of the other way around  really. What do we use this knowledge for  What are we using this collection of facts for  We're using it to make better ignorance  to come up with  if you will  higher quality ignorance. Because  you know  there's low quality ignorance and there's high quality ignorance. It's not all the same. Scientists argue about this all the time. Sometimes we call them bull sessions. Sometimes we call them grant proposals. But nonetheless  it's what the argument is about. It's the ignorance. It's the what we don't know. It's what makes a good question. So how do we think about these questions  I'm going to show you a graph that shows up quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments. This graph asks the relationship between what you know and how much you know about it. So what you know  you can know anywhere from nothing to everything  of course  and how much you know about it can be anywhere from a little to a lot. So let's put a point on the graph. There's an undergraduate. Doesn't know much but they have a lot of interest. They're interested in almost everything. Now you look at a master's student  a little further along in their education  and you see they know a bit more  but it's been narrowed somewhat. And finally you get your Ph.D.  where it turns out you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing.  Laughter  What's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that because  of course  when it dips below the zero axis  there  it gets into a negative area. That's where you find people like me  I'm afraid. So the important thing here is that this can all be changed. This whole view can be changed by just changing the label on the x axis. So instead of how much you know about it  we could say   What can you ask about it   So yes  you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist  but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff is not just to know a lot of stuff. That just makes you a geek  right  Knowing a lot of stuff  the purpose is to be able to ask lots of questions  to be able to frame thoughtful  interesting questions  because that's where the real work is. Let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions. I'm a neuroscientist  so how would we come up with a question in neuroscience  Because it's not always quite so straightforward. So  for example  we could say  well what is it that the brain does  Well  one thing the brain does  it moves us around. We walk around on two legs. That seems kind of simple  somehow or another. I mean  virtually everybody over    months of age walks around on two legs  right  So that maybe is not that interesting. So instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at. How about the visual system  There it is  the visual system. I mean  we love our visual systems. We do all kinds of cool stuff. Indeed  there are over        neuroscientists who work on the visual system  from the retina to the visual cortex  in an attempt to understand not just the visual system but to also understand how general principles of how the brain might work. But now here's the thing  Our technology has actually been pretty good at replicating what the visual system does. We have TV  we have movies  we have animation  we have photography  we have pattern recognition  all of these sorts of things. They work differently than our visual systems in some cases  but nonetheless we've been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system. Somehow or another  a hundred years of robotics  you never saw a robot walk on two legs  because robots don't walk on two legs because it's not such an easy thing to do. A hundred years of robotics  and we can't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other. You ask them to go up an inclined plane  and they fall over. Turn around  and they fall over. It's a serious problem. So what is it that's the most difficult thing for a brain to do  What ought we to be studying  Perhaps it ought to be walking on two legs  or the motor system. I'll give you an example from my own lab  my own particularly smelly question  since we work on the sense of smell. But here's a diagram of five molecules and sort of a chemical notation. These are just plain old molecules  but if you sniff those molecules up these two little holes in the front of your face  you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose. If there's a real rose there  those molecules will be the ones  but even if there's no rose there  you'll have the memory of a molecule. How do we turn molecules into perceptions  What's the process by which that could happen  Here's another example  two very simple molecules  again in this kind of chemical notation. It might be easier to visualize them this way  so the gray circles are carbon atoms  the white ones are hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms. Now these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom and two little hydrogen atoms that ride along with it  and yet one of them  heptyl acetate  has the distinct odor of a pear  and hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana. So there are two really interesting questions here  it seems to me. One is  how can a simple little molecule like that create a perception in your brain that's so clear as a pear or a banana  And secondly  how the hell can we tell the difference between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom  I mean  that's remarkable to me  clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet. And you don't even think about it  do you  So this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us back to the ignorance and the idea of questions. I like to quote because I think dead people shouldn't be excluded from the conversation. And I also think it's important to realize that the conversation's been going on for a while  by the way. So Erwin Schrodinger  a great quantum physicist and  I think  philosopher  points out how you have to  abide by ignorance for an indefinite period  of time. And it's this abiding by ignorance that I think we have to learn how to do. This is a tricky thing. This is not such an easy business. I guess it comes down to our education system  so I'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education  because I think that's where it really has to play out. So for one  let's face it  in the age of Google and Wikipedia  the business model of the university and probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change. We just can't sell facts for a living anymore. They're available with a click of the mouse  or if you want to  you could probably just ask the wall one of these days  wherever they're going to hide the things that tell us all this stuff. So what do we have to do  We have to give our students a taste for the boundaries  for what's outside that circumference  for what's outside the facts  what's just beyond the facts. How do we do that  Well  one of the problems  of course  turns out to be testing. We currently have an educational system which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing. So in second grade  all the kids are interested in science  the girls and the boys. They like to take stuff apart. They have great curiosity. They like to investigate things. They go to science museums. They like to play around. They're in second grade. They're interested. But by   th or   th grade  fewer than    percent of them have any interest in science whatsoever  let alone a desire to go into science as a career. So we have this remarkably efficient system for beating any interest in science out of everybody's head. Is this what we want  I think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine calls  the bulimic method of education.  You know. You can imagine what it is. We just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here and then they puke it up on an exam over here and everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever. This can't possibly continue to go on. So what do we do  Well the geneticists  I have to say  have an interesting maxim they live by. Geneticists always say  you always get what you screen for. And that's meant as a warning. So we always will get what we screen for  and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods. Well  we hear a lot about testing and evaluation  and we have to think carefully when we're testing whether we're evaluating or whether we're weeding  whether we're weeding people out  whether we're making some cut. Evaluation is one thing. You hear a lot about evaluation in the literature these days  in the educational literature  but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts to an opportunity for trial and error. It amounts to a chance to work over a longer period of time with this kind of feedback. That's different than weeding  and usually  I have to tell you  when people talk about evaluation  evaluating students  evaluating teachers  evaluating schools  evaluating programs  that they're really talking about weeding. And that's a bad thing  because then you will get what you select for  which is what we've gotten so far. So I'd say what we need is a test that says   What is x   and the answers are  I don't know  because no one does   or  What's the question   Even better. Or   You know what  I'll look it up  I'll ask someone  I'll phone someone. I'll find out.  Because that's what we want people to do  and that's how you evaluate them. And maybe for the advanced placement classes  it could be   Here's the answer. What's the next question   That's the one I like in particular. So let me end with a quote from William Butler Yeats  who said  Education is not about filling buckets  it is lighting fires.  So I'd say  let's get out the matches. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  So I'm going to talk about trust  and I'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust. I think these are so commonplace  they've become clich s of our society. And I think there are three. One's a claim  there has been a great decline in trust  very widely believed. The second is an aim  we should have more trust. And the third is a task  we should rebuild trust. I think that the claim  the aim and the task are all misconceived. So what I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim  an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter. First the claim  Why do people think trust has declined  And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence  I don't know the answer. I'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others. I don't have an overview. But  of course  I can look at the opinion polls  and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined. When you actually look at opinion polls across time  there's not much evidence for that. That's to say  the people who were mistrusted    years ago  principally journalists and politicians  are still mistrusted. And the people who were highly trusted    years ago are still rather highly trusted  judges  nurses. The rest of us are in between  and by the way  the average person in the street is almost exactly midway. But is that good evidence  What opinion polls record is  of course  opinions. What else can they record  So they're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions. Do you trust politicians  Do you trust teachers  Now if somebody said to you   Do you trust greengrocers  Do you trust fishmongers  Do you trust elementary school teachers   you would probably begin by saying   To do what   And that would be a perfectly sensible response. And you might say  when you understood the answer to that   Well  I trust some of them  but not others.  That's a perfectly rational thing. In short  in our real lives  we seek to place trust in a differentiated way. We don't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office holder or type of person is going to be uniform. I might  for example  say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to teach the reception class to read  but in no way to drive the school minibus. I might  after all  know that she wasn't a good driver. I might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not    but perhaps not to keep a secret. Simple. So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated  why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly  I think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists  because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust. Secondly  what about the aim  The aim is to have more trust. Well frankly  I think that's a stupid aim. It's not what I would aim at. I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy. In fact  I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy. And I think  of those people who  for example  placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff  who then made off with them  and I think of them  and I think  well  yes  too much trust. More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life. Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim. Well once one says that  one says  yeah  okay  that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness. It's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects. And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things. Are they competent  Are they honest  Are they reliable  And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters  and reliable and honest  we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them  because they'll be trustworthy. But if  on the other hand  they're unreliable  we might not. I have friends who are competent and honest  but I would not trust them to post a letter  because they're forgetful. I have friends who are very confident they can do certain things  but I realize that they overestimate their own competence. And I'm very glad to say  I don't think I have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest. If so  I haven't yet spotted it. But that's what we're looking for  trustworthiness before trust. Trust is the response. Trustworthiness is what we have to judge. And  of course  it's difficult. Across the last few decades  we've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness. A lot of these systems have the converse effect. They don't work as they're supposed to. I remember I was talking with a midwife who said   Well  you see  the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby.  And all over our public life  our institutional life  we find that problem  that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite. It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks  like midwives  from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes  as we say. You can all give your own examples there. So so much for the aim. The aim  I think  is more trustworthiness  and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people  and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office holders or politicians are trustworthy. It's not easy. It is judgment  and simple reaction  attitudes  don't do adequately here. Now thirdly  the task. Calling the task rebuilding trust  I think  also gets things backwards. It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust. Well  we can do that for ourselves. We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness. We can do it two people together trying to improve trust. But trust  in the end  is distinctive because it's given by other people. You can't rebuild what other people give you. You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust. So you have to  I think  be trustworthy. And that  of course  is because you can't fool all of the people all of the time  usually. But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy. How to do it  Well every day  all over the place  it's being done by ordinary people  by officials  by institutions  quite effectively. Let me give you a simple commercial example. The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back  and they don't ask any questions. They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted. That's super. I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me. I think there's a big lesson in that. If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party  then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying. So in the end  I think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern. It is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy. So the moral of all this is  we need to think much less about trust  let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis detected by opinion polls  much more about being trustworthy  and how you give people adequate  useful and simple evidence that you're trustworthy. Thanks. We are going to take a quick voyage over the cognitive history of the   th century  because during that century  our minds have altered dramatically. As you all know  the cars that people drove in      have altered because the roads are better and because of technology. And our minds have altered  too. We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world  and it's a world where we've had to develop new mental habits  new habits of mind. And these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification  introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent  and also taking the hypothetical seriously  that is  wondering about what might have been rather than what is. Now  this dramatic change was drawn to my attention through massive I.Q. gains over time  and these have been truly massive. That is  we don't just get a few more questions right on I.Q. tests. We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented. Indeed  if you score the people a century ago against modern norms  they would have an average I.Q. of   . If you score us against their norms  we would have an average I.Q. of    . Now this has raised all sorts of questions. Were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation  Because    is normally the score for mental retardation. Or are we on the verge of all being gifted  Because     is the cutting line for giftedness. Now I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative that's much more illuminating than either of those  and to put this into perspective  let's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth and found a ruined civilization. And this Martian was an archaeologist  and they found scores  target scores  that people had used for shooting. And first they looked at       and they found that in a minute  people had only put one bullet in the bullseye. And then they found  in       that they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute. And then about      they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye. And initially  that archaeologist would be baffled. They would say  look  these tests were designed to find out how much people were steady of hand  how keen their eyesight was  whether they had control of their weapon. How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree  Well we now know  of course  the answer. If that Martian looked at battlefields  they would find that people had only muskets at the time of the Civil War and that they had repeating rifles at the time of the Spanish American War  and then they had machine guns by the time of World War I. And  in other words  it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible  not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of hand. Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery that we have picked up over those hundred years  and I think again that another thinker will help us here  and that's Luria. Luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age  and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world. They wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use. He found that they were resistant to deducing the hypothetical  to speculating about what might be  and he found finally that they didn't deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions. Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews. He talked to the head man of a person in rural Russia. They'd only had  as people had in       about four years of schooling. And he asked that particular person  what do crows and fish have in common  And the fellow said   Absolutely nothing. You know  I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow. A crow can peck at a fish. A fish can't do anything to a crow.  And Luria said   But aren't they both animals   And he said   Of course not. One's a fish. The other is a bird.  And he was interested  effectively  in what he could do with those concrete objects. And then Luria went to another person  and he said to them   There are no camels in Germany. Hamburg is a city in Germany. Are there camels in Hamburg   And the fellow said   Well  if it's large enough  there ought to be camels there.  And Luria said   But what do my words imply   And he said   Well  maybe it's a small village  and there's no room for camels.  In other words  he was unwilling to treat this as anything but a concrete problem  and he was used to camels being in villages  and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical  to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany. A third interview was conducted with someone about the North Pole. And Luria said   At the North Pole  there is always snow. Wherever there is always snow  the bears are white. What color are the bears at the North Pole   And the response was   Such a thing is to be settled by testimony. If a wise person came from the North Pole and told me the bears were white  I might believe him  but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear.  Now you see again  this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience  and it was important to that person what color bears were    that is  they had to hunt bears. They weren't willing to engage in this. One of them said to Luria   How can we solve things that aren't real problems  None of these problems are real. How can we address them   Now  these three categories    classification  using logic on abstractions  taking the hypothetical seriously    how much difference do they make in the real world beyond the testing room  And let me give you a few illustrations. First  almost all of us today get a high school diploma. That is  we've gone from four to eight years of education to    years of formal education  and    percent of Americans have actually experienced some type of tertiary education. Now  not only do we have much more education  and much of that education is scientific  and you can't do science without classifying the world. You can't do science without proposing hypotheses. You can't do science without making it logically consistent. And even down in grade school  things have changed. In       they looked at the examinations that the state of Ohio gave to    year olds  and they found that they were all for socially valued concrete information. They were things like  what are the capitals of the    or    states that existed at that time  When they looked at the exams that the state of Ohio gave in       they were all about abstractions. They were things like  why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital  And you were supposed to think  well  the state legislature was rural controlled  and they hated the big city  so rather than putting the capital in a big city  they put it in a county seat. They put it in Albany rather than New York. They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia. And so forth. So the tenor of education has changed. We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously  to use abstractions  and to link them logically. What about employment  Well  in       three percent of Americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding. Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers. Today     percent of Americans practice cognitively demanding professions  not only to the professions proper like lawyer or doctor or scientist or lecturer  but many  many sub professions having to do with being a technician  a computer programmer. A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands. And we can only meet the terms of employment in the modern world by being cognitively far more flexible. And it's not just that we have many more people in cognitively demanding professions. The professions have been upgraded. Compare the doctor in       who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve  with the modern general practitioner or specialist  with years of scientific training. Compare the banker in       who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage. Well  the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees may have been morally remiss  but they were cognitively very agile. They went far beyond that      banker. They had to look at computer projections for the housing market. They had to get complicated CDO squared in order to bundle debt together and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset. They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a AAA  though in many cases  they had virtually bribed the rating agencies. And they also  of course  had to get people to accept these so called assets and pay money for them even though they were highly vulnerable. Or take a farmer today. I take the farm manager of today as very different from the farmer of     . So it hasn't just been the spread of cognitively demanding professions. It's also been the upgrading of tasks like lawyer and doctor and what have you that have made demands on our cognitive faculties. But I've talked about education and employment. Some of the habits of mind that we have developed over the   th century have paid off in unexpected areas. I'm primarily a moral philosopher. I merely have a holiday in psychology  and what interests me in general is moral debate. Now over the last century  in developed nations like America  moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously  and we also take universals seriously and look for logical connections. When I came home in      from university at the time of Martin Luther King  a lot of people came home at that time and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents. My father was born in       and he was mildly racially biased. As an Irishman  he hated the English so much he didn't have much emotion for anyone else. But he did have a sense that black people were inferior. And when we said to our parents and grandparents   How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black   they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said. Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning    that turned black  In other words  they were fixed in the concrete mores and attitudes they had inherited. They would not take the hypothetical seriously  and without the hypothetical  it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground. You have to say  imagine you were in Iran  and imagine that your relatives all suffered from collateral damage even though they had done no wrong. How would you feel about that  And if someone of the older generation says  well  our government takes care of us  and it's up to their government to take care of them  they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously. Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped  and he feels he's honor bound to kill her. Well  he's treating his mores as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited  and they're unmovable in any way by logic. They're just inherited mores. Today we would say something like  well  imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized. Would you deserve to be killed  And he would say  well that's not in the Koran. That's not one of the principles I've got. Well you  today  universalize your principles. You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them. If you have a principle such as  people shouldn't suffer unless they're guilty of something  then to exclude black people you've got to make exceptions  don't you  You have to say  well  blackness of skin  you couldn't suffer just for that. It must be that blacks are somehow tainted. And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear  can't we  and say  well how can you consider all blacks tainted when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black. And you can get moral argument off the ground  then  because you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities. You're treating them as universals  to be rendered consistent by logic. Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests  That's what initially got me going on cognitive history. If you look at the I.Q. test  you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas. The similarities subtest of the Wechsler is about classification  and we have made enormous gains on that classification subtest. There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery that are about using logic on abstractions. Some of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices  and it's all about analogies. And in       people could do simple analogies. That is  if you said to them  cats are like wildcats. What are dogs like  They would say wolves. But by       people could attack Raven's on a much more sophisticated level. If you said  we've got two squares followed by a triangle  what follows two circles  They could say a semicircle. Just as a triangle is half of a square  a semicircle is half of a circle. By       college graduates  if you said two circles followed by a semicircle  two sixteens followed by what  they would say eight  because eight is half of   . That is  they had moved so far from the concrete world that they could even ignore the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question. Now  I should say one thing that's very disheartening. We haven't made progress on all fronts. One of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through politics  and sadly you can have humane moral principles  you can classify  you can use logic on abstractions  and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries  you can't do politics. We've noticed  in a trend among young Americans  that they read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands  and they're essentially ahistorical. They live in the bubble of the present. They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam. They don't know who was an ally of America in World War II. Think how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fifth time Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order  and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions. And that is  they had barely left  and there wasn't a trace in the sand. Or imagine how different things would be if most Americans knew that we had been lied into four of our last six wars. You know  the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine  the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions  the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet  and  of course  Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda and had nothing to do with it  and yet the administration convinced    percent of the people that they were brothers in arms  when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost. But I don't want to end on a pessimistic note. The   th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves in ordinary people that we have now realized  and the aristocracy was convinced that the average person couldn't make it  that they could never share their mindset or their cognitive abilities. Lord Curzon once said he saw people bathing in the North Sea  and he said   Why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have   As if they were a reptile. Well  Dickens was right and he was wrong.  Correction  Rudyard Kipling   Kipling  said   The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters underneath the skin.  For a long time in my life  I felt like I'd been living two different lives. There's the life that everyone sees  and then there's the life that only I see. And in the life that everyone sees  who I am is a friend  a son  a brother  a stand up comedian and a teenager. That's the life everyone sees. If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me  that's what they would tell you. And that's a huge part of me. That is who I am. And if you were to ask me to describe myself  I'd probably say some of those same things. And I wouldn't be lying  but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth  either  because the truth is  that's just the life everyone else sees. In the life that only I see  who I am  who I really am  is someone who struggles intensely with depression. I have for the last six years of my life  and I continue to every day. Now  for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn't really know what that means  that might surprise them to hear  because there's this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong  when you break up with your girlfriend  when you lose a loved one  when you don't get the job you wanted. But that's sadness. That's a natural thing. That's a natural human emotion. Real depression isn't being sad when something in your life goes wrong. Real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right. That's real depression  and that's what I suffer from. And to be totally honest  that's hard for me to stand up here and say. It's hard for me to talk about  and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about  so much so that no one's talking about it. And no one's talking about depression  but we need to be  because right now it's a massive problem. It's a massive problem. But we don't see it on social media  right  We don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter. We don't see it on the news  because it's not happy  it's not fun  it's not light. And so because we don't see it  we don't see the severity of it. But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this  every    seconds  every    seconds  somewhere  someone in the world takes their own life because of depression  and it might be two blocks away  it might be two countries away  it might be two continents away  but it's happening  and it's happening every single day. And we have a tendency  as a society  to look at that and go   So what   So what  We look at that  and we go   That's your problem. That's their problem.  We say we're sad and we say we're sorry  but we also say   So what   Well  two years ago it was my problem  because I sat on the edge of my bed where I'd sat a million times before and I was suicidal. I was suicidal  and if you were to look at my life on the surface  you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal. You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team  the drama and theater student of the year  the English student of the year  someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party. So you would say I wasn't depressed  you would say I wasn't suicidal  but you would be wrong. You would be wrong. So I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and I thought about taking my own life and I came this close to doing it. I came this close to doing it. And I didn't  so that makes me one of the lucky ones  one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump  one of the lucky ones who survives. Well  I survived  and that just leaves me with my story  and my story is this  In four simple words  I suffer from depression. I suffer from depression  and for a long time  I think  I was living two totally different lives  where one person was always afraid of the other. I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was  that I wasn't the perfect  popular kid in high school everyone thought I was  that beneath my smile  there was struggle  and beneath my light  there was dark  and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain. See  some people might fear girls not liking them back. Some people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death. But for me  for a large part of my life  I feared myself. I feared my truth  I feared my honesty  I feared my vulnerability  and that fear made me feel like I was forced into a corner  like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out  and so I thought about that way every single day. I thought about it every single day  and if I'm being totally honest  standing here I've thought about it again since  because that's the sickness  that's the struggle  that's depression  and depression isn't chicken pox. You don't beat it once and it's gone forever. It's something you live with. It's something you live in. It's the roommate you can't kick out. It's the voice you can't ignore. It's the feelings you can't seem to escape  the scariest part is that after a while  you become numb to it. It becomes normal for you  and what you really fear the most isn't the suffering inside of you. It's the stigma inside of others  it's the shame  it's the embarrassment  it's the disapproving look on a friend's face  it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak  it's the comments that you're crazy. That's what keeps you from getting help. That's what makes you hold it in and hide it. It's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it  and you hold it in and you hide it  and even though it's keeping you in bed every day and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it  you hide it  because the stigma in our society around depression is very real. It's very real  and if you think that it isn't  ask yourself this  Would you rather make your next Facebook status say you're having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you're depressed  That's the stigma  because unfortunately  we live in a world where if you break your arm  everyone runs over to sign your cast  but if you tell people you're depressed  everyone runs the other way. That's the stigma. We are so  so  so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains. And that's ignorance. That's pure ignorance  and that ignorance has created a world that doesn't understand depression  that doesn't understand mental health. And that's ironic to me  because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world  yet it's one of the least discussed. We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself. Well  it won't. It hasn't  and it's not going to  because that's wishful thinking  and wishful thinking isn't a game plan  it's procrastination  and we can't procrastinate on something this important. The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. Well  we haven't done that  so we can't really expect to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question. And I don't know what the solution is. I wish I did  but I don't    but I think  I think it has to start here. It has to start with me  it has to start with you  it has to start with the people who are suffering  the ones who are hidden in the shadows. We need to speak up and shatter the silence. We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in  because if there's one thing that I've come to realize  if there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem  it's not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others. It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves  where we're okay with who we are  because when we get honest  we see that we all struggle and we all suffer. Whether it's with this  whether it's with something else  we all know what it is to hurt. We all know what it is to have pain in our heart  and we all know how important it is to heal. But right now  depression is society's deep cut that we're content to put a Band Aid over and pretend it's not there. Well  it is there. It is there  and you know what  It's okay. Depression is okay. If you're going through it  know that you're okay. And know that you're sick  you're not weak  and it's an issue  not an identity  because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others  you can see depression for what it really is  and that's just a part of life  just a part of life  and as much as I hate  as much as I hate some of the places  some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to  in a lot of ways I'm grateful for it. Because yeah  it's put me in the valleys  but only to show me there's peaks  and yeah it's dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light. My pain  more than anything in    years on this planet  has given me perspective  and my hurt  my hurt has forced me to have hope  have hope and to have faith  faith in myself  faith in others  faith that it can get better  that we can change this  that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance  fight back against intolerance  and more than anything  learn to love ourselves  learn to accept ourselves for who we are  the people we are  not the people the world wants us to be. Because the world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark. The world I believe in is one where we're measured by our ability to overcome adversities  not avoid them. The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say   I'm going through hell   and they can look back at me and go   Me too   and that's okay  and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people. We're people  and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry  and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness  then I'm here to tell you you're wrong. You're wrong  because it's the opposite. We're people  and we have problems. We're not perfect  and that's okay. So we need to stop the ignorance  stop the intolerance  stop the stigma  and stop the silence  and we need to take away the taboos  take a look at the truth  and start talking  because the only way we're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together  by standing strong together. And I believe that we can. I believe that we can. Thank you guys so much. This is a dream come true. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  So I wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book  and it's a story of something that happened       years ago  when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy. And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel. And the reason the story obsessed me is that I thought I understood it  and then I went back over it and I realized that I didn't understand it at all. Ancient Palestine had a    along its eastern border  there's a mountain range. Still same is true of Israel today. And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region  so Jerusalem  Bethlehem  Hebron. And then there's a coastal plain along the Mediterranean  where Tel Aviv is now. And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the Shephelah  which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west  and you can follow the Shephelah  go through the Shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains. And the Shephelah  if you've been to Israel  you'll know it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel. It's gorgeous  with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards. But more importantly  though  in the history of that region  it's served  it's had a real strategic function  and that is  it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way  get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains. And       years ago  that's exactly what happens. The Philistines  who are the biggest of enemies of the Kingdom of Israel  are living in the coastal plain. They're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people. And they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the Shephelah up into the mountains  because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two. And the Kingdom of Israel  which is headed by King Saul  obviously catches wind of this  and Saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah  one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah. And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge  and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge  and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other  because they're deadlocked. Neither can attack the other  because to attack the other side you've got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side  and you're completely exposed. So finally  to break the deadlock  the Philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor  and he calls out and he says to the Israelites   Send your mightiest warrior down  and we'll have this out  just the two of us.  This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat. It was a way of settling disputes without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle. And the Philistine who is sent down  their mighty warrior  is a giant. He's   foot  . He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor  and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin and he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying. And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him. It's a death wish  right  There's no way they think they can take him. And finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy  and he goes up to Saul and he says   I'll fight him.  And Saul says   You can't fight him. That's ridiculous. You're this kid. This is this mighty warrior.  But the shepherd is adamant. He says   No  no  no  you don't understand  I have been defending my flock against lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it.  And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward. So he says   All right.  And then he turns to the kid  and he says   But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are.  So he tries to give the shepherd his armor  and the shepherd says   No.  He says   I can't wear this stuff.  The Biblical verse is   I cannot wear this for I have not proved it   meaning   I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy.  So he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd's bag and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant. And the giant sees this figure approaching  and calls out   Come to me so I can feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field.  He issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him. And the shepherd draws closer and closer  and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff. That's all he's carrying. Instead of a weapon  just this shepherd's staff  and he says    he's insulted     Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks   And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket  puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes    right here  in his most vulnerable spot    and he falls down either dead or unconscious  and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head  and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run. And of course  the name of the giant is Goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is David  and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything I thought I knew about that story turned out to be wrong. So David  in that story  is supposed to be the underdog  right  In fact  that term  David and Goliath  has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger. Now why do we call David an underdog  Well  we call him an underdog because he's a kid  a little kid  and Goliath is this big  strong giant. We also call him an underdog because Goliath is an experienced warrior  and David is just a shepherd. But most importantly  we call him an underdog because all he has is    it's that Goliath is outfitted with all of this modern weaponry  this glittering coat of armor and a sword and a javelin and a spear  and all David has is this sling. Well  let's start there with the phrase  All David has is this sling   because that's the first mistake that we make. In ancient warfare  there are three kinds of warriors. There's cavalry  men on horseback and with chariots. There's heavy infantry  which are foot soldiers  armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor. And there's artillery  and artillery are archers  but  more importantly  slingers. And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it  and they put a projectile  either a rock or a lead ball  inside the pouch  and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go  and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target. That's what David has  and it's important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot. It's not this  right  It's not a child's toy. It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon. When David rolls it around like this  he's turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second  and that means that when the rock is released  it's going forward really fast  probably    meters per second. That's substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers. More than that  the stones in the Valley of Elah were not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate  which are rocks twice the density of normal stones. If you do the calculations on the ballistics  on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling  it's roughly equal to the stopping power of a  .   caliber  handgun. This is an incredibly devastating weapon. Accuracy  we know from historical records that slingers    experienced slingers could hit and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to     yards. From medieval tapestries  we know that slingers were capable of hitting birds in flight. They were incredibly accurate. When David lines up    and he's not     yards away from Goliath  he's quite close to Goliath    when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath  he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes. If you go back over the history of ancient warfare  you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another. So what's Goliath  He's heavy infantry  and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman. When he says   Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field   the key phrase is  Come to me.  Come up to me because we're going to fight  hand to hand  like this. Saul has the same expectation. David says   I want to fight Goliath   and Saul tries to give him his armor  because Saul is thinking   Oh  when you say 'fight Goliath ' you mean 'fight him in hand to hand combat ' infantry on infantry.  But David has absolutely no expectation. He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he  He's a shepherd. He's spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves. That's where his strength lies. So here he is  this shepherd  experienced in the use of a devastating weapon  up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short range combat. Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance. So why do we keep calling David an underdog  and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable  There's a second piece of this that's important. It's not just that we misunderstand David and his choice of weaponry. It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath. Goliath is not what he seems to be. There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text  things that are in retrospect quite puzzling and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior. So to begin with  the Bible says that Goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant. Now that is weird  right  Here is this mighty warrior challenging the Israelites to one on one combat. Why is he being led by the hand by some young boy  presumably  to the point of combat  Secondly  the Bible story makes special note of how slowly Goliath moves  another odd thing to say when you're describing the mightiest warrior known to man at that point. And then there's this whole weird thing about how long it takes Goliath to react to the sight of David. So David's coming down the mountain  and he's clearly not preparing for hand to hand combat. There is nothing about him that says   I am about to fight you like this.  He's not even carrying a sword. Why does Goliath not react to that  It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day. And then there's that strange comment he makes to David   Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks   Sticks  David only has one stick. Well  it turns out that there's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with Goliath  an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies. There have been many articles written. The first one was in      in the Indiana Medical Journal  and it started a chain of speculation that starts with an explanation for Goliath's height. So Goliath is head and shoulders above all of his peers in that era  and usually when someone is that far out of the norm  there's an explanation for it. So the most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly  and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone. And throughout history  many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly. So the tallest person of all time was a guy named Robert Wadlow who was still growing when he died at the age of    and he was   foot   . He had acromegaly. Do you remember the wrestler Andr  the Giant  Famous. He had acromegaly. There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly. Anyone who's unusually tall  that's the first explanation we come up with. And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it  principally having to do with vision. The pituitary tumor  as it grows  often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain  with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted. So when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with Goliath  they've said   Wait a minute  he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly.  And that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day. Why does he move so slowly and have to be escorted down into the valley floor by an attendant  Because he can't make his way on his own. Why is he so strangely oblivious to David that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him until the very last moment  Because he can't see him. When he says   Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field   the phrase  come to me  is a hint also of his vulnerability. Come to me because I can't see you. And then there's   Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks   He sees two sticks when David has only one. So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe. What they didn't understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness. And there is  I think  in that  a very important lesson for all of us. Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem. And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket. Thank you. I think it's safe to say that all humans will be intimate with death at least once in their lives. But what if that intimacy began long before you faced your own transition from life into death  What would life be like if the dead literally lived alongside you  In my husband's homeland in the highlands of Sulawesi island in eastern Indonesia  there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event but as a gradual social process. In Tana Toraja  the most important social moments in people's lives  the focal points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners  but funerals. So these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals    pigs  chickens and  most importantly  water buffalo    that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased. So this cultural complex surrounding death  the ritual enactment of the end of life  has made death the most visible and remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape. Lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks  funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair  where commemorating someone who's died is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition. And it's a transition that's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead. So every year  thousands of visitors come to Tana Toraja to see  as it were  this culture of death  and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies are somehow incommensurable with the way that we face our own mortality in the West. So even as we share death as a universal experience  it's not experienced the same way the world over. And as an anthropologist  I see these differences in experience being rooted in the cultural and social world through which we define the phenomena around us. So where we see an unquestionable reality  death as an irrefutable biological condition  Torajans see the expired corporeal form as part of a larger social genesis. So again  the physical cessation of life is not the same as death. In fact  a member of society is only truly dead when the extended family can agree upon and marshal the resources necessary to hold a funeral ceremony that is considered appropriate in terms of resources for the status of the deceased. And this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone's participation. So after a person's physical death  their body is placed in a special room in the traditional residence  which is called the tongkonan. And the tongkonan is symbolic not only of the family's identity but also of the human life cycle from birth to death. So essentially  the shape of the building that you're born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place. Until the funeral ceremony  which can be held years after a person's physical death  the deceased is referred to as  to makala   a sick person  or  to mama   a person who is asleep  and they continue to be a member of the household. They are symbolically fed and cared for  and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions  which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life into the afterlife known as Puya. So I know what some of you must be thinking right now. Is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead relatives  And that's exactly what I'm saying. But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies  proximity to death  or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death  I like to think about what the Torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out. I think that Torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death  and that is that our relationships with other humans  their impact on our social reality  doesn't cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body  that there's a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed but not ended. So Torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship by lavishing love and attention on the most visible symbol of that relationship  the human body. So my husband has fond memories of talking to and playing with and generally being around his deceased grandfather  and for him there is nothing unnatural about this. This is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their relationship to the deceased  and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who's living to relating to the deceased as a person who's an ancestor. And here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors  so these are people who have already been buried  already had a funeral ceremony. These are called tau tau. So the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death. It ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities. And it's also a moment of self awareness. It's a moment when people think about who they are  their place in society  and their role in the life cycle in accordance with Torajan cosmology. There's a saying in Toraja that all people will become grandparents  and what this means is that after death  we all become part of the ancestral line that anchors us between the past and the present and will define who our loved ones are into the future. So essentially  we all become grandparents to the generations of human children that come after us. And this metaphor of membership in the greater human family is the way that children also describe the money that they invest in these sacrificial buffaloes that are thought to carry people's soul from here to the afterlife  and children will explain that they will invest the money in this because they want to repay their parents the debt for all of the years their parents spent investing and caring for them. But the sacrifice of buffalo and the ritual display of wealth also exhibits the status of the deceased  and  by extension  the deceased's family. So at funerals  relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about death in this place  its impact on life and the relationships of the living. So all of this focus on death doesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire to the ideal of a long life. They engage in many practices thought to confer good health and survival to an advanced age. But they don't put much stock in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness or in old age. It's said in Toraja that everybody has sort of a predetermined amount of life. It's called the sunga'. And like a thread  it should be allowed to unspool to its natural end. So by having death as a part of the cultural and social fabric of life  people's everyday decisions about their health and healthcare are affected. The patriarch of my husband's maternal clan  Nenet Katcha  is now approaching the age of      as far as we can tell. And there are increasing signs that he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya. And his death will be greatly mourned. But I know that my husband's family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives  when they can ritually recount his life's narrative  weaving his story into the history of their community. His story is their story. His funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves. And it's a story that has no discernible beginning  no foreseeable end. It's a story that goes on long after his body no longer does. People ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed by participating in a culture where the physical manifestations of death greet us at every turn. But I see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one. In reality  the relationship between the living and the dead has its own drama in the U.S. healthcare system  where decisions about how long to stretch the thread of life are made based on our emotional and social ties with the people around us  not just on medicine's ability to prolong life. We  like the Torajans  base our decisions about life on the meanings and the definitions that we ascribe to death. So I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the Torajans. It might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the United States. But I want to ask what we can gain from seeing physical death not only as a biological process but as part of the greater human story. What would it be like to look on the expired human form with love because it's so intimately a part of who we all are  If we could expand our definition of death to encompass life  we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear. Perhaps one of the answers to the challenges that are facing the U.S. healthcare system  particularly in the end of life care  is as simple as a shift in perspective  and the shift in perspective in this case would be to look at the social life of every death. It might help us recognize that the way we limit our conversation about death to something that's medical or biological is reflective of a larger culture that we all share of avoiding death  being afraid of talking about it. If we could entertain and value other kinds of knowledge about life  including other definitions of death  it has the potential to change the discussions that we have about the end of life. It could change the way that we die  but more importantly  it could transform the way that we live. So my name is Amy Webb  and a few years ago I found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion. And I thought  what's wrong with me  I don't understand why this keeps happening. So I asked everybody in my life what they thought. I turned to my grandmother  who always had plenty of advice  and she said   Stop being so picky. You've got to date around. And most importantly  true love will find you when you least expect it.  Now as it turns out  I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data  as you'll soon find. I am constantly swimming in numbers  formulas and charts. I also have a very tight knit family  and I'm very  very close with my sister  and as a result  I wanted to have the same type of family when I grew up. So I'm at the end of this bad breakup  I'm    years old  I figure I'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months before I'm ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of cohabitate  and we have to do that for a while before we can get engaged. And if I want to start having children by the time I'm     that meant that I would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago. So that wasn't going to work. If my strategy was to least expect my way into true love  then the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity. In short  I was trying to figure out what's the probability of my finding Mr. Right  Well  at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia  and it's a big city  and I figured  in this entire place  there are lots of possibilities. So again  I started doing some math. Population of Philadelphia  it has  .  million people. I figure about half of that are men  so that takes the number down to        . I'm looking for a guy between the ages of    and     which was only four percent of the population  so now I'm dealing with the possibility of        men. I was looking for somebody who was Jewish  because I am and that was important to me. That's only  .  percent of the population. I figure I'm attracted to maybe one out of    of those men  and there was no way I was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer. So that basically meant there were    men for me that I could possibly date in the entire city of Philadelphia. In the meantime  my very large Jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children  and I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already. So I have two possible strategies at this point I'm sort of figuring out. One  I can take my grandmother's advice and sort of least expect my way into maybe bumping into the one out of    possible men in the entire  .  million person city of Philadelphia  or I could try online dating. Now  I like the idea of online dating  because it's predicated on an algorithm  and that's really just a simple way of saying I've got a problem  I'm going to use some data  run it through a system and get to a solution. So online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other  but as it turns out  algorithms have been around for thousands of years in almost every culture. In fact  in Judaism  there were matchmakers a long time ago  and though they didn't have an explicit algorithm per se  they definitely were running through formulas in their heads  like  is the girl going to like the boy  Are the families going to get along  What's the rabbi going to say  Are they going to start having children right away  The matchmaker would sort of think through all of this  put two people together  and that would be the end of it. So in my case  I thought  well  will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming  So I decided to sign on. Now  there was one small catch. As I'm signing on to the various dating websites  as it happens  I was really  really busy. But that actually wasn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that I hate filling out questionnaires of any kind  and I certainly don't like questionnaires that are like Cosmo quizzes. So I just copied and pasted from my r sum . So in the descriptive part up top  I said that I was an award winning journalist and a future thinker. When I was asked about fun activities and my ideal date  I said monetization and fluency in Japanese. I talked a lot about JavaScript. So obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward. But the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date. These algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates    what turned out to be truly awful dates. There was this guy Steve  the I.T. guy. The algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets  we share a love of math and data and '  s music  and so I agreed to go out with him. So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out to one of Philadelphia's white table cloth  extremely expensive restaurants. And we went in  and right off the bat  our conversation really wasn't taking flight  but he was ordering a lot of food. In fact  he didn't even bother looking at the menu. He was ordering multiple appetizers  multiple entr es  for me as well  and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table  also lots and lots of bottles of wine. So we're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner  and I've decided Steve the I.T. guy and I are really just not meant for each other  but we'll part ways as friends  when he gets up to go to the bathroom  and in the meantime  the bill comes to our table. And listen  I'm a modern woman. I am totally down with splitting the bill. But then Steve the I.T. guy didn't come back. And that was my entire month's rent. So needless to say  I was not having a good night. So I run home  I call my mother  I call my sister  and as I do  at the end of each one of these terrible  terrible dates  I regale them with the details. And they say to me   Stop complaining.   You're just being too picky.  So I said  fine  from here on out I'm only going on dates where I know there's Wi Fi  and I'm bringing my laptop. I'm going to shove it into my bag  I'm going to have this email template  and I'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically  these dates really are terrible. So I started tracking things like really stupid  awkward  sexual remarks  bad vocabulary  the number of times a man forced me to high five him. So I started to crunch some numbers  and that allowed me to make some correlations. So as it turns out  for some reason  men who drink Scotch reference kinky sex immediately. Well  it turns out that these probably weren't bad guys. There were just bad for me. And as it happens  the algorithms that were setting us up  they weren't bad either. These algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do  which was to take our user generated information  in my case  my r sum   and match it up with other people's information. See  the real problem here is that  while the algorithms work just fine  you and I don't  when confronted with blank windows where we're supposed to input our information online. Very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves. The other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like  are you a dog person or a cat person  Do you like horror films or romance films  I'm not looking for a pen pal. I'm looking for a husband. Right  So there's a certain amount of superficiality in that data. So I said fine  I've got a new plan. I'm going to keep using these online dating sites  but I'm going to treat them as databases  and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up  I think I'm going to try reverse engineering this entire system. So knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people  I decided instead to ask my own questions. What was every single possible thing that I could think of that I was looking for in a mate  So I started writing and writing and writing  and at the end  I had amassed    different data points. I wanted somebody was Jew ish  so I was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture  but wasn't going to force me to go to shul every Friday and Saturday. I wanted somebody who worked hard  because work for me is extremely important  but not too hard. For me  the hobbies that I have are really just new work projects that I've launched. I also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children  but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do  so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three  and also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it. So things like that  but I also wanted somebody who would go to far flung  exotic places  like Petra  Jordan. I also wanted somebody who would weigh    pounds more than me at all times  regardless of what I weighed. So I now have these    different data points  which  to be fair  is a lot. So what I did was  I went through and I prioritized that list. I broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points  and I ranked everything starting at     and going all the way down to     and listing things like I was looking for somebody who was really smart  who would challenge and stimulate me  and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points. These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal breakers. So once I had all this done  I then built a scoring system  because what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not I thought the guy that I found online would be a match with me. I figured there would be a minimum of     points before I would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message. For     points  I'd agree to go out on a date  and I wouldn't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the       point threshold. Well  as it turns out  this worked pretty well. So I go back online now. I found Jewishdoc   who's incredibly good looking  incredibly well spoken  he had hiked Mt. Fuji  he had walked along the Great Wall. He likes to travel as long as it doesn't involve a cruise ship. And I thought  I've done it  I've cracked the code. I have just found the Jewish Prince Charming of my family's dreams. There was only one problem  He didn't like me back. And I guess the one variable that I haven't considered is the competition. Who are all of the other women on these dating sites  I found SmileyGirl    . She said she was a  Fun girl who is Happy and Outgoing.  She listed her job as  teacher.  She said she is  silly  nice and friendly.  She likes to make people laugh  alot.  At this moment I knew  clicking profile after profile that looked like this  that I needed to do some market research. So I created    fake male profiles. Now  before I lose all of you    understand that I did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system. I didn't carry on crazy Catfish style relationships with anybody. I really was just scraping their data. But I didn't want everybody's data. I only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that I really  really wanted to marry. When I released these men into the wild  I did follow some rules. So I didn't reach out to any woman first. I just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract  and mainly what I was looking at was two different data sets. So I was looking at qualitative data  so what was the humor  the tone  the voice  the communication style that these women shared in common  And also quantitative data  so what was the average length of their profile  how much time was spent between messages  What I was trying to get at here was that I figured  in person  I would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl    . I wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online. Well  one month later  I had a lot of data  and I was able to do another analysis. And as it turns out  content matters a lot. So smart people tend to write a lot                        words about themselves  which may all be very  very interesting. The challenge here  though  is that the popular men and women are sticking to    words on average that are written very  very well  even though it may not seem like it all the time. The other hallmark of the people who do this well is that they're using non specific language. So in my case   The English Patient  is my most favorite movie ever  but it doesn't work to use that in a profile  because that's a superficial data point  and somebody may disagree and decide they don't want to go out because they didn't like sitting through the three hour movie. Also  optimistic language matters a lot. So this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women  words like  fun  and  girl  and  love.  And what I realized was not that I had to dumb down my own profile. Remember  I'm somebody who said that I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript and I was okay with that. The difference is that it's about being more approachable and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you. And as it turns out  timing is also really  really important. Just because you have access to somebody's mobile phone number or their instant message account and it's   o'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake  doesn't mean that that's a good time to communicate with those people. The popular women on these online sites spend an average of    hours in between each communication. And that's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship. And finally    there were the photos. All of the women who were popular showed some skin. They all looked really great  which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what I had uploaded. Once I had all of this information  I was able to create a super profile  so it was still me  but it was me optimized now for this ecosystem. And as it turns out  I did a really good job. I was the most popular person online. And as it turns out  lots and lots of men wanted to date me. So I call my mom  I call my sister  I call my grandmother. I'm telling them about this fabulous news  and they say   This is wonderful  How soon are you going out   I said   Actually  I'm not going to go out with anybody.  Because remember  in my scoring system  they have to reach a minimum threshold of     points  and none of them have done that. They said   What  You're still being too damn picky.  Well  not too long after that  I found this guy  Thevenin  and he said that he was culturally Jewish  he said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter  which I thought was very clever. He talked in detail about travel. He made a lot of really interesting cultural references. He looked and talked exactly like what I wanted  and immediately  he scored     points. It was enough for a date. Three weeks later  we met up in person for what turned out to be a    hour long conversation that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant  and when he dropped me back off at my house that night I re scored him           points   Thought  you know what  this entire time  I haven't been picky enough. Well  a year and a half after that  we were non cruise ship traveling through Petra  Jordan  when he got down on his knee and proposed. A year after that  we were married  and about a year and a half after that  our daughter  Petra  was born. Audience  Oh   What it means...  Obviously  I'm having a fabulous life  so    The question is  what does all of this mean for you  Well  as it turns out  there is an algorithm for love. It's just not the ones that we're being presented with online. In fact  it's something that you write yourself. So whether you're looking for a husband or a wife or you're trying to find your passion or you're trying to start a business  all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules  and feel free to be as picky as you want. Well  on my wedding day  I had a conversation again with my grandmother  and she said   All right  maybe I was wrong. It looks like you did come up with a really  really great system. Now  your matzah balls ... They should be fluffy  not hard.  And I'll take her advice on that. An image is worth more than a thousand words  so I'm going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that I recently captured. So by now  my talk is already       words long  and I feel like I should stop here. At the same time  I probably owe you some explanation about the images that you just saw. What I am trying to do as a photographer  as an artist  is to bring the world of art and science together. Whether it is an image of a soap bubble captured at the very moment where it's bursting  as you can see in this image  whether it's a universe made of tiny little beads of oil paint  strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways  or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces  I'm always trying to link those two fields together. What I find very intriguing about those two is that they both look at the same thing  They are a response to their surroundings. And yet  they do it in a very different way. If you look at science on one hand  science is a very rational approach to its surroundings  whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings. What I am trying to do is I'm trying to bring those two views into one so that my images both speak to the viewer's heart but also to the viewer's brain. Let me demonstrate this based on three projects. The first one has to do with making sound visible. Now as you may know  sound travels in waves  so if you have a speaker  a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal  transform it into a vibration  which is then transported through the air  is captured by our ear  and transformed into an audio signal again. Now I was thinking  how can I make those sound waves visible  So I came up with the following setup. I took a speaker  I placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker  and then I added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker. And now  if I would play a sound through that speaker  it would cause the crystals to move up and down. Now this happens very fast  in the blink of an eye  so  together with LG  we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than       frames per second. Let me show you what this looks like. Thank you very much. I agree  it looks pretty amazing. But I have to tell you a funny story. I got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in Los Angeles. Now in Los Angeles  you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches  but I got mine indoors  and what happened is that  if you're shooting at       frames per second  you need to have a silly amount of light  lots of lights. So we had this speaker set up  and we had the camera facing it  and lots of lights pointing at the speaker  and I would set up the speaker  put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker  and we would do this over and over again  and it was until midday that I realized that I had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker. What was so funny about it was that the speaker was only coming from the right side  so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera for the rest of the week. Let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances. Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid  Ah  some of you have. Excellent. Should I skip that part  Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior. It's a liquid that is completely black. It's got an oily consistency. And it's got tiny little particles of metal in it  which makes it magnetic. So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field  it would change its appearance. Now I've got a live demonstration over here to show this to you. So I've got a camera pointing down at this plate  and underneath that plate  there is a magnet. Now I'm going to add some of that ferrofluid to that magnet. Let's just slightly move it to the right and maybe focus it a little bit more. Excellent. So what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes. This is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles inside the liquid. Now this looks already quite interesting  but let me now add some watercolors to it. Those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with. You wouldn't paint with syringes  but it works just the same. So what happened now is  when the watercolor was flowing into the structure  the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid. That's because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic. That means it doesn't mix with the water. And at the same time  it tries to maintain its position above the magnet  and therefore  it creates those amazing looking structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint. So that was the second project. Let me now turn to the last project  which involves the national beverage of Scotland. This image  and also this one  were made using whiskey. Now you might ask yourself  how did he do that  Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper  I can assure you I was fully conscious while I was taking those pictures. Now  whiskey contains    percent of alcohol  and alcohol has got some very interesting properties. Maybe you have experienced some of those properties before  but I am talking about the physical properties  not the other ones. So when I open the bottle  the alcohol molecules would spread in the air  and that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance. And at the same time  alcohol is highly flammable. And it was with those two properties that I was able to create the images that you're seeing right now. Let me demonstrate this over here. And what I have here is an empty glass vessel. It's got nothing in it. And now I'm going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey. Add some more. Now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle. And now  let's set that on fire. So that's all that happens. It goes really fast  and it's not that impressive. I could do it again to show it one more time  but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey  and that I should rather drink it. But let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what I just showed you in this live demonstration. So what happened is that the flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom  burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol. So the images that you saw at the beginning  they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle  and you have to imagine it was flipped around     degrees. So that's how those images were made. Thank you. So  I have now showed you three projects  and you might ask yourself  what is it good for  What's the idea behind it  Is it just a waste of whiskey  Is it just some strange materials  Those three projects  they're based on very simple scientific phenomena  such as magnetism  the sound waves  or over here  the physical properties of a substance  and what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way  and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us. Thank you very much. So  we used to solve big problems. On July   st        Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo   's lunar module and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong and Aldrin were alone  but their presence on the moon's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive  collective effort. The Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the United States. To get to the moon  NASA spent around     billion dollars in today's money  or four percent of the federal budget. Apollo employed around         people and demanded the collaboration of        companies  universities and government agencies. People died  including the crew of Apollo  . But before the Apollo program ended     men flew to the moon. Twelve walked on its surface  of whom Aldrin  following the death of Armstrong last year  is now the most senior. So why did they go  They didn't bring much back      pounds of old rocks  and something all    later emphasized    a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home. Why did they go  The cynical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets. But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in      provide a better clue. Why choose this as our goal  And they may well ask  why climb the highest mountain  Why     years ago  fly the Atlantic  Why does Rice play Texas  We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade  and do the other things  not because they are easy  but because they are hard. Jason Pontin  To contemporaries  Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East in the Cold War. At the time  the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology. They went because it was a big thing to do. Landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs. The first half of the   th century produced the assembly line and the airplane  penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis. In the middle years of the century  polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated. Technology itself seemed to possess what Alvin Toffler in      called  accelerative thrust.  For most of human history  we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail  but in       the crew of Apollo    flew at        miles an hour. Since       no human beings have been back to the moon. No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo     and blithe optimism about technology's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve  such as going to Mars  creating clean energy  curing cancer  or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard. I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo   . I was five years old  and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket. I vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions  but I was absolutely certain there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime. So  Something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology  has become a commonplace. You hear it all the time. We've heard it over the last two days here at TED. It feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys  with things like iPhones and apps and social media  or algorithms that speed automated trading. There's nothing wrong with most of these things. They've expanded and enriched our lives. But they don't solve humanity's big problems. What happened  So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley  which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed Intel  Microsoft  Apple and Genentech. Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame  in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs. Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems. But I don't think that explanation is good enough. It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley. Even when venture capitalists were at their most risk happy  they preferred small investments  tiny investments that offered an exit within    years. V.C.s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy  and V.C.s have never  never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value. No  the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound. Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems. We could go to Mars if we want. NASA even has the outline of a plan. But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal  and that will never happen. We won't go to Mars  because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth. Sometimes  we can't solve big problems because our political systems fail. Today  less than two percent of the world's energy consumption derives from advanced  renewable sources such as solar  wind and biofuels  less than two percent  and the reason is purely economic. Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind  and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels. We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price. None exist. Now  technologists  business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur the development of alternative energy  mostly  a significant increase in energy research and development  and some kind of price on carbon. But there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus. Sometimes  big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so. Famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply. But    years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution. Technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food  but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments. Finally  big problems sometimes elude solution because we don't really understand the problem. President Nixon declared war on cancer in       but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer  most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy  and it is only in the last    years that effective  viable therapies have come to seem real. Hard problems are hard. It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology. We can  we must  but these four elements must all be present  Political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem  institutions must support its solution  It must really be a technological problem  and we must understand it. The Apollo mission  which has become a kind of metaphor for technology's capacity to solve big problems  met these criteria. But it is an irreproducible model for the future. It is not     . There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War  no politician like John Kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous  and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system. Most of all  going to the moon turned out to be easy. It was just three days away. And arguably it wasn't even solving much of a problem. We are left alone with our day  and the solutions of the future will be harder won. God knows  we don't lack for the challenges. Thank you very much. I think we're all aware that the world today is full of problems. We've been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades. Serious problems  big problems  pressing problems. Poor nutrition  access to water  climate change  deforestation  lack of skills  insecurity  not enough food  not enough healthcare  pollution. There's problem after problem  and I think what really separates this time from any time I can remember in my brief time on Earth is the awareness of these problems. We're all very aware. Why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems  That's the question I've been struggling with  coming from my very different perspective. I'm not a social problem guy. I'm a guy that works with business  helps business make money. God forbid. So why are we having so many problems with these social problems  and really is there any role for business  and if so  what is that role  I think that in order to address that question  we have to step back and think about how we've understood and pondered both the problems and the solutions to these great social challenges that we face. Now  I think many have seen business as the problem  or at least one of the problems  in many of the social challenges we face. You know  think of the fast food industry  the drug industry  the banking industry. You know  this is a low point in the respect for business. Business is not seen as the solution. It's seen as the problem now  for most people. And rightly so  in many cases. There's a lot of bad actors out there that have done the wrong thing  that actually have made the problem worse. So this perspective is perhaps justified. How have we tended to see the solutions to these social problems  these many issues that we face in society  Well  we've tended to see the solutions in terms of NGOs  in terms of government  in terms of philanthropy. Indeed  the kind of unique organizational entity of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs and social organizations. This is a unique  new organizational form that we've seen grown up. Enormous innovation  enormous energy  enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure to try to deal with all of these challenges. And many of us here are deeply involved in that. I'm a business school professor  but I've actually founded  I think  now  four nonprofits. Whenever I got interested and became aware of a societal problem  that was what I did  form a nonprofit. That was the way we've thought about how to deal with these issues. Even a business school professor has thought about it that way. But I think at this moment  we've been at this for quite a while. We've been aware of these problems for decades. We have decades of experience with our NGOs and with our government entities  and there's an awkward reality. The awkward reality is we're not making fast enough progress. We're not winning. These problems still seem very daunting and very intractable  and any solutions we're achieving are small solutions. We're making incremental progress. What's the fundamental problem we have in dealing with these social problems  If we cut all the complexity away  we have the problem of scale. We can't scale. We can make progress. We can show benefits. We can show results. We can make things better. We're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good. We can't scale. We can't make a large scale impact on these problems. Why is that  Because we don't have the resources. And that's really clear now. And that's clearer now than it's been for decades. There's simply not enough money to deal with any of these problems at scale using the current model. There's not enough tax revenue  there's not enough philanthropic donations  to deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now. We've got to confront that reality. And the scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing  certainly in the advanced world today  with all the fiscal problems we face. So if it's fundamentally a resource problem  where are the resources in society  How are those resources really created  the resources we're going to need to deal with all these societal challenges  Well there  I think the answer is very clear  They're in business. All wealth is actually created by business. Business creates wealth when it meets needs at a profit. That's how all wealth is created. It's meeting needs at a profit that leads to taxes and that leads to incomes and that leads to charitable donations. That's where all the resources come from. Only business can actually create resources. Other institutions can utilize them to do important work  but only business can create them. And business creates them when it's able to meet a need at a profit. The resources are overwhelmingly generated by business. The question then is  how do we tap into this  How do we tap into this  Business generates those resources when it makes a profit. That profit is that small difference between the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they're trying to solve. But that profit is the magic. Why  Because that profit allows whatever solution we've created to be infinitely scalable. Because if we can make a profit  we can do it for          a million      million  a billion. The solution becomes self sustaining. That's what business does when it makes a profit. Now what does this all have to do with social problems  Well  one line of thinking is  let's take this profit and redeploy it into social problems. Business should give more. Business should be more responsible. And that's been the path that we've been on in business. But again  this path that we've been on is not getting us where we need to go. Now  I started out as a strategy professor  and I'm still a strategy professor. I'm proud of that. But I've also  over the years  worked more and more on social issues. I've worked on healthcare  the environment  economic development  reducing poverty  and as I worked more and more in the social field  I started seeing something that had a profound impact on me and my whole life  in a way. The conventional wisdom in economics and the view in business has historically been that actually  there's a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance. The conventional wisdom has been that business actually makes a profit by causing a social problem. The classic example is pollution. If business pollutes  it makes more money than if it tried to reduce that pollution. Reducing pollution is expensive  therefore businesses don't want to do it. It's profitable to have an unsafe working environment. It's too expensive to have a safe working environment  therefore business makes more money if they don't have a safe working environment. That's been the conventional wisdom. A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom. They resisted environmental improvement. They resisted workplace improvement. That thinking has led to  I think  much of the behavior that we have come to criticize in business  that I come to criticize in business. But the more deeply I got into all these social issues  one after another  and actually  the more I tried to address them myself  personally  in a few cases  through nonprofits that I was involved with  the more I found actually that the reality is the opposite. Business does not profit from causing social problems  actually not in any fundamental sense. That's a very simplistic view. The deeper we get into these issues  the more we start to understand that actually business profits from solving from social problems. That's where the real profit comes. Let's take pollution. We've learned today that actually reducing pollution and emissions is generating profit. It saves money. It makes the business more productive and efficient. It doesn't waste resources. Having a safer working environment actually  and avoiding accidents  it makes the business more profitable  because it's a sign of good processes. Accidents are expensive and costly. Issue by issue by issue  we start to learn that actually there's no trade off between social progress and economic efficiency in any fundamental sense. Another issue is health. I mean  what we've found is actually health of employees is something that business should treasure  because that health allows those employees to be more productive and come to work and not be absent. The deeper work  the new work  the new thinking on the interface between business and social problems is actually showing that there's a fundamental  deep synergy  particularly if you're not thinking in the very short run. In the very short run  you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there's fundamentally opposing goals  but in the long run  ultimately  we're learning in field after field that this is simply not true. So how could we tap into the power of business to address the fundamental problems that we face  Imagine if we could do that  because if we could do it  we could scale. We could tap into this enormous resource pool and this organizational capacity. And guess what  That's happening now  finally  partly because of people like you who have raised these issues now for year after year and decade after decade. We see organizations like Dow Chemical leading the revolution away from trans fat and saturated fat with innovative new products. This is an example of Jain Irrigation. This is a company that's brought drip irrigation technology to thousands and millions of farmers  reducing substantially the use of water. We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria that's figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare of pulp and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees. You see companies like Cisco that are training so far four million people in I.T. skills to actually  yes  be responsible  but help expand the opportunity to disseminate I.T. technology and grow the whole business. There's a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems  and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business. And the question is  how can we get business thinking to adapt this issue of shared value  This is what I call shared value  addressing a social issue with a business model. That's shared value. Shared value is capitalism  but it's a higher kind of capitalism. It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be  meeting important needs  not incrementally competing for trivial differences in product attributes and market share. Shared value is when we can create social value and economic value simultaneously. It's finding those opportunities that will unleash the greatest possibility we have to actually address these social problems because we can scale. We can address shared value at multiple levels. It's real. It's happening. But in order to get this solution working  we have to now change how business sees itself  and this is thankfully underway. Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom that they shouldn't worry about social problems  that this was sort of something on the side  that somebody else was doing it. We're now seeing companies embrace this idea. But we also have to recognize business is not going to do this as effectively as if we have NGOs and government working in partnership with business. The new NGOs that are really moving the needle are the ones that have found these partnerships  that have found these ways to collaborate. The governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots. And government has many ways in which it could impact the willingness and the ability of companies to compete in this way. I think if we can get business seeing itself differently  and if we can get others seeing business differently  we can change the world. I know it. I'm seeing it. I'm feeling it. Young people  I think  my Harvard Business School students  are getting it. If we can break down this sort of divide  this unease  this tension  this sense that we're not fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems  we can break this down  and we finally  I think  can have solutions. Thank you. Here's a question we need to rethink together  What should be the role of money and markets in our societies  Today  there are very few things that money can't buy. If you're sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara  California  you should know that if you don't like the standard accommodations  you can buy a prison cell upgrade. It's true. For how much  do you think  What would you guess  Five hundred dollars  It's not the Ritz Carlton. It's a jail  Eighty two dollars a night. Eighty two dollars a night. If you go to an amusement park and don't want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides  there is now a solution. In many theme parks  you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line. They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets. And this isn't only happening in amusement parks. In Washington  D.C.  long lines  queues sometimes form for important Congressional hearings. Now some people don't like to wait in long queues  maybe overnight  even in the rain. So now  for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don't like to wait  there are companies  line standing companies  and you can go to them. You can pay them a certain amount of money  they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes  and the lobbyist  just before the hearing begins  can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room. Paid line standing. It's happening  the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions  in bigger arenas. Take the way we fight our wars. Did you know that  in Iraq and Afghanistan  there were more private military contractors on the ground than there were U.S. military troops  Now this isn't because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies  but this is what has happened. Over the past three decades  we have lived through a quiet revolution. We've drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy to becoming market societies. The difference is this  A market economy is a tool  a valuable and effective tool  for organizing productive activity  but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale. It's a way of life  in which market thinking and market values begin to dominate every aspect of life  personal relations  family life  health  education  politics  law  civic life. Now  why worry  Why worry about our becoming market societies  For two reasons  I think. One of them has to do with inequality. The more things money can buy  the more affluence  or the lack of it  matters. If the only thing that money determined was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs  then inequality wouldn't matter very much. But when money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the good life    decent health care  access to the best education  political voice and influence in campaigns    when money comes to govern all of those things  inequality matters a great deal. And so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality and its social and civic consequence. That's one reason to worry. There's a second reason apart from the worry about inequality  and it's this  with some social goods and practices  when market thinking and market values enter  they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about. I'd like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism  a cash incentive  and see what you think about it. Many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids  especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds  to study hard  to do well in school  to apply themselves. Some economists have proposed a market solution  Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores or for reading books. They've tried this  actually. They've done some experiments in some major American cities. In New York  in Chicago  in Washington  D.C.  they've tried this  offering    dollars for an A     dollars for a B. In Dallas  Texas  they have a program that offers eight year olds two dollars for each book they read. So let's see what    Some people are in favor  some people are opposed to this cash incentive to motivate achievement. Let's see what people here think about it. Imagine that you are the head of a major school system  and someone comes to you with this proposal. And let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds. You don't have to take it out of your budget. How many would be in favor and how many would be opposed to giving it a try  Let's see by a show of hands. First  how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work  Raise your hand. And how many would be opposed  How many would    So the majority here are opposed  but a sizable minority are in favor. Let's have a discussion. Let's start with those of you who object  who would rule it out even before trying. What would be your reason  Who will get our discussion started  Yes  Heike Moses  Hello everyone  I'm Heike  and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation  so in the respect that children  if they would like to read  you just take this incentive away in just paying them  so it just changes behavior. Michael Sandel  Takes the intrinsic incentive away. What is  or should be  the intrinsic motivation  HM  Well  the intrinsic motivation should be to learn. MS  To learn. HM  To get to know the world. And then  if you stop paying them  what happens then  Then they stop reading  MS  Now  let's see if there's someone who favors  who thinks it's worth trying this. Elizabeth Loftus  I'm Elizabeth Loftus  and you said worth a try  so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things  MS  And measure. And what would you measure  You'd measure how many    EL  How many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them. MS  Oh  after you stopped paying. All right  what about that  HM  To be frank  I just think this is  not to offend anyone  a very American way. MS  All right. What's emerged from this discussion is the following question  Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation  the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey  which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sakes  And people disagree about what the effect will be  but that seems to be the question  that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson  and if it does  what will become of these children later  I should tell you what's happened with these experiments. The cash for good grades has had very mixed results  for the most part has not resulted in higher grades. The two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books. It also led them to read shorter books. But the real question is  what will become of these kids later  Will they have learned that reading is a chore  a form of piecework to be done for pay  that's the worry  or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake  Now  what this  even this brief debate  brings out is something that many economists overlook. Economists often assume that markets are inert  that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange. Market exchange  they assume  doesn't change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged. This may be true enough if we're talking about material goods. If you sell me a flat screen television or give me one as a gift  it will be the same good. It will work the same either way. But the same may not be true if we're talking about nonmaterial goods and social practices such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civic life. In those domains  bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives may undermine or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes worth caring about. Once we see that markets and commerce  when extended beyond the material domain  can change the character of the goods themselves  can change the meaning of the social practices  as in the example of teaching and learning  we have to ask where markets belong and where they don't  where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about. But to have this debate  we have to do something we're not very good at  and that is to reason together in public about the value and the meaning of the social practices we prize  from our bodies to family life to personal relations to health to teaching and learning to civic life. Now these are controversial questions  and so we tend to shrink from them. In fact  during the past three decades  when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige  our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out  empty of larger moral meaning. For fear of disagreement  we shrink from these questions. But once we see that markets change the character of goods  we have to debate among ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods. One of the most corrosive effects of putting a price on everything is on commonality  the sense that we are all in it together. Against the background of rising inequality  marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate lives. We live and work and shop and play in different places. Our children go to different schools. This isn't good for democracy  nor is it a satisfying way to live  even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line. Here's why. Democracy does not require perfect equality  but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life. What matters is that people of different social backgrounds and different walks of life encounter one another  bump up against one another in the ordinary course of life  because this is what teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences. And this is how we come to care for the common good. And so  in the end  the question of markets is not mainly an economic question. It's really a question of how we want to live together. Do we want a society where everything is up for sale  or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy  Thank you very much. The work of a transportation commissioner isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals. It involves the design of cities and the design of city streets. Streets are some of the most valuable resources that a city has  and yet it's an asset that's largely hidden in plain sight. And the lesson from New York over the past six years is that you can update this asset. You can remake your streets quickly  inexpensively  it can provide immediate benefits  and it can be quite popular. You just need to look at them a little differently. This is important because we live in an urban age. For the first time in history  most people live in cities  and the U.N. estimates that over the next    years  the population is going to double on the planet. So the design of cities is a key issue for our future. Mayor Bloomberg recognized this when he launched PlaNYC in     . The plan recognized that cities are in a global marketplace  and that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive and to attract the million more people that are expected to move here  we need to focus on the quality of life and the efficiency of our infrastructure. For many cities  our streets have been in a kind of suspended animation for generations. This is a picture of Times Square in the '  s  and despite all of the technological innovation  cultural changes  political changes  this is Times Square in     . Not much has changed in those    years. So we worked hard to refocus our agenda  to maximize efficient mobility  providing more room for buses  more room for bikes  more room for people to enjoy the city  and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them. We set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks. Having goals is important  because if you want to change and steer the ship of a big city in a new direction  you need to know where you're going and why. The design of a street can tell you everything about what's expected on it. In this case  it's expected that you shelter in place. The design of this street is really to maximize the movement of cars moving as quickly as possible from point A to point B  and it misses all the other ways that a street is used. When we started out  we did some early surveys about how our streets were used  and we found that New York City was largely a city without seats. Pictures like this  people perched on a fire hydrant  not the mark of a world class city. It's not great for parents with kids. It's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers. It's probably not good for the fire hydrants. Certainly not good for the police department. So we worked hard to change that balance  and probably the best example of our new approach is in Times Square. Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through Times Square  and people had tried for years to make changes. They changed signals  they changed lanes  everything they could do to make Times Square work better. It was dangerous  hard to cross the street. It was chaotic. And so  none of those approaches worked  so we took a different approach  a bigger approach  looked at our street differently. And so we did a six month pilot. We closed Broadway from   nd Street to   th Street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space. And the temporary materials are an important part of the program  because we were able to show how it worked. And I work for a data driven mayor  as you probably know. So it was all about the data. So if it worked better for traffic  if it was better for mobility  if it was safer  better for business  we would keep it  and if it didn't work  no harm  no foul  we could put it back the way that it was  because these were temporary materials. And that was a very big part of the buy in  much less anxiety when you think that something can be put back. But the results were overwhelming. Traffic moved better. It was much safer. Five new flagship stores opened. It's been a total home run. Times Square is now one of the top    retail locations on the planet. And this is an important lesson  because it doesn't need to be a zero sum game between moving traffic and creating public space. Every project has its surprises  and one of the big surprises with Times Square was how quickly people flocked to the space. We put out the orange barrels  and people just materialized immediately into the street. It was like a Star Trek episode  you know  They weren't there before  and then zzzzzt  All the people arrived. Where they'd been  I don't know  but they were there. And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us  because the street furniture had not yet arrived. So we went to a hardware store and bought hundreds of lawn chairs  and we put those lawn chairs out on the street. And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town. It wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars. It was about those lawn chairs.  What did you think about the lawn chairs    Do you like the color of the lawn chairs   So if you've got a big  controversial project  think about lawn chairs. This is the final design for Times Square  and it will create a level surface  sidewalk to sidewalk  beautiful pavers that have studs in them to reflect the light from the billboards  creating a great new energy on the street  and we think it's going to really create a great place  a new crossroads of the world that is worthy of its name. And we will be cutting the ribbon on this  the first phase  this December. With all of our projects  our public space projects  we work closely with local businesses and local merchant groups who maintain the spaces  move the furniture  take care of the plants. This is in front of Macy's  and they were a big supporter of this new approach  because they understood that more people on foot is better for business. And we've done these projects all across the city in all kinds of neighborhoods. This is in Bed Stuy  Brooklyn  and you can see the short leg that was there  used for cars  that's not really needed. So what we did is we painted over the street  put down epoxy gravel  and connected the triangle to the storefronts on Grand Avenue  created a great new public space  and it's been great for businesses along Grand Avenue. We did the same thing in DUMBO  in Brooklyn  and this is one of our first projects that we did  and we took an underutilized  pretty dingy looking parking lot and used some paint and planters to transform it over a weekend. And in the three years since we've implemented the project  retail sales have increased     percent. And that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood. We've moved very  very quickly with paint and temporary materials. Instead of waiting through years of planning studies and computer models to get something done  we've done it with paint and temporary materials. And the proof is not in a computer model. It is in the real world performance of the street. You can have fun with paint. All told  we've created over    pedestrian plazas in all five boroughs across the city. We've repurposed    acres of active car lanes and turned them into new pedestrian space. I think one of the successes is in its emulation. You're seeing this kind of approach  since we've painted Times Square  you've seen this approach in Boston  in Chicago  in San Francisco  in Mexico City  Buenos Aires  you name it. This is actually in Los Angeles  and they actually copied even the green dots that we had on the streets. But I can't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods. We also brought this quick acting approach to our cycling program  and in six years turned cycling into a real transportation option in New York. I think it's fair to say    it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike  and now New York has become one of the cycling capitals in the United States. And we moved quickly to create an interconnected network of lanes. You can see the map in     . This is how it looked in      after we built out     miles of on street bike lanes. I love this because it looks so easy. You just click it  and they're there. We also brought new designs to the street. We created the first parking protected bike lane in the United States. We protected bikers by floating parking lanes  and it's been great. Bike volumes have spiked. Injuries to all users  pedestrians  cyclists  drivers  are all down    percent. And we've built    miles of these protected bike lanes  and now you're seeing them pop up all over the country. And you can see here that this strategy has worked. The blue line is the number of cyclists  soaring. The green line is the number of bike lanes. And the yellow line is the number of injuries  which has remained essentially flat. After this big expansion  you've seen no net increase in injuries  and so there is something to that axiom that there is safety in numbers. Not everybody liked the new bike lanes  and there was a lawsuit and somewhat of a media frenzy a couple years ago. One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on Prospect Park West  the most contested piece of land outside of the Gaza Strip.  And this is what we had done. So if you dig below the headlines  though  you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press  far ahead of the politicians. In fact  I think most politicians would be happy to have those kind of poll numbers. Sixty four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes. This summer  we launched Citi Bike  the largest bike share program in the United States  with       bikes and     stations located next to one another. Since we've launched the program  three million trips have been taken. People have ridden seven million miles. That's     times around the globe. And so with this little blue key  you can unlock the keys to the city and this brand new transportation option. And daily usage just continues to soar. What has happened is the average daily ridership on the streets of New York is        people. The high that we've had so far is        in August. Yesterday         people used Citi Bike in New York City. The bikes are being used six times a day. And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders that are on the streets. In the past  it looked like the guy on the left  ninja clad bike messenger. And today  cyclists look like New York City looks. It's diverse    young  old  black  white  women  kids  all getting on a bike. It's an affordable  safe  convenient way to get around. Quite radical. We've also brought this approach to our buses  and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America  the slowest bus speeds. As everybody knows  you can walk across town faster than you can take the bus. And so we focused on the most congested areas of New York City  built out six bus rapid transit lines     miles of new speedy bus lanes. You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus. We've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out because they get ticketed by a camera if they use that lane  and it's been a huge success. I think one of my very favorite moments as transportation commissioner was the day that we launched Citi Bike  and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue in my protected bike lane  and I looked over and I saw pedestrians standing safely on the pedestrian islands  and the traffic was flowing  birds were singing    the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes. It was just fantastic. And this is how it looked six years ago. And so  I think that the lesson that we have from New York is that it's possible to change your streets quickly  it's not expensive  it can provide immediate benefits  and it can be quite popular. You just need to reimagine your streets. They're hidden in plain sight. Thank you.  Iran is Israel's best friend  and we do not intend to change our position in relation to Tehran.  Believe it or not  this is a quote from an Israeli prime minister  but it's not Ben Gurion or Golda Meir from the era of the Shah. It's actually from Yitzhak Rabin. The year is     . Ayatollah Khomeini is still alive  and much like Ahmadinejad today  he's using the worst rhetoric against Israel. Yet  Rabin referred to Iran as a geostrategic friend. Today  when we hear the threats of war and the high rhetoric  we're oftentimes led to believe that this is yet another one of those unsolvable Middle Eastern conflicts with roots as old as the region itself. Nothing could be further from the truth  and I hope today to show you why that is. The relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people throughout history has actually been quite positive  starting in     B.C.  when King Cyrus the Great of Persia liberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity. A third of the Jewish population stayed in Babylonia. They're today's Iraqi Jews. A third migrated to Persia. They're today's Iranian Jews  still        of them living in Iran  making them the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside of Israel itself. And a third returned to historic Palestine  did the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem  financed  incidentally  by Persian tax money. But even in modern times  relations have been close at times. Rabin's statement was a reflection of decades of security and intelligence collaboration between the two  which in turn was born out of perception of common threats. Both states feared the Soviet Union and strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq. And  in addition  the Israeli doctrine of the periphery  the idea that Israel's security was best achieved by creating alliances with the non Arab states in the periphery of the region in order to balance the Arab states in its vicinity. Now  from the Shah's perspective  though  he wanted to keep this as secret as possible  so when Yitzhak Rabin  for instance  traveled to Iran in the '  s  he usually wore a wig so that no one would recognize him. The Iranians built a special tarmac at the airport in Tehran  far away from the central terminal  so that no one would notice the large number of Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran. Now  did all of this end with the Islamic revolution in       In spite of the very clear anti Israeli ideology of the new regime  the geopolitical logic for their collaboration lived on  because they still had common threats. And when Iraq invaded Iran in       Israel feared an Iraqi victory and actively helped Iran by selling it arms and providing it with spare parts for Iran's American weaponry at a moment when Iran was very vulnerable because of an American arms embargo that Israel was more than happy to violate. In fact  back in the     s  it was Israel that lobbied Washington to talk to Iran  to sell arms to Iran  and not pay attention to Iran's anti Israeli ideology. And this  of course  climaxed in the Iran Contra scandal of the     s. But with the end of the Cold War came also the end of the Israeli Iranian cold peace. Suddenly  the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades  more or less evaporated. The Soviet Union collapsed  Iraq was defeated  and a new environment was created in the region in which both of them felt more secure  but they were also now left unchecked. Without Iraq balancing Iran  Iran could now become a threat  some in Israel argued. In fact  the current dynamic that you see between Iran and Israel has its roots more so in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region after the Cold War than in the events of       because at this point  Iran and Israel emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region  and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners  they increasingly came to view each other as rivals and competitors. So Israel  who in the     s lobbied for and improved U.S. Iran relations now feared a U.S. Iran rapprochement  thinking that it would come at Israel's security interests' expense  and instead sought to put Iran in increased isolation. Ironically  this was happening at a time when Iran was more interested in peacemaking with Washington than to see to Israel's destruction. Iran had put itself in isolation because of its radicalism  and after having helped the United States indirectly in the war against Iraq in       the Iranians were hoping that they would be rewarded by being included in the post war security architecture of the region. But Washington chose to ignore Iran's outreach  as it would a decade later in Afghanistan  and instead moved to intensify Iran's isolation  and it is at this point  around       '    that Iran begins to translate its anti Israeli ideology into operational policy. The Iranians believed that whatever they did  even if they moderated their policies  the U.S. would continue to seek Iran's isolation  and the only way Iran could compel Washington to change its position was by imposing a cost on the U.S. if it didn't. The easiest target was the peace process  and now the Iranian ideological bark was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite  and Iran began supporting extensively Palestinian Islamist groups that it previously had shunned. In some ways  this sounds paradoxical  but according to Martin Indyk of the Clinton administration  the Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong  because the more peace there would be between Israel and Palestine  the U.S. believed  the more Iran would get isolated. The more Iran got isolated  the more peace there would be. So according to Indyk  and these are his words  the Iranians had an interest to do us in on the peace process in order to defeat our policy of containment. To defeat our policy of containment  not about ideology. But throughout even the worst times of their entanglement  all sides have reached out to each other. Netanyahu  when he got elected in       reached out to the Iranians to see if there were any ways that the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected. Tehran was not interested. A few years later  the Iranians sent a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration  a proposal that revealed that there was some potential of getting Iran and Israel back on terms again. The Bush administration did not even respond. All sides have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. But this is not an ancient conflict. This is not even an ideological conflict. The ebbs and flows of hostility have not shifted with ideological zeal  but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape. When Iran and Israel's security imperatives dictated collaboration  they did so in spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other. When Iran's ideological impulses collided with its strategic interests  the strategic interests always prevailed. This is good news  because it means that neither war nor enmity is a foregone conclusion. But some want war. Some believe or say that it's       Iran is Germany  and Ahmadinejad is Hitler. If we accept this to be true  that indeed it is       Iran is Germany  Ahmadinejad is Hitler  then the question we have to ask ourself is  who wishes to play the role of Neville Chamberlain  Who will risk peace  This is an analogy that is deliberately aimed at eliminating diplomacy  and when you eliminate diplomacy  you make war inevitable. In an ideological conflict  there can be no truce  no draw  no compromise  only victory or defeat. But rather than making war inevitable by viewing this as ideological  we would be wise to seek ways to make peace possible. Iran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon  only a few decades old in a history of       years  and precisely because its roots are geopolitical  it means that solutions can be found  compromises can be struck  however difficult it yet may be. After all  it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said   You don't make peace with your friends. You make it with your enemies.  Thank you. I'm a physician trained in infectious diseases  and following my training  I moved to Somalia from San Francisco. And my goodbye greeting from the chief of infectious diseases at San Francisco General was   Gary  this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make.  But I landed in a refugee situation that had a million refugees in    camps  and there were six of us doctors. There were many epidemics there. My responsibilities were largely related to tuberculosis  and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera. So it was the spread of tuberculosis and the spread of cholera that I was responsible for inhibiting. And in order to do this work  we  of course  because of the limitation in health workers  had to recruit refugees to be a specialized new category of health worker. Following three years of work in Somalia  I got picked up by the World Health Organization  and got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS. My primary responsibility was Uganda  but also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi and Zaire  now Congo  Tanzania  Malawi  and several other countries. And my last assignment there was to run a unit called intervention development  which was responsible for designing interventions. After    years of working overseas  I was exhausted. I really had very little left. I had been traveling to one country after another. I was emotionally feeling very isolated. I wanted to come home. I'd seen a lot of death  in particular epidemic death  and epidemic death has a different feel to it. It's full of panic and fear  and I'd heard the women wailing and crying in the desert. And I wanted to come home and take a break and maybe start over. I was not aware of any epidemic problems in America. In fact  I wasn't aware of any problems in America. In fact    seriously. And in fact I would visit friends of mine  and I noticed that they had water that came right into their homes. How many of you have such a situation  And some of them  many of them actually  had water that came into more than one room. And I noticed that they would move this little thermoregulatory device to change the temperature in their home by one degree or two degrees. And now I do that. And I really didn't know what I would do  but friends of mine began telling me about children shooting other children with guns. And I asked the question  what are you doing about it  What are you in America doing about it  And there were two essential explanations or ideas that were prevalent. And one was punishment. And this I had heard about before. We who had worked in behavior knew that punishment was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued. It was not a main driver of behavior  nor was it a main driver of behavior change. And besides that  it reminded me of ancient epidemics that were previously completely misunderstood because the science hadn't been there before  epidemics of plague or typhus or leprosy  where the prevalent ideas were that there were bad people or bad humors or bad air  and widows were dragged around the moat  and dungeons were part of the solution. The other explanation or  in a way  the solution suggested  is please fix all of these things  the schools  the community  the homes  the families  everything. And I'd heard this before as well. I'd called this the  everything  theory  or EOE  Everything On Earth. But we'd also realized in treating other processes and problems that sometimes you don't need to treat everything. And so the sense that I had was there was a giant gap here. The problem of violence was stuck  and this has historically been the case in many other issues. Diarrheal diseases had been stuck. Malaria had been stuck. Frequently  a strategy has to be rethought. It's not as if I had any idea what it would look like  but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers and something having to do with behavior change and something having to do with public education. But I began to ask questions and search out the usual things that I had been exploring before  like  what do the maps look like  What do the graphs look like  What does the data look like  And the maps of violence in most U.S. cities looked like this. There was clustering. This reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also in infectious epidemics  for example cholera. And then we looked at the maps  and the maps showed this typical wave upon wave upon wave  because all epidemics are combinations of many epidemics. And it also looked like infectious epidemics. And then we asked the question  well what really predicts a case of violence  And it turns out that the greatest predictor of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence. Which also sounds like  if there is a case of flu  someone gave someone a case of flu  or a cold  or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis is having been exposed to tuberculosis. And so we see that violence is  in a way  behaving like a contagious disease. We're aware of this anyway even in our common experiences or our newspaper stories of the spread of violence from fights or in gang wars or in civil wars or even in genocides. And so there's good news about this  though  because there's a way to reverse epidemics  and there's really only three things that are done to reverse epidemics  and the first of it is interrupting transmission. In order to interrupt transmission  you need to detect and find first cases. In other words  for T.B. you have to find somebody who has active T.B. who is infecting other people. Make sense  And there's special workers for doing that. For this particular problem  we designed a new category of worker who  like a SARS worker or someone looking for bird flu  might find first cases. In this case  it's someone who's very angry because someone looked at his girlfriend or owes him money  and you can find workers and train them into these specialized categories. And the second thing to do  of course  is to prevent further spread  that means to find who else has been exposed  but may not be spreading so much right now like someone with a smaller case of T.B.  or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods  but in the same group  and then they need to be  in a way  managed as well  particular to the specific disease process. And then the third part  the shifting the norms  and that means a whole bunch of community activities  remodeling  public education  and then you've got what you might call group immunity. And that combination of factors is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda was very successfully reversed. And so what we decided to do in the year      is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers  the first being violence interruptors. And then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the United States at the time. So violence interruptors hired from the same group  credibility  trust  access  just like the health workers in Somalia  but designed for a different category  and trained in persuasion  cooling people down  buying time  reframing. And then another category of worker  the outreach workers  to keep people in a way on therapy for six to    months. Just like T.B.  but the object is behavior change. And then a bunch of community activities for changing norms. Now our first experiment of this resulted in a    percent drop in shootings and killings in the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago. And this was a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself  first    or    days  then    days  and then there was unfortunately another shooting in another    days  and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon. They were using parks they weren't using before. The sun was out. Everybody was happy. But of course  the funders said   Wait a second  do it again.  And so we had to then  fortunately  get the funds to repeat this experience  and this is one of the next four neighborhoods that had a    percent drop in shootings and killings. And since that time  this has been replicated    times. There have been independent evaluations supported by the Justice Department and by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins that have shown    to    percent and    to    percent reductions in shootings and killings using this new method. In fact  there have been three independent evaluations of this now. Now we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this  including being featured on The New York Times' Sunday magazine cover story. The Economist in      said this is  the approach that will come to prominence.  And even a movie was made around our work.  The Interrupters  However  not so fast  because a lot of people did not agree with this way of going about it. We got a lot of criticism  a lot of opposition  and a lot of opponents. In other words  what do you mean  health problem  What do you mean  epidemic  What do you mean  no bad guys  And there's whole industries designed for managing bad people. What do you mean  hiring people who have backgrounds  My business friends said   Gary  you're being criticized tremendously. You must be doing something right.  My musician friends added the word  dude.  So anyway  additionally  there was still this problem  and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems. Yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful economies without healing the economy. So what's actually happened is  although there is still some opposition  the movement is clearly growing. Many of the major cities in the U.S.  including New York City and Baltimore and Kansas City  their health departments are running this now. Chicago and New Orleans  the health departments are having a very large role in this. This is being embraced more by law enforcement than it had been years ago. Trauma centers and hospitals are doing their part in stepping up. And the U.S. Conference of Mayors has endorsed not only the approach but the specific model. Where there's really been uptake even faster is in the international environment  where there's a    percent drop in the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico  where interruptions are just beginning in Honduras  where the strategy has been applied in Kenya for the recent elections  and where there have been     interruptions in Iraq. So violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease. So the theory  in a way  is kind of being validated by the treatment. And recently  the Institute of Medicine came out with a workshop report which went through some of the data  including the neuroscience  on how this problem is really transmitted. So I think this is good news  because it allows us an opportunity to come out of the Middle Ages  which is where I feel this field has been. It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility of replacing some of these prisons with playgrounds or parks  and to consider the possibility of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods  and to allow there to be a new strategy  a new set of methods  a new set of workers  science  in a way  replacing morality. And moving away from emotions is the most important part of the solution to science as a more important part of the solution. So I didn't mean to come up with this at all. It was a matter of  I wanted actually a break  and we looked at maps  we looked at graphs  we asked some questions and tried some tools that actually have been used many times before for other things. For myself  I tried to get away from infectious diseases  and I didn't. Thank you. So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online  experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools. And in my job at Twitter  I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well  helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with. And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction. But I want to start and go back to the     s. Long before a little thing called Twitter  radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast. And from those single points emanated stories. Some of them were familiar stories. Some of them were new stories. And for a while they were familiar formats  but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium. Think about episodes that happened live on radio. Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction  you get this new format. And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories. And of course  today  we have an entirely new medium to play with  which is this online world. This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them. There are thousands upon thousands of them. Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster. We've gone to this world of many to many  where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting. And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium. I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation  if you will  that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it  and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create. I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods. The short story  for example  people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e readers  digital marketplaces. One writer  Hugh Howey  experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called  Wool.  And he actually says that he didn't intend for  Wool  to become a series  but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more  and so he gave them more. He gave them  Wool     which was a little bit longer than the first one   Wool     which was even longer  culminating in  Wool     which was a        word novel. I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e books. He was able to write and publish in relatively short order. There was no mediator between him and the audience. It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him. So this whole project was an experiment. It started with the one short story  and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey's format. And that's something that this medium enabled  was experimentation being a part of the format itself. This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called  Black Box.  It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind. Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created. Now Twitter  of course  has a     character limit. Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook  used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet  and those tweets ended up becoming over     of them that were serialized by The New Yorker. Every night  at   p.m.  you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account. I think that's pretty exciting  tune in literary fiction. The experience of Egan's story  of course  like anything on Twitter  there were multiple ways to experience it. You could scroll back through it  but interestingly  if you were watching it live  there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets  you had no control over when you would read them. They were coming at a pretty regular clip  but as the story was building  normally  as a reader  you control how fast you move through a text  but in this case  The New Yorker did  and they were sending you bit by bit by bit  and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line. Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter  Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called  Evidence.  It began with this tweet   On November    at       p.m.  a woman identified as Miranda Brown      of Brooklyn  fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel.  It begins in Elliott's voice  but then Elliott's voice recedes  and we hear the voices of Elsa  Margot and Simon  characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story  a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at       p.m. when this woman falls to her death. These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives. One reviewer called Elliott's story  Twitter fiction done right   because she did. She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time. Interestingly  though  it wasn't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism. It was also Twitter as a production mechanism. Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs. She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line  line by line. I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves  but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter. As you begin to play with flexible identity online  it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world. Things like Invisible Obama or the famous  binders full of women  that came up during the      election cycle  or even the fan fiction universe of  West Wing  Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in  The West Wing   including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode.  Laughter  All of these are rapid iterations on a theme. They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium. You look at something like  West Wing  Twitter  in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world. They comment on politics  they cry out against the evils of Congress. Keep in mind  they're all Democrats. And they engage with the real world. They respond to it. So once you take flexible identity  anonymity  engagement with the real world  and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story  that's when things get really interesting. So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account. It was Mayor Emanuel. It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel  particularly in the expletive department. This foul mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race  providing commentary as it went. It followed all of the natural tropes of a good  solid Twitter parody account  but then started to get weird. And as it progressed  it moved from this commentary to a multi week  real time science fiction epic in which your protagonist  Rahm Emanuel  engages in multi dimensional travel on election day  which is    it didn't actually happen. I double checked the newspapers. And then  very interestingly  it came to an end. This is something that doesn't usually happen with a Twitter parody account. It ended  a true narrative conclusion. And so the author  Dan Sinker  who was a journalist  who was completely anonymous this whole time  I think Dan    it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book  because it was a narrative format in the end  and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats. One of my favorite examples of something that's happening on Twitter right now  actually  is the very absurdist Crimer Show. Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo  with all of the tropes of a television show. Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.  but  man  is it weird. And there are all these times where Crimer  the supercriminal  does all of these TV things. He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera  but these things just happen in text. I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode  spelled E P P A S O D   eppasod   presenting them as episodes really  it creates something new. There is a new  eppasod  of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day  and they're archived that way. And I think this is an interesting experiment in format. Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television. I think in nonfiction real time storytelling  there are a lot of really excellent examples as well. RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day    years ago in exceptional detail  as if you were reading the news reports from that day. And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news. In this particular case  he's talking about drone strikes. I think that in both of these examples  you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling. So with real time storytelling  blurring the lines between fact and fiction  the real world and the digital world  flexible identity  anonymity  these are all tools that we have accessible to us  and I think that they're just the building blocks. They are the bits that we use to create the structures  the frames  that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation. Thank you. So I'm a city planner  an urban designer  former arts advocate  trained in architecture and art history  and I want to talk to you today not about design but about America and how America can be more economically resilient  how America can be healthier  and how America can be more environmentally sustainable. And I realize this is a global forum  but I think I need to talk about America because there is a history  in some places  not all  of American ideas being appropriated  being emulated  for better or for worse  around the world. And the worst idea we've ever had is suburban sprawl. It's being emulated in many places as we speak. By suburban sprawl  I refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use  and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas belching  time wasting and life threatening prosthetic device that many of us need just to  most Americans  in fact  need  just to live their daily lives. And there's an alternative. You know  we say  half the world is living in cities. Well  in America  that living in cities  for many of them  they're living in cities still where they're dependent on that automobile. And what I work for  and to do  is to make our cities more walkable. But I can't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that I've learned from the economists  the epidemiologists and the environmentalists. So these are the three arguments that I'm going to give you quickly today. When I was growing up in the '  s  the typical American spent one tenth of their income  American family  on transportation. Since then  we've doubled the number of roads in America  and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation. Working families  which are defined as earning between        and        dollars a year in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing  slightly more  because of this phenomenon called  drive till you qualify   finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs  so that they're locked in this  two  three hours  four hours a day of commuting. And these are the neighborhoods  for example  in the Central Valley of California that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up  they were decimated. And in fact  these are many of the half vacant communities that you see today. Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage  it goes underwater  and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you're doing. So we know what it's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars. What happens when a city decides it's going to set other priorities  And probably the best example we have here in America is Portland  Oregon. Portland made a bunch of decisions in the     s that began to distinguish it from almost every other American city. While most other cities were growing an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl  they instituted an urban growth boundary. While most cities were reaming out their roads  removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic  they instituted a skinny streets program. And while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways  they actually invested in bicycling and in walking. And they spent    million dollars on bike facilities  which seems like a lot of money  but it was spent over about    years  so two million dollars a year    not that much    and half the price of the one cloverleaf that they decided to rebuild in that city. These changes and others like them changed the way that Portlanders live  and their vehicle miles traveled per day  the amount that each person drives  actually peaked in       has been dropping ever since  and they now drive    percent less than the rest of the country. The typical Portland citizen drives four miles less  and    minutes less per day than they did before. The economist Joe Cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those    minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region. So if they're not spending that money on driving    and by the way     percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy    if they're not spending that money on driving  what are they spending it on  Well  Portland is reputed to have the most roof racks per capita  the most independent bookstores per capita  the most strip clubs per capita. These are all exaggerations  slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth  which is Portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of America. Actually  Oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states  which may be a good thing or a bad thing  but it makes you glad they're driving less. But actually  they're spending most of it in their homes  and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get. But there's a whole other Portland story  which isn't part of this calculus  which is that young  educated people have been moving to Portland in droves  so that between the last two censuses  they had a    percent increase in college educated millennials  which is five times what you saw anywhere else in the country  or  I should say  of the national average. So on the one hand  a city saves money for its residents by being more walkable and more bikeable  but on the other hand  it also is the cool kind of city that people want to be in these days. So the best economic strategy you can have as a city is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a medical cluster  or an aerospace cluster  but to become a place where people want to be. And millennials  certainly  these engines of entrepreneurship     percent of whom decide first where they want to live  then they move there  then they look for a job  they will come to your city. The health argument is a scary one  and you've probably heard part of this argument before. Again  back in the '  s  a lot's changed since then  back in the '  s  one in    Americans was obese. Now one out of three Americans is obese  and a second third of the population is overweight. Twenty five percent of young men and    percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces. According to the Center for Disease Control  fully one third of all children born after      will get diabetes. We have the first generation of children in America who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents. I believe that this American healthcare crisis that we've all heard about is an urban design crisis  and that the design of our cities lies at the cure. Because we've talked a long time about diet  and we know that diet impacts weight  and weight of course impacts health. But we've only started talking about inactivity  and how inactivity born of our landscape  inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk  is driving our weight up. And we finally have the studies  one in Britain called  Gluttony versus sloth  that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity  and found a much higher  stronger correlation between the latter two. Dr. James Levine at  in this case  the aptly named Mayo Clinic put his test subjects in electronic underwear  held their diet steady  and then started pumping the calories in. Some people gained weight  some people didn't gain weight. Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work  they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving  and that in fact those who gained weight were sitting  on average  two hours more per day than those who didn't. So we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity  but even more  we now have studies that tie weight to where you live. Do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city  or where in your city do you live  In San Diego  they used Walk Score    Walk Score rates every address in America and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is    they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods and less walkable neighborhoods. Well guess what  If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. So we have study after study now that's tying where you live to your health  particularly as in America  the biggest health crisis we have is this one that's stemming from environmental induced inactivity. And I learned a new word last week. They call these neighborhoods  obesageneric.  I may have that wrong  but you get the idea. Now that's one thing  of course. Briefly mentioning  we have an asthma epidemic in this country. You probably haven't thought that much about it. Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma  three times what it was in the '  s  and it's almost all coming from car exhaust. American pollution does not come from factories anymore  it comes from tailpipes  and the amount that people are driving in your city  your urban VMT  is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city. And then finally  in terms of driving  there's the issue of the single largest killer of healthy adults  and one of the largest killers of all people  is car crashes. And we take car crashes for granted. We figure it's a natural risk of being on the road. But in fact  here in America     people out of every         die every year from car crashes. We're pretty safe here. Well  guess what  In England  it's seven per        . It's Japan  it's four per        . Do you know where it's three per          New York City. San Francisco  the same thing. Portland  the same thing. Oh  so cities make us safer because we're driving less  Tulsa     per        . Orlando     per        . It's not whether you're in the city or not  it's how is your city designed  Was it designed around cars or around people  Because if your city is designed around cars  it's really good at smashing them into each other. That's part of a much larger health argument. Finally  the environmental argument is fascinating  because the environmentalists turned on a dime about    years ago. The environmental movement in America has historically been an anti city movement from Jefferson on.  Cities are pestilential to the health  to the liberties  to the morals of man. If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities  as they do in Europe  we shall become as corrupt as they are in Europe and take to eating one another as they do there.  He apparently had a sense of humor. And then the American environmental movement has been a classically Arcadian movement. To become more environmental  we move into the country  we commune with nature  we build suburbs. But  of course  we've seen what that does. The carbon mapping of America  where is the CO  being emitted  for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly. If you look at any carbon map  because we map it per square mile  any carbon map of the U.S.  it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.  hottest in the cities  cooler in the suburbs  dark  peaceful in the countryside. Until some economists said  you know  is that the right way to measure CO   There are only so many people in this country at any given time  and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact. And they said  let's measure CO  per household  and when they did that  the maps just flipped  coolest in the center city  warmer in the suburbs  and red hot in these exurban  drive till you qualify  neighborhoods. So a fundamental shift  and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species. If you love nature  the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it  move to a city  and the denser the better  and the denser cities like Manhattan are the cities that perform the best. So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '  s  consuming half of the electricity of Dallas. But of course  we can do better. Canadian cities  they consume half the gasoline of American cities. European cities consume half as much again. So obviously  we can do better  and we want to do better  and we're all trying to be green. My final argument in this topic is that I think we're trying to be green the wrong way  and I'm one of many people who believes that this focus on gadgets  on accessorizing    What can I add to my house  what can I add to what I've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable     has kind of dominated the discussion. So I'm not immune to this. My wife and I built a new house on an abandoned lot in Washington  D.C.  and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store. We've got the solar photovoltaic system  solar hot water heater  dual flush toilets  bamboo floors. A log burning in my German high tech stove apparently  supposedly  contributes less carbon to the atmosphere than were it left alone to decompose in the forest. Yet all of these innovations    That's what they said in the brochure. All of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city. We've changed all our light bulbs to energy savers  and you should do the same thing  but changing all your light bulbs to energy savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week. And we don't want to have this argument. Politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a  lifestyle choice.  You don't want to tell Americans  God forbid  that they have to change their lifestyle. But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more  something that would be better than what we have right now  Well  the gold standard of quality of life rankings  it's called the Mercer Survey. You may have heard of it. They rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to    criteria that they believe add up to quality of life  health  economics  education  housing  you name it. There's six more. Short talk. And it's very interesting to see that the highest ranking American city  Honolulu  number     is followed by kind of the usual suspects of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. The driving cities in the Sun Belt  the Dallases and the Phoenixes and  sorry  Atlanta  these cities are not appearing on the list. But who's doing even better  The Canadian cities like Vancouver  where again  they're burning half the fuel. And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German  like Dusseldorf or Vienna  where they're burning  again  half as much fuel. And you see this alignment  this strange alignment. Is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life  I would argue the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life  and that's living in a walkable neighborhood. So sustainability  which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability. But particularly here in America  we are polluting so much because we're throwing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway  then these two problems would seem to share the same solution  which is to make our cities more walkable. Doing so isn't easy  but it can be done  it has been done  and it's being done now in more than a few cities  around the globe and in our country. I take some solace from Winston Churchill  who put it this way   The Americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives.   Laughter  Thank you. So I'd like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China  the night I met my husband. It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking. So I went to a party. I sat down next to a stout  middle aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie  and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar  there in China specifically to study Sino Soviet relations. What a gift it was to the eager  young foreign correspondent that I was then. I'd pump him for information  I'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write. I talk to him for hours. Only months later  I discover who he really was. He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association.  I don't understand. Soybeans  You told me you were a Fulbright scholar.   Well  how long would you have talked to me if I told you we're in soybeans   I said   You jerk.  Only jerk wasn't the word I used. I said   You could've gotten me fired.  And he said   Let's get married.   Travel the world and have lots of kids.  So we did. And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be. He was a Chinese scholar who later  in his   s  got a Ph.D. in Chinese history. He spoke six languages  he played    musical instruments  he was a licensed pilot  he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator  he was an expert in swine nutrition  dairy cattle  Dixieland jazz  film noir  and we did travel the country  and the world  and we did have a lot of kids. We followed my job  and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn't do. So when we found the cancer  it doesn't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other  we believed that  if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough  and we worked hard enough  we could keep him from dying ever. And for years  it seemed like we were succeeding. The surgeon emerged from the surgery. What'd he say  He said what surgeons always say   We got it all.  Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely. It turned out to be a rare  exceedingly aggressive type  with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most. And yet  he did not die. Mysteriously  he lived on. He coached Little League for our son. He built a playhouse for our daughter. And meanwhile  I'm burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists. I'm looking for a cure. So a year goes by before the cancer  as cancers do  reappears  and with it comes another death sentence  this time nine months. So we try another treatment  aggressive  nasty. It makes him so sick  he has to quit it  yet still he lives on. Then another year goes by. Two years go by. More specialists. We take the kids to Italy. We take the kids to Australia. And then more years pass  and the cancer begins to grow. This time  there's new treatments on the horizon. They're exotic. They're experimental. They're going to attack the cancer in new ways. So he enters a clinical trial  and it works. The cancer begins to shrink  and for the third time  we've dodged death. So now I ask you  how do I feel when the time finally comes and there's another dark night  sometime between midnight and   a.m.  This time it's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I've never met before tells me that Terence is dying  perhaps tonight. So what do I say when he says   What do you want me to do   There's another drug out there. It's newer. It's more powerful. He started it just two weeks ago. Perhaps there's still hope ahead. So what do I say  I say   Keep him alive if you can.  And Terence died six days later. So we fought  we struggled  we triumphed. It was an exhilarating fight  and I'd repeat the fight today without a moment's hesitation. We fought together  we lived together. It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious. It was also an expensive fight. It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end of life care  and of healthcare for all of us. And for me  for us  we pushed the fight right over the edge  and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day   Hey  buddy  it was a hell of a ride.  We never got the chance to say goodbye. We never thought it was the end. We always had hope. So what do we make of all of this  Being a journalist  after Terence died  I wrote a book   The Cost Of Hope.  I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did  why he did what he did  why everyone around us did what they did. And what did I discover  Well  one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper  the advance directive  to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices. Yet I had that piece of paper. We both did. And they were readily available. I had them right at hand. Both of them said the same thing  Do nothing if there is no further hope. I knew Terence's wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own. Yet we never got to no further hope. Even with that clear cut paper in our hands  we just kept redefining hope. I believed I could keep him from dying  and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way. Right up until days before his death  I felt strongly and powerfully  and  you might say  irrationally  that I could keep him from dying ever. Now  what do the experts call this  They say it's denial. It's a strong word  isn't it  Yet I will tell you that denial isn't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through. And I hear the medical professionals say   Well  we'd like to do such and such  but the family's in denial. The family won't listen to reason. They're in denial. How can they insist on this treatment at the end  It's so clear  yet they're in denial.  Now  I think this maybe isn't a very useful way of thinking. It's not just families either. The medical professionals too  you out there  you're in denial too. You want to help. You want to fix. You want to do. You've succeeded in everything you've done  and having a patient die  well  that must feel like failure. I saw it firsthand. Just days before Terence died  his oncologist said   Tell Terence that better days are just ahead.  Days before he died. Yet Ira Byock  the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said   You know  the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal.  So what the experts call  denial   I call  hope   and I'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design. You just redefine denial and hope  and it becomes a feature of being human. It's not a bug. It's a feature. So we need to think more constructively about this very common  very profound and very powerful human emotion. It's part of the human condition  and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it. So Terence told me a story on that long ago night  and I believed it. Maybe I wanted to believe it. And during Terence's illness  I  we  we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too. Giving up the fight    for that's how it felt  it felt like giving up    meant giving up not only his life but also our story  our story of us as fighters  the story of us as invincible  and for the doctors  the story of themselves as healers. So what do we need  Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper. Maybe we need a new story  not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness  but rather a story of victory and triumph  of a valiant battle and  eventually  a graceful retreat  a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe  that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal  and that no wife  no matter how hard she tried  has ever stopped even the bravest  wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go. People did mention hospice  but I wouldn't listen. Hospice was for people who were dying  and Terence wasn't dying. As a result  he spent just four days in hospice  which I'm sure  as you all know  is a pretty typical outcome  and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end. We have a noble path to curing the disease  patients and doctors alike  but there doesn't seem to be a noble path to dying. Dying is seen as failing  and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together  but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go. So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end  and for saying goodbye  and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight  and a hero's goodbye. Terence loved poetry  and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets. So I'll give you a couple lines from him. This is a poem about Mark Antony. You know Mark Antony  the conquering hero  Cleopatra's guy  Actually  one of Cleopatra's guys. And he's been a pretty good general. He's won all the fights  he's eluded all the people that are out to get him  and yet this time  finally  he's come to the city of Alexandria and realized he's lost. The people are leaving. They're playing instruments. They're singing. And suddenly he knows he's been defeated. And he suddenly knows he's been deserted by the gods  and it's time to let go. And the poet tells him what to do. He tells him how to say a noble goodbye  a goodbye that's fit for a hero.  As if long prepared  as if courageous  as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city  approach the window with a firm step  and with emotion  but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward  as a last enjoyment  listen to the sounds  the exquisite instruments of the musical troops  and bid her farewell  the Alexandria you are losing.  That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life  a goodbye for a man for whom anything  well  almost anything  was possible  a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive. And isn't that what we're missing  How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly  powerfully  many times irrationally  on the slimmest of hopes  The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial. It's part of our DNA as humans  and maybe it's time our healthcare system    doctors  patients  insurance companies  us  started accounting for the power of that hope. Hope isn't a bug. It's a feature. Thank you. Throughout my career  I've been fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects  documenting their work and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they sit. I think of new cities like Dubai or ancient cities like Rome with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum  or like right here in New York with the High Line  a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this. But what I find really fascinating is what happens when architects and planners leave and these places become appropriated by people  like here in Chandigarh  India  the city which has been completely designed by the architect Le Corbusier. Now    years later  the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for  like here  where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall. But over the course of several years  I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's CCTV building in Beijing and the olympic stadium in the same city by the architects Herzog and de Meuron. At these large scale construction sites in China  you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process. As the length of the construction takes years  workers end up forming a rather rough and ready informal city  making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they're building. Over the past seven years  I've been following my fascination with the built environment  and for those of you who know me  you would say that this obsession has led me to live out of a suitcase     days a year. Being constantly on the move means that sometimes I am able to catch life's most unpredictable moments  like here in New York the day after the Sandy storm hit the city. Just over three years ago  I was for the first time in Caracas  Venezuela  and while flying over the city  I was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city  a place where nearly    percent of the population lives in slums  draped literally all over the mountains. During a conversation with local architects Urban Think Tank  I learned about the Torre David  a    story office building which sits right in the center of Caracas. The building was under construction until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early '  s. About eight years ago  people started moving into the abandoned tower and began to build their homes right in between every column of this unfinished tower. There's only one little entrance to the entire building  and the       residents come in and out through that single door. Together  the inhabitants created public spaces and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an unfinished tower. In the lobby  they painted the walls and planted trees. They also made a basketball court. But when you look up closely  you see massive holes where elevators and services would have run through. Within the tower  people have come up with all sorts of solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower. With no elevators  the tower is like a    story walkup. Designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven't had any education in architecture or design. And with each inhabitant finding their own unique way of coming by  this tower becomes like a living city  a place which is alive with micro economies and small businesses. The inventive inhabitants  for instance  find opportunities in the most unexpected cases  like the adjacent parking garage  which has been reclaimed as a taxi route to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps in order to shorten the hike up to the apartments. A walk through the tower reveals how residents have figured out how to create walls  how to make an air flow  how to create transparency  circulation throughout the tower  essentially creating a home that's completely adapted to the conditions of the site. When a new inhabitant moves into the tower  they already have a roof over their head  so they just typically mark their space with a few curtains or sheets. Slowly  from found materials  walls rise  and people create a space out of any found objects or materials. It's remarkable to see the design decisions that they're making  like when everything is made out of red bricks  some residents will cover that red brick with another layer of red brick patterned wallpaper just to make it a kind of clean finish. The inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands  and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride in many families living in this tower. They typically make the best out of their conditions  and try to make their spaces look nice and homey  or at least up until as far as they can reach. Throughout the tower  you come across all kinds of services  like the barber  small factories  and every floor has a little grocery store or shop. And you even find a church. And on the   th floor  there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed. From the outside  behind this always changing facade  you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic  intuitive way that responds directly to their needs. Let's go now to Africa  to Nigeria  to a community called Makoko  a slum where         people live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon. While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place  when you see it from above  there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home. From the main dock  people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area. When out on the water  it's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living. Even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house  selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits. Behind every window and door frame  you'll see a small child peering back at you  and while Makoko seems to be packed with people  what's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building. The population growth in Nigeria  and especially in these areas like Makoko  are painful reminders of how out of control things really are. In Makoko  very few systems and infrastructures exist. Electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self built wells throughout the area. This entire economic model is designed to meet a specific way of living on the water  so fishing and boat making are common professions. You'll have a set of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses throughout the area  like barbershops  CD and DVD stores  movie theaters  tailors  everything is there. There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place  like that hotel in Sweden. On this particular evening  I came across this live band dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits. They were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted out generator for all of the community to enjoy. By nightfall  the area becomes almost pitch black  save for a small lightbulb or a fire. What originally brought me to Makoko was this project from a friend of mine  Kunl  Adeyemi  who recently finished building this three story floating school for the kids in Makoko. With this entire village existing on the water  public space is very limited  so now that the school is finished  the ground floor is a playground for the kids  but when classes are out  the platform is just like a town square  where the fishermen mend their nets and floating shopkeepers dock their boats. Another place I'd like to share with you is the Zabbaleen in Cairo. They're descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper Egypt in the '  s  and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over Cairo. For years  the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities  but in the early     s  they settled on the Mokattam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city. Today  they live in this area  approximately        to        people  who live in this community of self built multi story houses where up to three generations live in one structure. While these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid  each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for garbage related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space. I find it incredible to see how these piles and piles of garbage are invisible to the people who live there  like this very distinguished man who is posing while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him  or like these two young men who are sitting and chatting amongst these tons of garbage. While to most of us  living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable  to those in the Zabbaleen  this is just a different type of normal. In all these places I've talked about today  what I do find fascinating is that there's really no such thing as normal  and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation. Throughout the day  it's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets  just like this engagement party. In this tradition  the bride to be displays all of their belongings  which they soon bring to their new husband. A gathering like this one offers such a juxtaposition where all the new stuff is displayed and all the garbage is used as props to display all their new home accessories. Like Makoko and the Torre David  throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood. There are the retail shops  the cafes and the restaurants  and the community is this community of Coptic Christians  so you'll also find a church  along with the scores of religious iconographies throughout the area  and also all the everyday services like the electronic repair shops  the barbers  everything. Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen is also full of surprises. While from the outside  these homes look like any other informal structure in the city  when you step inside  you are met with all manner of design decisions and interior decoration. Despite having limited access to space and money  the homes in the area are designed with care and detail. Every apartment is unique  and this individuality tells a story about each family's circumstances and values. Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously  putting a lot of work and care into the details. The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner  where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns. But despite this elaborate decor  sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways  like this home which caught my attention while all the mud and the grass was literally seeping out under the front door. When I was let in  it appeared that this fifth floor apartment was being transformed into a complete animal farm  where six or seven cows stood grazing in what otherwise would be the living room. But then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the nicest apartments in the area. The attention to this detail astonished me  and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment  from floor to ceiling  every part was decorated. But if it weren't for the strangely familiar stomach churning odor that constantly passes through the apartment  it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a cow shed and on top of a landfill. What moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions  I was welcomed with open arms into a home that was made with love  care  and unreserved passion. Let's move across the map to China  to an area called Shanxi  Henan and Gansu. In a region famous for the soft  porous Loess Plateau soil  there lived until recently an estimated    million people in these houses underground. These dwellings are called the yaodongs. Through this architecture by subtraction  these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil. In these villages  you see an entirely altered landscape  and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square  rectangular houses which sit seven meters below the ground. When I asked people why they were digging their houses from the ground  they simply replied that they are poor wheat and apple farmers who didn't have the money to buy materials  and this digging out was their most logical form of living. From Makoko to Zabbaleen  these communities have approached the tasks of planning  design and management of their communities and neighborhoods in ways that respond specifically to their environment and circumstances. Created by these very people who live  work and play in these particular spaces  these neighborhoods are intuitively designed to make the most of their circumstances. In most of these places  the government is completely absent  leaving inhabitants with no choice but to reappropriate found materials  and while these communities are highly disadvantaged  they do present examples of brilliant forms of ingenuity  and prove that indeed we have the ability to adapt to all manner of circumstances. What makes places like the Torre David particularly remarkable is this sort of skeleton framework where people can have a foundation where they can tap into. Now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves  and how highly particular their solutions would be  if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into. Today  you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people. From China to Brazil  these projects attempt to provide as many houses as possible  but they're completely generic and simply do not work as an answer to the individual needs of the people. I would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration  Zita Cobb  the founder of the wonderful Shorefast Foundation  based out of Fogo Island  Newfoundland. She says that  there's this plague of sameness which is killing the human joy   and I couldn't agree with her more. Thank you. I would like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving Adam and Eve  and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past    years. You know the incident. Adam and Eve one day in the Garden of Eden realize they are naked. They freak out. And the rest is history. Nowadays  Adam and Eve would probably act differently.   Adam Last nite was a blast  loved dat apple LOL    Eve yep.. babe  know what happened to my pants tho   We do reveal so much more information about ourselves online than ever before  and so much information about us is being collected by organizations. Now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information  or big data  but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy. And my story is about these tradeoffs. We start with an observation which  in my mind  has become clearer and clearer in the past few years  that any personal information can become sensitive information. Back in the year       about     billion photos were shot worldwide  but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online. In       only on Facebook  in a single month   .  billion photos were uploaded  most of them identified. In the same span of time  computers' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude. What happens when you combine these technologies together  increasing availability of facial data  improving facial recognizing ability by computers  but also cloud computing  which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three letter agencies  and ubiquitous computing  which allows my phone  which is not a supercomputer  to connect to the Internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds  Well  we conjecture that the result of this combination of technologies will be a radical change in our very notions of privacy and anonymity. To test that  we did an experiment on Carnegie Mellon University campus. We asked students who were walking by to participate in a study  and we took a shot with a webcam  and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop. While they were filling out the survey  we uploaded their shot to a cloud computing cluster  and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images which we had downloaded from Facebook profiles. By the time the subject reached the last page on the survey  the page had been dynamically updated with the    best matching photos which the recognizer had found  and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo. Do you see the subject  Well  the computer did  and in fact did so for one out of three subjects. So essentially  we can start from an anonymous face  offline or online  and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data. But a few years back  we did something else. We started from social media data  we combined it statistically with data from U.S. government social security  and we ended up predicting social security numbers  which in the United States are extremely sensitive information. Do you see where I'm going with this  So if you combine the two studies together  then the question becomes  can you start from a face and  using facial recognition  find a name and publicly available information about that name and that person  and from that publicly available information infer non publicly available information  much more sensitive ones which you link back to the face  And the answer is  yes  we can  and we did. Of course  the accuracy keeps getting worse.      of subjects' first   SSN digits identified  with   attempts   But in fact  we even decided to develop an iPhone app which uses the phone's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what I just described to you in real time  looking for a match  finding public information  trying to infer sensitive information  and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject  an example of augmented reality  probably a creepy example of augmented reality. In fact  we didn't develop the app to make it available  just as a proof of concept. In fact  take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme. Imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their Google Glasses or  one day  their contact lenses  and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you. What will this future without secrets look like  And should we care  We may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases  but in fact  having so much information doesn't mean that we will make decisions which are more objective. In another experiment  we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate. We included in this information some references to some funny  absolutely legal  but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online. Now interestingly  among our subjects  some had posted comparable information  and some had not. Which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly our subject  Paradoxically  it was the group who had posted similar information  an example of moral dissonance. Now you may be thinking  this does not apply to me  because I have nothing to hide. But in fact  privacy is not about having something negative to hide. Imagine that you are the H.R. director of a certain organization  and you receive r sum s  and you decide to find more information about the candidates. Therefore  you Google their names and in a certain universe  you find this information. Or in a parallel universe  you find this information. Do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview  If you think so  then you are not like the U.S. employers who are  in fact  part of our experiment  meaning we did exactly that. We created Facebook profiles  manipulating traits  then we started sending out r sum s to companies in the U.S.  and we detected  we monitored  whether they were searching for our candidates  and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media. And they were. Discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates. Now marketers like us to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor. But think again. Why should that be always the case  In a movie which came out a few years ago   Minority Report   a famous scene had Tom Cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him. Now  that movie is set in       about    years from now  and as exciting as that technology looks  it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you  and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect. So as an example  this is another experiment actually we are running  not yet completed. Imagine that an organization has access to your list of Facebook friends  and through some kind of algorithm they can detect the two friends that you like the most. And then they create  in real time  a facial composite of these two friends. Now studies prior to ours have shown that people don't recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites  but they react to those composites in a positive manner. So next time you are looking for a certain product  and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it  it will not be just a standard spokesperson. It will be one of your friends  and you will not even know that this is happening. Now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight. One of these mechanisms is transparency  telling people what you are going to do with their data. And in principle  that's a very good thing. It's necessary  but it is not sufficient. Transparency can be misdirected. You can tell people what you are going to do  and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information. So in yet another experiment  this one with students  we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior  including pretty sensitive questions  such as this one.  Have you ever cheated in an exam   Now to one group of subjects  we told them   Only other students will see your answers.  To another group of subjects  we told them   Students and faculty will see your answers.  Transparency. Notification. And sure enough  this worked  in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second. It makes sense  right  But then we added the misdirection. We repeated the experiment with the same two groups  this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions. How long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect of knowing that faculty would see your answers  Ten minutes  Five minutes  One minute  How about    seconds  Fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups disclose the same amount of information  as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers. Now I have to admit that this talk so far may sound exceedingly gloomy  but that is not my point. In fact  I want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives. The way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done  and certainly not the best way they can be done. When someone tells you   People don't care about privacy   consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy  and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself. When someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data  consider that in the last    years  researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy preserving manner. We can browse the Internet anonymously. We can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient  not even the NSA. We can have even privacy preserving data mining. In other words  we can have the benefits of big data while protecting privacy. Of course  these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects  which is why  perhaps  you don't hear more about them. Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden. There is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the Garden of Eden which doesn't have to do with the issue of Adam and Eve feeling naked and feeling ashamed. You can find echoes of this interpretation in John Milton's  Paradise Lost.  In the garden  Adam and Eve are materially content. They're happy. They are satisfied. However  they also lack knowledge and self awareness. The moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge  that's when they discover themselves. They become aware. They achieve autonomy. The price to pay  however  is leaving the garden. So privacy  in a way  is both the means and the price to pay for freedom. Again  marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them  but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us. We get free content. We get to play Angry Birds. We get targeted apps. But in fact  in a few years  organizations will know so much about us  they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them  and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them. Now there was one English author who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom for comfort. Even more so than George Orwell  the author is  of course  Aldous Huxley. In  Brave New World   he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing us. However  in the book  he also offers us a way out of that society  similar to the path that Adam and Eve had to follow to leave the garden. In the words of the Savage  regaining autonomy and freedom is possible  although the price to pay is steep. So I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information  the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom  rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us. Right now  many of us do not even know that the fight is going on  but it is  whether you like it or not. And at the risk of playing the serpent  I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here  the awareness of what is going on  and in your hands  just a few clicks away. Thank you. Hetain Patel   In Chinese  Yuyu Rau  Hi  I'm Hetain. I'm an artist. And this is Yuyu  who is a dancer I have been working with. I have asked her to translate for me. HP   In Chinese  YR  If I may  I would like to tell you a little bit about myself and my artwork. HP   In Chinese  YR  I was born and raised near Manchester  in England  but I'm not going to say it in English to you  because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent. HP   In Chinese  YR  The only problem with masking it with Chinese Mandarin is I can only speak this paragraph  which I have learned by heart when I was visiting in China.  Laughter  So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you won't notice. HP   In Chinese  YR  Needless to say  I would like to apologize to any Mandarin speakers in the audience. As a child  I would hate being made to wear the Indian kurta pajama  because I didn't think it was very cool. It felt a bit girly to me  like a dress  and it had this baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down. My dad never wore it  so I didn't see why I had to. Also  it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable  that people assume I represent something genuinely Indian when I wear it  because that's not how I feel. HP   In Chinese  YR  Actually  the only way I feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like Li Mu Bai from that film   Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon.  Okay. So my artwork is about identity and language  challenging common assumptions based on how we look like or where we come from  gender  race  class. What makes us who we are anyway  HP   In Chinese  YR  I used to read Spider Man comics  watch kung fu movies  take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee. He would say things like    HP  Empty your mind.

HP  A few years ago  in order to make this video for my artwork  I shaved off all my hair so that I could grow it back as my father had it when he first emigrated from India to the U.K. in the     s. He had a side parting and a neat mustache. At first  it was going very well. I even started to get discounts in Indian shops. But then very quickly  I started to underestimate my mustache growing ability  and it got way too big. It didn't look Indian anymore. Instead  people from across the road  they would shout things like    HP and YR  Arriba  Arriba   ndale   ndale  HP  Actually  I don't know why I am even talking like this. My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore. He talks like this now. So it's not just my father that I've imitated. A few years ago I went to China for a few months  and I couldn't speak Chinese  and this frustrated me  so I wrote about this and had it translated into Chinese  and then I learned this by heart  like music  I guess. YR  This phrase is now etched into my mind clearer than the pin number to my bank card  so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently. When I had learned this phrase  I had an artist over there hear me out to see how accurate it sounded. I spoke the phrase  and then he laughed and told me   Oh yeah  that's great  only it kind of sounds like a woman.  I said   What   He said   Yeah  you learned from a woman   I said   Yes. So   He then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct  and that I had learned it very well  but in a woman's voice. HP  Okay. So this imitation business does come with risk. It doesn't always go as you plan it  even with a talented translator. But I am going to stick with it  because contrary to what we might usually assume  imitating somebody can reveal something unique. So every time I fail to become more like my father  I become more like myself. Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee  I become more authentically me. This is my art. I strive for authenticity  even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect. It's only recently that I've started to understand that I didn't learn to sit like this through being Indian. I learned this from Spider Man. Thank you. I've spent my life working on sustainability. I set up a climate change NGO called The Climate Group. I worked on forestry issues in WWF. I worked on development and agriculture issues in the U.N. system. About    years in total  and then three years ago  I found myself talking to IKEA's CEO about joining his team. Like many people here  well  I want to maximize my personal impact in the world  so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there. But first  let's just take three numbers. The first number is three  three billion people. This is the number of people joining the global middle class by       coming out of poverty. It's fantastic for them and their families  but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today  and this swells that number to five  a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity. The second number is six  This is six degrees centigrade  what we're heading towards in terms of global warming. We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees  we're heading toward six degrees. And if you think about it  all of the weird weather we've been having the last few years  much of that is due to just one degree warming  and we need CO  emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down. It's not inevitable  but we need to act decisively. The third number is     That's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born. You can see my grandmother there. That was in the beginning of the last century. So just    cities. She was born in Manchester  England  the ninth largest city in the world. Now there are     cities  nearly  with a million people or more in them. And if you look at the century from      to       that's the century when we build all the world's cities  the century that we're in the middle of right now. Every other century was kind of practice  and this lays down a blueprint for how we live. So think about it. We're building cities like never before  bringing people out of poverty like never before  and changing the climate like never before. Sustainability has gone from a nice to do to a must do. it's about what we do right here  right now  and for the rest of our working lives. So I'm going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like IKEA can do  and we have a sustainability strategy called  people and planet positive  to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world. Why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business  Other companies have sustainability strategies. I'm going to refer to some of those as well  and I'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we've got. But first  let's think of customers. We know from asking people from China to the U.S. that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day to day issues  the day to day issues of  how do I get my kids to school  Can I pay the bills at the end of the month  Then they care about big issues like climate change. But they want it to be easy  affordable and attractive  and they expect business to help  and they're a little bit disappointed today. So take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products. We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer. We had the early energy efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color. And we had the rough  recycled toilet paper. So every time you pulled on a t shirt  or switched the light on  or went to the bathroom  or sometimes all three together  you were reminded sustainability was about compromise. It wasn't a great start. Today we have choices. We can make products that are beautiful or ugly  sustainable or unsustainable  affordable or expensive  functional or useless. So let's make beautiful  functional  affordable  sustainable products. Let's take the LED. The LED is the next best thing to daylight. The old fashioned lightbulbs  the incandescent bulbs    I'm not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes  wasting energy every time you switch them on    change them after this    or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not    but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters. They were mis sold for more than a hundred years. They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side. Now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side. You save    percent of the electricity with an LED that you would have done in an old incandescent. And the best thing is  they'll also last for more than    years. So think about that. You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times  probably more if you're in this audience. You'll change your car  if you have one  three or four times. Your kids could go to school  go to college  go away and have kids of their own  come back  bring the grandkids  you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy. So LEDs are fantastic. What we decided to do was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs  the halogens and the CFLs. We decided  over the next two years  we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves. We will go all in. And this is what business needs to do  go all in  go     percent  because then you stop investing in the old stuff  you invest in the new stuff  you lower costs  you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy. It's not just about products in people's homes. We've got to think about the raw materials that produce our products. Obviously there's fantastic opportunities with recycled materials  and we can and will go zero waste. And there's opportunities in a circular economy. But we're still dependent on natural  raw materials. Let's take cotton. Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people are wearing cotton right now. It's a brilliant textile in use. It's really dirty in production. It uses lots of pesticides  lots of fertilizer  lots of water. So we've worked with others  with other businesses and NGOs  on the Better Cotton Initiative  working right back down to the farm  and there you can halve the amount of water and halve the chemical inputs  the yields increase  and    percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes can be chemical imports. Yields increase  and you halve the input costs. Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it. Already hundreds of thousands of farmers have been reached  and now we've got    percent better cotton in our business. Again  we're going all in. By       we'll be     percent Better Cotton. Take the topic of     percent targets  actually. People sometimes think that     percent's going to be hard  and we've had the conversation in the business. Actually  we found     percent is easier to do than    percent or    percent. If you have a    percent target  everyone in the business finds a reason to be in the    percent. When it's     percent  it's kind of clear  and businesspeople like clarity  because then you just get the job done. So  wood. We know with forestry  it's a choice. You've got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale  or you can have fantastic  responsible forestry that we can be proud of. It's a simple choice  so we've worked for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council  with literally hundreds of other organizations  and there's a point here about collaboration. So hundreds of others  of NGOs  of forest workers' unions  and of businesses  have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council  which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestry's good on the ground. Now together  through our supply chain  with partners  we've managed to certify    million hectares of forestry. That's about the size of Germany. And we've decided in the next three years  we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business. So be decisive on these issues. Use your supply chain to drive good. But then it comes to your operations. Some things are certain  I think. We know we'll use electricity in    or    years' time. We know the sun will be shining somewhere  and the wind will still be blowing in    or    years' time. So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind  And why not take control of it ourselves  So we're going     percent renewable. By       we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business. For all of our stores  our own factories  our distribution centers  we've installed         solar panels so far  and we've got    wind farms we own and operate in six countries  and we're not done yet. But think of a solar panel. A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years. The electricity is free. Every time the sun comes out after that  the electricity is free. So this is a good thing for the CFO  not just the sustainability guy. Every business can do things like this. But then we've got to look beyond our operations  and I think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain. Many businesses now  fortunately  have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains  but not every business. Far from it. And this came in IKEA actually in the '  s. We found there was a risk of child labor in the supply chain  and people in the business were shocked. And it was clearly totally unacceptable  so then you have to act. So a code of conduct was developed  and now we have    auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor. But it's not just as simple as making sure there's no child labor. You've got to say that's not enough today. I think we'd all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable. So what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights  We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children's rights. Increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these  but actually in a survey  many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children. So what we decided to do was  we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us  what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children  We also have a foundation that's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of     million children by     . You know the phrase  you can manage what you measure  Well  you should measure what you care about. If you're not measuring things  you don't care and you don't know. So let's take an example  measure the things that are important in your business. Isn't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women  So we know for our        managers across IKEA that    percent are women today  but it's not enough  and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management. And we do not want to wait another hundred years. So we've launched a women's open network this week in IKEA  and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change. So the message here is  measure what you care about and lead the change  and don't wait a hundred years. So we've gone from sustainability being a nice to do to a must do. It's a must do. It's still nice to do  but it's a must do. And everybody can do something on this as an individual. Be a discerning consumer. Vote with your wallets. Search out the companies that are acting on this. But also  there are other businesses already acting. I mentioned renewable energy. You go to Google or Lego  they're going     percent renewable too  in the same way that we are. On having really good sustainability strategies  there are companies like Nike  Patagonia  Timberland  Marks   Spencer. But I don't think any of those businesses would say they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't. We'll make mistakes going forward  but it's about setting a clear direction  being transparent  having a dialogue with the right partners  and choosing to lead on the issues that really count. So if you're a business leader  if you're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model  I'd urge you to do so. And together  we can help create a sustainable world  and  if we get it right  we can make sustainability affordable for the many people  not a luxury for the few. Thank you. Africa is booming. Per capita incomes since the year      have doubled  and this boom is impacting on everyone. Life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade. That means if an African child is born today  rather than three days ago  they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan. It's that quick. And HIV infection rates are down    percent          less people a year are getting HIV in sub Saharan Africa. The battle against malaria is being won  with deaths from malaria down    percent  according to the latest World Bank data. And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that. This shouldn't surprise us  because actually  everybody grows. If you go back to Imperial Rome in the Year   A.D.  there was admittedly about       years where there wasn't an awful lot of growth. But then the people that the Romans would have called Scottish barbarians  my ancestors  were actually part of the Industrial Revolution  and in the   th century  growth began to accelerate  and you saw that get quicker and quicker  and it's been impacting everyone. It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore or the tundra of northern Finland. Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when the inevitable happens. Among the reasons I think it's happening right now is the quality of the leadership across Africa. I think most of us would agree that in the     s  the greatest politician in the world was African  but I'm meeting brilliant people across the continent the entire time  and they're doing the reforms which have transformed the economic situation for their countries. And the West is engaging with that. The West has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub Saharan debt from about    percent of GDP down to about   . At the same time  our debt level's gone up to     and we're all feeling slightly miserable as a result. Politics gets weaker when debt is high. When public sector debt is low  governments don't have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe. And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good. The private sector as well. Again  in the West  we have private sector debt of     percent of GDP in Spain  the U.K.  and the U.S. That's an awful lot of debt. Africa  many African countries  are sitting at    to    percent of GDP. If there's any continent that can do what China has done    China's at about     percent of GDP on that chart    if anyone can do what China has done in the last    years  it'll be Africa in the next   . So they've got great government finances  great private sector debt. Does anyone recognize this  In fact  they do. Foreign direct investment has poured into Africa in the last    years. Back in the '  s  no one touched the continent with a barge pole. And this investment is actually Western led. We hear a lot about China  and they do lend a lot of money  but    percent of the FDI in the last couple of years has come from Europe  America  Australia  Canada. Ten percent's come from India. And they're investing in energy. Africa produces    million barrels a day of oil now. It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia. And they're investing in telecoms  shopping malls. And this very encouraging story  I think  is partly demographic led. And it's not just about African demographics. I'm showing you the number of     to    year olds in various parts of the world  and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second. Ten years ago  say you're Foxconn setting up an iPhone factory  by chance. You might choose China  which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line  where there's     million young people  and every year until      that's getting bigger. Which means you're going to have new guys knocking on the door saying   Give us a job   and   I don't need a big pay rise  just please give me a job.  Now  that's completely changed now. This decade  we're going to see a     to    percent fall in the number of     to    year olds in China. So where do you set up your new factory  You look at South Asia  and people are. They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh  and they're also looking at Africa. And they're looking at Africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young Africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade out to     . Now  there's a problem with lots of young people coming into any market  particularly when they're young men. A bit dangerous  sometimes. I think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic  If you look at the red line here  what you're going to see is that in       just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub Saharan Africa. Would you set up a factory in sub Sahara in the mid     s  Nobody else did. They chose instead Turkey and Mexico to set up the textiles factories  because their education levels were    to    percent. Today  sub Sahara is at the levels that Turkey and Mexico were at in     . They will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth. So what's Africa looking like today  This is how I look at Africa. It's a bit odd  because I'm an economist. Each little box is about a billion dollars  and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention to Nigeria sitting there in the middle. South Africa is playing a role. But when I'm thinking about the future  I'm actually most interested in Central  Western and Southern Africa. If I look at Africa by population  East Africa stands out as so much potential. And I'm showing you something else with these maps. I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy. Fragile democracies is the beige color. Strong democracies are the orange color. And what you'll see here is that most Africans are now living in democracies. Why does that matter  Because what people want is what politicians try  they don't always succeed  but they try and deliver. And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on. In Ghana in the elections  in December       the battle between the two candidates was over education. One guy offered free secondary school education to all  not just    percent. The other guy had to say  I'm going to build    new schools. He won by a margin. So democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education. Education is helping growth and investment  and that's giving budget revenues  which is giving governments more money  which is helping growth through education. It's a positive  virtuous circle. But I get asked this question  and this particular question makes me quite sad  It's   But what about corruption  How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption   And what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth. When you're poor  corruption is not your biggest priority. And the countries on the right hand side  you'll see the per capita GDP  basically every country with a per capita GDP of  say  less than       dollars  has got a corruption score of roughly  what's that  about three  Three out of   . That's not good. Every poor country is corrupt. Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt. How do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption  You see the middle class grow. And the way to do that is to invest  not to say I'm not investing in that continent because there's too much corruption. Now  I don't want to be an apologist for corruption. I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe    not in Africa  actually. But what I'm saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing. Now I'm going to let you in on a little not so secret. Economists aren't great at forecasting. Because the question really is  what happens next  And if you go back to the year       what you'll find is The Economist had a very famous cover   The Hopeless Continent   and what they'd done is they'd looked at growth in Africa over the previous    years    two percent    and they said  what's going to happen in the next    years  They assumed two percent  and that made it a pretty hopeless story  because population growth was two and a half. People got poorer in Africa in the     s. Now       The Economist has a new cover  and what does that new cover show  That new cover shows  well  Africa rising  because the growth over the last    years has been about five and a half percent. I would like to see if you can all now become economists  because if growth for the last    years has been five and a half percent  what do you think the IMF is forecasting for the next five years of growth in Africa  Very good. I think you're secretly saying to your head  probably five and a half percent. You're all economists  and I think  like most economists  wrong. No offense. What I like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what Africa has already done  and it means that jump from       years of nothing to whoof  suddenly shooting through the roof. India is one of those examples. This is Indian growth from      to     . Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second. Actually  for the first    years  the '  s and '  s  India didn't really grow. It grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half. If that's familiar  that's exactly what happened in sub Sahara in the '  s and the '  s. And then something happened in     . Boom  India began to explode. It wasn't a  Hindu rate of growth    democracies can't grow.  Actually India could. And if I lay sub Saharan growth on top of the Indian growth story  it's remarkably similar. Twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub Saharan African growth is slightly better than India. And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this  I'm saying India is    years ahead of Africa  I'm saying developing Asia is    years ahead of India  I can draw out some forecasts for the next    to    years which I think are better than the ones where you're looking backwards. And that tells me this  that Africa is going to go from a    trillion economy today to a     trillion economy by     . Now that's bigger than Europe and America put together in today's money. Life expectancy is going to go up by    years. The population's going to double from one billion to two billion  so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold in the next    years. And when I present this in Africa    Nairobi  Lagos  Accra    I get one question.  Charlie  why are you so pessimistic   And you know what  Actually  I think they've got a point. Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned  yes from the positives in Asia and India  but also the negatives  Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made. Surely  the technologies that we're talking about here this last week  surely some of these can perhaps help Africa grow even faster  And I think here we can play a role. Because technology does let you help. You can go and download some of the great African literature from the Internet now. No  not right now  just    seconds. You can go and buy some of the great tunes. My iPod's full of them. Buy African products. Go on holiday and see for yourself the change that's happening. Invest. Perhaps hire people  give them the skills that they can take back to Africa  and their companies will grow an awful lot faster than most of ours here in the West. And then you and I can help make sure that for Africa  the   st century is their century. Thank you very much. So when I was eight years old  a new girl came to join the class  and she was so impressive  as the new girl always seems to be. She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case  super strong on state capitals  just a great speller. And I just curdled with jealousy that year  until I hatched my devious plan. So one day I stayed a little late after school  a little too late  and I lurked in the girls' bathroom. When the coast was clear  I emerged  crept into the classroom  and took from my teacher's desk the grade book. And then I did it. I fiddled with my rival's grades  just a little  just demoted some of those A's. All of those A's.  Laughter  And I got ready to return the book to the drawer  when hang on  some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too. So  in a frenzy  I corrected everybody's marks  not imaginatively. I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's  just because I was there  you know  might as well. And I am still baffled by my behavior. I don't understand where the idea came from. I don't understand why I felt so great doing it. I felt great. I don't understand why I was never caught. I mean  it should have been so blatantly obvious. I was never caught. But most of all  I am baffled by  why did it bother me so much that this little girl  this tiny little girl  was so good at spelling  Jealousy baffles me. It's so mysterious  and it's so pervasive. We know babies suffer from jealousy. We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone. We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States. And yet  I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill. For that  we have to go to fiction  because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration. In fact  I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy  would we even have literature  Well no faithless Helen  no  Odyssey.  No jealous king  no  Arabian Nights.  No Shakespeare. There goes high school reading lists  because we're losing  Sound and the Fury   we're losing  Gatsby    Sun Also Rises   we're losing  Madame Bovary    Anna K.  No jealousy  no Proust. And now  I mean  I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything  but in the case of jealousy  he kind of does. This year is the centennial of his masterpiece   In Search of Lost Time   and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness  my brand  that we can hope to have.  Laughter  And we think about Proust  we think about the sentimental bits  right  We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep. We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea. We forget how harsh his vision was. We forget how pitiless he is. I mean  these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut. I don't know what cat gut is  but let's assume it's formidable. Let's look at why they go so well together  the novel and jealousy  jealousy and Proust. Is it something as obvious as that jealousy  which boils down into person  desire  impediment  is such a solid narrative foundation  I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone  because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous. When we feel jealous  we tell ourselves a story. We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives  and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. As the teller of the tale and the audience  we know just what details to include  to dig that knife in. Right  Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists  and this is something Proust understood. In the first volume  Swann's Way  the series of books  Swann  one of the main characters  is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed  and suddenly  in the course of a few sentences  and these are Proustian sentences  so they're long as rivers  but in the course of a few sentences  he suddenly recoils and he realizes   Hang on  everything I love about this woman  somebody else would love about this woman. Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure  maybe right about now.  And this is the story he starts to tell himself  and from then on  Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress  he adds to his  collection of instruments in his private torture chamber.  Now Swann and Proust  we have to admit  were notoriously jealous. You know  Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him. But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. Right  Jealousy is exhausting. It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed. And what does jealousy like  Jealousy likes information. Jealousy likes details. Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair  the cute little pencil case. Jealousy likes photos. That's why Instagram is such a hit.  Laughter  Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy. When Swann is in his jealous throes  and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants  he defends these behaviors. He says   You know  look  I know you think this is repugnant  but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument.  He says   They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value.  Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd  but it is  at its crux  a quest for knowledge  a quest for truth  painful truth  and actually  where Proust is concerned  the more painful the truth  the better. Grief  humiliation  loss  These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust. He says   A woman whom we need  who makes us suffer  elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us.  Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women  No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves. And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way  Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement  Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity  Freud would write about this later. One day  Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him. And Freud says  it's something strange about this guy  because he's not looking at what his wife is doing. Because she's blameless  everybody knows it. The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing  unintentional behaviors. Is she smiling too brightly here  or did she accidentally brush up against a man there   Freud  says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious. The novel is very good on this point. The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy. In fact  the more intensely jealous we are  the more we become residents of fantasy. And this is why  I think  jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. Now I'm thinking of myself at eight  I concede  but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news. A    year old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile  hideous messages to herself for a year. For a year. A year. And she was trying to frame her ex boyfriend's new girlfriend  and I have to confess when I heard this  I just reacted with admiration. Because  I mean  let's be real. What immense  if misplaced  creativity. Right  This is something from a novel. This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel. Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine. She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters. She's the author of  Strangers on a Train  and  The Talented Mr. Ripley   books that are all about how jealousy  it muddles our minds  and once we're in the sphere  in that realm of jealousy  the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant. Take Tom Ripley  her most famous character. Now  Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had  and you're under the floorboards  he's answering to your name  he's wearing your rings  emptying your bank account. That's one way to go. But what do we do  We can't go the Tom Ripley route. I can't give the world D's  as much as I would really like to  some days. And it's a pity  because we live in envious times. We live in jealous times. I mean  we're all good citizens of social media  aren't we  where the currency is envy  Does the novel show us a way out  I'm not sure. So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure  when they are in possession of a mystery. Let's go to    B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes. When people think of Holmes  they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty  right  this criminal mastermind. But I've always preferred  Inspector  Lestrade  who is the rat faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately  needs Holmes' genius  but resents him. Oh  it's so familiar to me. So Lestrade needs his help  resents him  and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. But as they work together  something starts to change  and finally in  The Adventure of the Six Napoleons   once Holmes comes in  dazzles everybody with his solution  Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says   We're not jealous of you  Mr. Holmes. We're proud of you.  And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand. It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries  and I find it very moving  this little scene  but it's also mysterious  right  It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry  not emotion. You know  one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. The next minute they're on the same side. Suddenly  Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented. Could it be so simple though  What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry  just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another  Well  maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence. We could align ourselves with it. But I like contingency plans. So while we wait for that to happen  let us remember that we have fiction for consolation. Fiction alone demystifies jealousy. Fiction alone domesticates it  invites it to the table. And look who it gathers  sweet Lestrade  terrifying Tom Ripley  crazy Swann  Marcel Proust himself. We are in excellent company. Thank you. So last year  on the Fourth of July  experiments at the Large Hadron Collider discovered the Higgs boson. It was a historical day. There's no doubt that from now on  the Fourth of July will be remembered not as the day of the Declaration of Independence  but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson. Well  at least  here at CERN. But for me  the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise. In the eye of a theoretical physicist  the Higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass  but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution. Too many questions are left unanswered. The Higgs boson does not share the beauty  the symmetry  the elegance  of the rest of the elementary particle world. For this reason  the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the Higgs boson could not be the full story. We were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the Higgs boson. Instead  so far  the measurements coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena. Of course  the verdict is not definitive. In       the LHC will almost double the energy of the colliding protons  and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world  and we will certainly learn much more. But for the moment  since we have found no evidence for new phenomena  let us suppose that the particles that we know today  including the Higgs boson  are the only elementary particles in nature  even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far. Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us. We will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe  and to explain my point  let me first tell you what the Higgs is about  and to do so  we have to go back to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang. And according to the Higgs theory  at that instant  a dramatic event took place in the universe. Space time underwent a phase transition. It was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees. But in our case  the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside the material  but is about a change of the very fabric of space time. During this phase transition  empty space became filled with a substance that we now call Higgs field. And this substance may seem invisible to us  but it has a physical reality. It surrounds us all the time  just like the air we breathe in this room. And some elementary particles interact with this substance  gaining energy in the process. And this intrinsic energy is what we call the mass of a particle  and by discovering the Higgs boson  the LHC has conclusively proved that this substance is real  because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of. And this  in a nutshell  is the essence of the Higgs story. But this story is far more interesting than that. By studying the Higgs theory  theoretical physicists discovered  not through an experiment but with the power of mathematics  that the Higgs field does not necessarily exist only in the form that we observe today. Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid  so the Higgs field  the substance that fills all space time  could exist in two states. Besides the known Higgs state  there could be a second state in which the Higgs field is billions and billions times denser than what we observe today  and the mere existence of another state of the Higgs field poses a potential problem. This is because  according to the laws of quantum mechanics  it is possible to have transitions between two states  even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states  and the phenomenon is called  quite appropriately  quantum tunneling. Because of quantum tunneling  I could disappear from this room and reappear in the next room  practically penetrating the wall. But don't expect me to actually perform the trick in front of your eyes  because the probability for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small. You would have to wait a really long time before it happens  but believe me  quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon  and it has been observed in many systems. For instance  the tunnel diode  a component used in electronics  works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling. But let's go back to the Higgs field. If the ultra dense Higgs state existed  then  because of quantum tunneling  a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time  and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water. Bubbles of vapor form inside the water  then they expand  turning liquid into gas. In the same way  a bubble of the ultra dense Higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling. The bubble would then expand at the speed of light  invading all space  and turning the Higgs field from the familiar state into a new state. Is this a problem  Yes  it's a big a problem. We may not realize it in ordinary life  but the intensity of the Higgs field is critical for the structure of matter. If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense  we would see atoms shrinking  neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei  nuclei disintegrating  and hydrogen would be the only possible chemical element in the universe. And the Higgs field  in the ultra dense Higgs state  is not just a few times more intense than today  but billions of times  and if space time were filled by this Higgs state  all atomic matter would collapse. No molecular structures would be possible  no life. So  I wonder  is it possible that in the future  the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and  through quantum tunneling  will be transformed into this nasty  ultra dense state  In other words  I ask myself  what is the fate of the Higgs field in our universe  And the crucial ingredient necessary to answer this question is the Higgs boson mass. And experiments at the LHC found that the mass of the Higgs boson is about     GeV. This is tiny when expressed in familiar units  because it's equal to something like    to the minus    grams  but it is large in particle physics units  because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a DNA constituent. So armed with this information from the LHC  together with some colleagues here at CERN  we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra dense Higgs state  and we found a very intriguing result. Our calculations showed that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass is very special. It has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation. The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse. So according to these calculations  we are like campers who accidentally set their tent at the edge of a cliff. And eventually  the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself. So is this how humanity is going to disappear  I don't think so. Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the Higgs field is not likely to occur in the next    to the     years  and this is a very long time. It's even longer than the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government. Even so  we will be long gone by then. In about five billion years  our sun will become a red giant  as large as the Earth's orbit  and our Earth will be kaput  and in a thousand billion years  if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate  you will not even be able to see as far as your toes  because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light. So it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse. But the reason why I am interested in the transition of the Higgs field is because I want to address the question  why is the Higgs boson mass so special  Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition  Theoretical physicists always ask  why  questions. More than how a phenomenon works  theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works. We think that this these  why  questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature. And indeed  a possible answer to my question opens up new universes  literally. It has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles  and each bubble is a different universe with different fundamental constants and different physical laws. And in this context  you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass. Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse. It would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach. In principle  you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach  and yet  the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around        degrees. And the reason is simple  because wind builds up the sand  gravity makes it fall. As a result  the vast majority of sand dunes have slope angles around the critical value  near to collapse. And something similar could happen for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse. In the majority of bubble universes  the Higgs mass could be around the critical value  near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field  because of two competing effects  just as in the case of sand. My story does not have an end  because we still don't know the end of the story. This is science in progress  and to solve the mystery  we need more data  and hopefully  the LHC will soon add new clues to this story. Just one number  the Higgs boson mass  and yet  out of this number we learn so much. I started from a hypothesis  that the known particles are all there is in the universe  even beyond the domain explored so far. From this  we discovered that the Higgs field that permeates space time may be standing on a knife edge  ready for cosmic collapse  and we discovered that this may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach  the multiverse. But I don't know if my hypothesis is right. That's how physics works  A single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley. But whichever it turns out to be  there is one thing I'm sure of  The journey will be full of surprises. Thank you. My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions. Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this. Both projects are in emerging countries  one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia. And also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture. The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa. And this is the type of building we were shown as an example  to my team and myself  of what we had to design. At first  the first thing I thought was  I want to run away. After seeing a few of these buildings    there are many in the city    we realized that they have three very big points. First  these buildings  they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things. Second  they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside  and then you need a lot of cooling. In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from    to    degrees the whole year. And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia. It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions. Also during our first visit to Ethiopia  I was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open air structure where thousands of people  they go and buy things every day from small vendors. And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity. So I thought  this is what I really want to design  not a shopping mall. But the question was how we could do a multistory  contemporary building with these principles. The next challenge was when we looked at the site  that is  in a really growing area of the city  where most of these buildings that you see in the image  they were not there. And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters. So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets  putting all the entrances of the building. And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open air space in the building that self protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain. And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops  that change in each floor because of the shape of the void. I also thought  how to close the building  And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions. And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in  and also the light  but in a filtered way. And then the inspiration came from these beautiful  patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses. That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade. And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building. And this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night. With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like   This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.  But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell. And also that the idea of the facade was much  much cheaper  not only because of the material compared with the glass  but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore. So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project. And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day. So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof. And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis. And these porches on the roof  all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside. Hopefully by the beginning of next year  because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction. The second example is a master plan of       apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis. And for doing such a big project  the biggest project I've ever designed  I really needed to understand the city of Tunis  but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture. During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this       year old structure that used to be closed by a wall  opened by twelve different gates  connected by almost straight lines. When I went to the site  the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets  creating    initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards. On top of that  we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines  and this modified this initial pattern. And the last operation was to think about the cell  the small cell of the project  like the apartment  as an essential part of the master plan. And for that I thought  what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment  And it's north south  because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation. So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction. And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city. It has these blocks with courtyards  and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians. And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor. And it also reinforces this idea of the gates. The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the courtyards there are the different facilities  such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by  a series of commercial  spaces  that bring activity to the ground floor. The roof  which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction. And it's where all the neighbors  they can go up and socialize  and do activities such as having a two kilometer run in the morning  jumping from one building to another. These two examples  they have a common approach in the design process. And also  they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing. In these cities  the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow. For this reason  I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people. Thank you very much. Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies  the really cool companies  the innovative ones  the creative  new economy type companies    Apple  Google  Facebook    are coming out of one particular country  the United States of America  Usually when I say this  someone says   Spotify  That's Europe.  But  yeah. It has not had the impact that these other companies have had. Now what I do is I'm an economist  and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company  the industry and the nation  and I work with policymakers worldwide  especially in the European Commission  but recently also in interesting places like China  and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues  Where are the European Googles  What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model  which they understand is different from this old economy growth model  And what is interesting is that often  even if we're in the   st century  we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state. It's talked about in these modern ways  but the idea is that somehow  behind places like Silicon Valley  the secret have been different types of market making mechanisms  the private initiative  whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that's actually able to provide that high risk finance to these innovative companies  the gazelles as we often call them  which traditional banks are scared of  or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions  their products  to the market and actually get over this really scary Death Valley period in which many companies instead fail. But what really interests me  especially nowadays and because of what's happening politically around the world  is the language that's used  the narrative  the discourse  the images  the actual words. So we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it's able to think out of the box. They are more dynamic. Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech to the      graduating class at Stanford  where he said to be innovative  you've got to stay hungry  stay foolish. Right  So these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys  right  And in places like Europe  it might be more equitable  we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S.  but the problem is this damn public sector. It's a bit too big  and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could. And even really respectable newspapers  some that I'm actually subscribed to  the words they use are  you know  the state as this Leviathan. Right  This monster with big tentacles. They're very explicit in these editorials. They say   You know  the state  it's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution  but you know what  what is the next big revolution going to be after the Internet  We all hope it might be something green  or all of this nanotech stuff  and in order for that stuff to happen   they say    this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution    they say   the state  just stick to the basics  right  Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools. Even fund the basic research  because this is popularly recognized  in fact  as a big public good which private companies don't want to invest in  do that  but you know what  Leave the rest to the revolutionaries.  Those colorful  out of the box kind of thinkers. They're often called garage tinkerers  because some of them actually did some things in garages  even though that's partly a myth. And so what I want to do with you in  oh God  only    minutes  is to really think again this juxtaposition  because it actually has massive  massive implications beyond innovation policy  which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers. It has huge implications  even with this whole notion that we have on where  when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which  of course  as we know  are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition. Right  I mean  the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum  or something. So these kind of words are constantly  these juxtapositions come up everywhere  not just with innovation policy. And so to think again  there's no reason that you should believe me  so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on  but you might want to take it out  your iPhone. Ask who actually funded the really cool  revolutionary thinking out of the box things in the iPhone. What actually makes your phone a smartphone  basically  instead of a stupid phone  So the Internet  which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world  GPS  where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world  the touchscreen display  which makes it also a really easy to use phone for anybody. These are the very smart  revolutionary bits about the iPhone  and they're all government funded. And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA  U.S. Department of Defense. GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program. Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA. The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware. Now  you might be thinking   Well  she's just said the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot   but what's really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department. So the pharmaceutical industry  which I am personally very interested in because I've actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth  is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non revolutionary bits  because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental. So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs  whereas the slight variations of existing drugs    Viagra  different color  different dosage    are the less revolutionary ones. And it turns out that a full    percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring  Kafka ian public sector labs. This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation. They do. They spend on the marketing part. They spend on the D part of R D. They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock  which is quite problematic. In fact  companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on R D  but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day I'd be fascinated to tell you about. Now  what's interesting in all of this is the state  in all these examples  was doing so much more than just fixing market failures. It was actually shaping and creating markets. It was funding not only the basic research  which again is a typical public good  but even the applied research. It was even  God forbid  being a venture capitalist. So these SBIR and SDTR programs  which give small companies early stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital  but also have become increasingly important. Why  Because  as many of us know  V.C. is actually quite short term. They want their returns in three to five years. Innovation takes a much longer time than that     to    years. And so this whole notion    I mean  this is the point  right  Who's actually funding the hard stuff  Of course  it's not just the state. The private sector does a lot. But the narrative that we've always been told is the state is important for the basics  but not really providing that sort of high risk  revolutionary thinking out of the box. In all these sectors  from funding the Internet to doing the spending  but also the envisioning  the strategic vision  for these investments  it was actually coming within the state. The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this  because the word itself  nanotechnology  came from within government. And so there's huge implications of this. First of all  of course I'm not someone  this old fashioned person  market versus state. What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public private partnerships. But the point is  by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually    pffff    a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan  I think we've actually really stunted the possibility to build these public private partnerships in a really dynamic way. Even the words that we often use to justify the  P  part  the public part    well  they're both P's    with public private partnerships is in terms of de risking. What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you  and there's many more  which myself and other colleagues have been looking at  is doing much more than de risking. It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on. It's actually been the one thinking out of the box. But also  I'm sure you all have had experience with local  regional  national governments  and you're kind of like   You know what  that Kafka ian bureaucrat  I've met him.  That whole juxtaposition thing  it's kind of there. Well  there's a self fulfilling prophecy. By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant  boring  it's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way. So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations. DARPA  that funded the Internet and Siri  actually thought really hard about this  how to welcome failure  because you will fail. You will fail when you innovative. One out of    experiments has any success. And the V.C. guys know this  and they're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success. And this brings me  actually  probably  to the biggest implication  and this has huge implications beyond innovation. If the state is more than just a market fixer  if it actually is a market shaper  and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk  what happened to the reward  We all know  if you've ever taken a finance course  the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk reward relationship  and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait  to actually invest in stocks  because they're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds  that whole risk reward thing. Well  where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet  The Internet was crazy. It really was. I mean  the probability of failure was massive. You had to be completely nuts to do it  and luckily  they were. Now  we don't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk taker. And the problem is that economists often think  well  there is a reward back to the state. It's tax. You know  the companies will pay tax  the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism. Well  unfortunately  that's not true. Okay  it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad. Globalization  and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic. Let the jobs go where they have to go  perhaps. I mean  one can take a position on that. But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state    Apple's a great example. They even got the first    well  not the first  but         dollars actually went to Apple  the company  through this SBIC program  which predated the SBIR program  as well as  as I said before  all the technologies behind the iPhone. And yet we know they legally  as many other companies  pay very little tax back. So what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return generating mechanism that's much more direct than tax. Why not  It could happen perhaps through equity. This  by the way  in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically  countries like Finland in Scandinavia  but also in China and Brazil  they're retaining equity in these investments. Sitra funded Nokia  kept equity  made a lot of money  it's a public funding agency in Finland  which then funded the next round of Nokias. The Brazilian Development Bank  which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology  they just announced a     billion program for the future on this  is retaining equity in these investments. So to put it provocatively  had the U.S. government thought about this  and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund  you can bet that  you know  if even just .   percent of the profits from what the Internet produced had come back to that innovation fund  there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology. Instead  many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained. But perhaps even more important  we heard before about the one percent  the    percent. If the state is thought about in this more strategic way  as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism  because that's what we're talking about  right  Who are the different players in creating value in the economy  and is the state's role  has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player  If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back  it might just be that in the next round  and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green  that that period of growth will not only be smart  innovation led  not only green  but also more inclusive  so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth  because they have not. Thank you. I'm going to start by asking you a question  Is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem  Okay  so most of you are. I think we can all agree it's a serious issue. Nobody wants to drink blue algae contaminated water  or swim in a blue algae infested lake. Right  I hope you won't be disappointed  but today  I won't be talking about blue algae. Instead  I'll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue  which I will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis. Why have I chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today  For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it. And by the end of my presentation  I hope that the general public will be more aware of this crisis and this issue. Now  the problem is that if I ask  why do we find ourselves in this situation with blue algae  The answer is that it comes from how we farm. We use fertilizers in our farming  chemical fertilizers. Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture  Basically  to help plants grow and to produce a better yield. The issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem that is without precedent. Before going further  let me give you a crash course in plant biology. So  what does a plant need in order to grow  A plant  quite simply  needs light  it needs CO   but even more importantly  it needs nutrients  which it draws from the soil. Several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements  phosphorus  nitrogen and calcium. So  the plant s roots will extract these resources. Today I'll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus. Why phosphorus in particular  Because it is the most problematic chemical element. By the end of my presentation  you will have seen what these problems are  and where we are today. Phosphorus is a chemical element that is essential to life. This is a very important point. I d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is. Phosphorus is a key component in several molecules  in many of our molecules of life. Experts in the field will know that cellular communication is phosphorus based    phosphorylation  dephosphorylation. Cell membranes are phosphorus based  These are called phospholipids. The energy in all living things  ATP  is phosphorus based. And more importantly still  phosphorus is a key component of DNA  something everyone is familiar with  and which is shown in this image. DNA is our genetic heritage. It is extremely important  and once again  phosphorus is a key player. Now  where do we find this phosphorus  As humans  where do we find it  As I explained earlier  plants extract phosphorus from the soil  through water. So  we humans get it from the things we eat  plants  vegetables  fruits  and also from eggs  meat and milk. It s true that some humans eat better than others. Some are happier than others. And now  looking at this picture  which speaks for itself  we see modern agriculture  which I also refer to as intensive agriculture. Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers. Without them  we would not manage to produce enough to feed the world's population. Speaking of humans  there are currently   billion of us on Earth. In less than    years  there will be   billion of us. And the question is a simple one  Do we have enough phosphorus to feed our future generations  So  in order to understand these issues  where do we find our phosphorus  Let me explain. But first  let s just suppose that we are using     percent of a given dose of phosphorus. Only    percent of this     percent goes to the plant. Eighty five percent is lost. It goes into the soil  ending its journey in the lakes  resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus  which leads to the blue algae problem. So  you ll see there s a problem here  something that is illogical. A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used  but only    percent goes to the plant. You re going to tell me it s wasteful. Yes  it is. What is worse is that it is very expensive. Nobody wants to throw their money out the window  but unfortunately that's what is happening here. Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost. Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus. And because in order to get    percent of it to the plant  all the rest is lost  we have to add more and more. Now  where will we get this phosphorus from  Basically  we get it out of mines. This is the cover of an extraordinary article published in Nature in       which really launched the discussion about the phosphorus crisis. Phosphorus  a nutrient essential to life  which is becoming increasingly scarce  yet nobody is talking about it. And everyone agrees  Politicians and scientists are in agreement that we are headed for a phosphorus crisis. What you are seeing here is an open pit mine in the U.S.  and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine  if you look in the top right hand corner  the little crane you can see  that is a giant crane. So that really puts it into perspective. So  we get phosphorus from mines. And if I make a comparison with oil  there s an oil crisis  we talk about it  we talk about global warming  yet we never mention the phosphorus crisis. To come back to the oil problem  oil is something we can replace. We can use biofuels  or solar power  or hydropower  but phosphorus is an essential element  indispensable to life  and we can t replace it. What is the current state of the world's phosphorus reserves  This graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today. The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves. In       we ll reach the peak. By the end of this century  it will all be gone. The dotted line shows where we are today. As you can see  they meet in       I ll be retired by then. But we are indeed heading for a major crisis  and I d like people to become aware of this problem. Do we have a solution  What are we to do  We are faced with a paradox. Less and less phosphorus will be available. By      there will be   billion of us  and according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization  we will need to produce twice as much food in      than we do today. So  we will have less phosphorus  but we'll need to produce more food. What should we do  It truly is a paradoxical situation. Do we have a solution  or an alternative which will allow us to optimize phosphorus use  Remember that    percent is destined to be lost. The solution I'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time  even before plants existed on Earth  and it's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious  very simple  and yet also extremely complex. I've been fascinated by this little mushroom for over    years now. It has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research. This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots. By symbiosis  I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza. This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza. You re looking at the root of wheat  one of the world s most important plants. Normally  a root will find phosphorus all by itself. It will go in search of phosphorus  but only within the one millimeter which surrounds it. Beyond one millimeter  the root is ineffective. It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus. Now  imagine this tiny  microscopic mushroom. It grows much faster  and is much better designed to seek out phosphorus. It can go beyond the root s one millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus. I haven t invented anything at all  it's a biotechnology that has existed for     million years. And over time  this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tiniest trace of phosphorus  and to put it to use  to make it available to the plant. What you re seeing here  in the real world  is a carrot root  and the mushroom with its very fine filaments. Looking closer  we can see that this mushroom is very gentle in its penetration. It will proliferate between the root's cells  eventually penetrating a cell and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure  which will considerably increase the exchange interface between the plant and the mushroom. And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur. It s a win win trade  I give you phosphorus  and you feed me. True symbiosis. Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram I used earlier. And instead of using a     percent dose  I m going to reduce it to    percent. You ll see that of this    percent  most will benefit the plant  more than    percent. A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil. That's completely natural. What's more is that in certain cases  we don't even need to add phosphorus. If you recall the graphs I showed you earlier     percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil  and the plants are unable to access it. Even though it is present in the soil  it is in insoluble form. The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms. The mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form and making it available for the plant to use. To further support my argument  here is a picture that speaks for itself. These are trials in a field of sorghum. On the left side  you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture  with a     percent phosphorus dose. On the other side  the dose was reduced to    percent  and just look at the yield. With only a half dose  we achieved a better yield. This is to show you that this method works. And in some cases  in Cuba  Mexico and India  the dose can be reduced to    percent  and in several other cases  there's no need to add any phosphorus at all  because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil. This is an example of soy production in Canada. Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other. And here  where blue indicates a better yield  and yellow a weaker yield. The black rectangle is the plot from which the mycorrhiza was added. In other words  as I already said  I have invented nothing. Mycorrhiza has existed for     million years  and it has even helped modern day plant species to diversify. So  this it isn't something that is still undergoing lab tests. Mycorrhiza exists  it works  it's produced at an industrial scale and commercialized worldwide. The problem is that people are not aware of it. People like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem. We have a technology that works  and one that  if used correctly  will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world's phosphorus reserves. In conclusion  I am a scientist and a dreamer. I'm passionate about this topic. So if you were to ask me what my retirement dream is  which will be at the moment we reach that phosphorus peak  it would be that we use one label   Made with mycorrhiza   and that my children and grandchildren buy products bearing that label too. Thank you for your attention. I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy  and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me. Half the city was dark because of a power cut  and I was living on the dark side. Now  Maui was terrified of the dark  so I had to carry him up the stairs  actually down the stairs first  for his walk  and then bring him back up. I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day. And through all of this  I had to hold a torch between my teeth. The stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread. For a shower  I walked    blocks to a branch of my gym. But these were not the major preoccupations of my day. It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices. I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points. I wasn't the only one. Even in the rain  people stood between Madison and  th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street. Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology  and yet here we were  obsessed about being wired. I think there's nothing like a crisis to tell you what's really important and what's not  and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter. The self as we once knew it no longer exists  and I think that an abstract  digital universe has become a part of our identity  and I want to talk to you about what I think that means. I'm a novelist  and I'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common. They're both stories  interpretations. You and I can experience things without a story. We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless. But the larger sense that we have of our lives  the slightly more abstract one  is indirect. Our story of our life is based on direct experience  but it's embellished. A novel needs scene after scene to build  and the story of our life needs an arc as well. It needs months and years. Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters. But the story is not about these chapters. It's the whole book. It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness  the victories and the disappointments  but it's because how because of these  and sometimes  more importantly  in spite of these  we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves. Our story  therefore  needs two dimensions of time  a long arc of time that is our lifespan  and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment. Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment  but the one that narrates needs several moments  a whole sequence of them  and that's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time. Now  the flow of time is embedded in everything  in the erosion of a grain of sand  in the budding of a little bud into a rose. Without it  we would have no music. Our own emotions and state of mind often encode time  regret or nostalgia about the past  hope or dread about the future. I think that technology has altered that flow of time. The overall time that we have for our narrative  our lifespan  has been increasing  but the smallest measure  the moment  has shrunk. It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time  and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world  and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers. All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen. Science can do things with and in a picosecond  but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second. You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow  to the sun  the moon and the seasons  and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past  the present and the future to see things for what they are  to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations. We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect  not just in the material world  but in our own intentions and our motivations. What happens when that arrow goes awry  What happens when time warps  So many of us today have the sensation that time's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once. This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one. We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time. Far away over there is now here. News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether I'm in New York or New Delhi. And that's not all. Your last job  your dinner reservations from last year  your former friends  lie on a flat plain with today's friends  because the Internet also archives  and it warps the past. With no distinction left between the past  the present and the future  and the here or there  we are left with this moment everywhere  this moment that I'll call the digital now. Just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now  This digital now is not the present  because it's always a few seconds ahead  with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones. This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book. This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state. Its focus  instead  is to distract us at every turn on the road. Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else. Are you reading an interview by an author  Why not buy his book  Tweet it. Share it. Like it. Find other books exactly like his. Find other people reading those books. Travel can be liberating  but when it is incessant  we become permanent exiles without repose. Choice is freedom  but not when it's constantly for its own sake. Not just is the digital now far from the present  but it's in direct competition with it  and this is because not just am I absent from it  but so are you. Not just are we absent from it  but so is everyone else. And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror. I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night  shop for Parisian macarons  and leave video messages that get picked up later. At all times  I can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you  while I sustain the illusion that I'm tapped into you in real time. Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter. There were those with power and water  and those without. There are those who went back to their lives  and those who are still displaced after so many months. For some reason  technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does  and then  like an ironic slap in the face  it makes it true. For example  it's said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets. Now if this rift  which is already so great in many parts of the world  between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology  isn't somehow bridged  there will be ruptures between the digital and the real. For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it  the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous. How does one live inside distraction  We might think that those younger than us  those who are born into this  will adapt more naturally. Possibly  but I remember my childhood. I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me. Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube  and Vienna had a Spanish riding school. If I were a child today  I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks  but it really wouldn't be the same  because much later  I went to Vienna  and I went to the Spanish riding school  and I could feel my grandfather right beside me. Night after night  he took me up on the terrace  on his shoulders  and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me. And even here  when I look at the Great Bear  I get back that feeling of being a child  hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder  and I can get back that feeling of being a child again. What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact  but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact. Time warping technology challenges our deepest core  because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget  even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable. We want to clutch  and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments. They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them. By archiving everything  we think that we can store it  but time is not data. It cannot be stored. You and I know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment. It might have happened while we were playing an instrument  or looking into the eyes of someone we've known for a very long time. At such moments  our selves are complete. The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one. The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future. The present joins a flow of time from before and after. I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother. I wanted to learn to skip  and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it. I wanted to learn to cook  and she kept me in the kitchen  cutting  cubing and chopping for a whole month. My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take  that time can't be fought  and because it will pass and it will move  we owe the present moment our full attention. Attention is time. One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention  and definitely from my grandmother  love and attention were one and the same thing. The digital world cannibalizes time  and in doing so  I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves. It threatens the flow of love. But we don't need to let it. We can choose otherwise. We've seen again and again just how creative technology can be  and in our lives and in our actions  we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it. We can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time. We can choose to take time back. Thank you. Three years ago  I was standing about a hundred yards from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four. My Geiger counter dosimeter  which measures radiation  was going berserk  and the closer I got  the more frenetic it became  and frantic. My God. I was there covering the   th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident  as you can see by the look on my face  reluctantly so  but with good reason  because the nuclear fire that burned for    days back in      released     times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima  and the sarcophagus  which is the covering over reactor number four  which was hastily built    years ago  now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation. So I was filming. I just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast. But then  I looked into the distance  and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse  and I'm thinking  who could be living here  I mean  after all  Chernobyl's soil  water and air  are among the most highly contaminated on Earth  and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone  or dead zone  and it's a nuclear police state  complete with border guards. You have to have dosimeter at all times  clicking away  you have to have a government minder  and there's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring. The point being  no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone. But they are. It turns out an unlikely community of some     people are living inside the zone. They're called self settlers. And almost all of them are women  the men having shorter lifespans in part due to overuse of alcohol  cigarettes  if not radiation. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident  but not everybody accepted that fate. The women in the zone  now in their   s and   s  are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and  it would seem  common sense  and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone. They did so illegally. As one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time   Shoot me and dig the grave. Otherwise  I'm going home.  Now why would they return to such deadly soil  I mean  were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them  or both  The thing is  they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently. Now around Chernobyl  there are scattered ghost villages  eerily silent  strangely charming  bucolic  totally contaminated. Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident  but a few are left like this  kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy. Others have a few residents in them  one or two  babushkas   or  babas   which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother. Another village might have six or seven residents. So this is the strange demographic of the zone    isolated alone together. And when I made my way to that piping chimney I'd seen in the distance  I saw Hanna Zavorotnya  and I met her. She's the self declared mayor of Kapavati village  population eight. And she said to me  when I asked her the obvious   Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does.  And you have to remember  these women have survived the worst atrocities of the   th century. Stalin's enforced famines of the     s  the Holodomor  killed millions of Ukrainians  and they faced the Nazis in the '  s  who came through slashing  burning  raping  and in fact many of these women were shipped to Germany as forced labor. So when a couple decades into Soviet rule  Chernobyl happened  they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible. So they returned to their villages and are told they're going to get sick and die soon  but five happy years  their logic goes  is better than    stuck in a high rise on the outskirts of Kiev  separated from the graves of their mothers and fathers and babies  the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon. For them  environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation. It turns out this holds true for other species as well. Wild boar  lynx  moose  they've all returned to the region in force  the very real  very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans. The dead zone  it turns out  is full of life. And there is a kind of heroic resilience  a kind of plain spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at   a.m. pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes  their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka. And there's a patina of simple defiance among them.  They told us our legs would hurt  and they do. So what   I mean  what about their health  The benefits of hardy  physical living  but an environment made toxic by a complicated  little understood enemy  radiation. It's incredibly difficult to parse. Health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught. The World Health Organization puts the number of Chernobyl related deaths at        eventually. Greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands. Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high  and that Chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere  higher levels of anxiety  depression  alcoholism  unemployment and  importantly  disrupted social networks. Now  like many of you  I have moved maybe        times in my life. Home is a transient concept. I have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil. So it's hard for us to understand  but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka  and connection to the land is palpable. And perhaps because these Ukrainian women were schooled under the Soviets and versed in the Russian poets  aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time.  If you leave  you die.   Those who left are worse off now. They are dying of sadness.   Motherland is motherland. I will never leave.  What sounds like faith  soft faith  may actually be fact  because the surprising truth    I mean  there are no studies  but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on Earth for the last    years  have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation  by some estimates up to    years. How could this be  Here's a theory  Could it be that those ties to ancestral soil  the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms  actually affect longevity  The power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative. Home and community are forces that rival even radiation. Now radiation or not  these women are at the end of their lives. In the next decade  the zone's human residents will be gone  and it will revert to a wild  radioactive place  full only of animals and occasionally daring  flummoxed scientists. But the spirit and existence of the babushkas  whose numbers have been halved in the three years I've known them  will leave us with powerful new templates to think about and grapple with  about the relative nature of risk  about transformative connections to home  and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self determination. Thank you. It is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence  and I believe this is true  especially when I hear President Obama often talk about the Korean education system as a benchmark of success. Well  I can tell you that  in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system  also known as pressure cooker  not everyone can do well in that environment. While many people responded in different ways about our education system  my response to the high pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building. Why bows  I'm not quite sure. Perhaps  in the face of constant pressure  my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows. If you think about it  the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times. The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty  where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves. In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact  the government has planted mulberry trees. The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the      Olympics. The area near these walls  which nobody bothers to pay attention to  had been left free from major intervention  and this is where I first found my treasures. As I fell deeper into bow making  I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood. When I went on school field trips  family vacations  or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes  I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag. And they would be somethings like saws  knives  sickles and axes that I covered up with a piece of towel. I would bring the branches home  riding buses and subways  barely holding them in my hands. And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach. Airport security. In the privacy of my room  covered in sawdust  I would saw  trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape. One day  I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire. Where  The rooftop of my apartment building  a place where    families call home. A customer from a department store across from my building called      and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned. I want to take this opportunity to tell my mom  in the audience today  Mom  I was really sorry  and I will be more careful with open fire from now on. My mother had to do a lot of explaining  telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson. I also researched extensively on bows around the world. In that process  I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow. I also worked with many different types of wood  such as maple  yew and mulberry  and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before. The most effective bow for me would be like this. One  Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow. Two  Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight  which means more power. Three  Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage. And four  Horn used to store energy in compression. After fixing  breaking  redesigning  mending  bending and amending  my ideal bow began to take shape  and when it was finally done  it looked like this. I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own. This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum  and see how my bow resembles them. Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention.  Laughter  Through bowmaking  I came in contact with part of my heritage. Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me. You see  I searched far and wide  but never bothered to look close and near. From this realization  I began to take interest in Korean history  which had never inspired me before. In the end  the grass is often greener on my side of the fence  although we don't realize it. Now  I am going to show you how my bow works. And let's see how this one works. This is a bamboo bow  with    pound draw weights. A bow may function in a simple mechanism  but in order to make a good bow  a great amount of sensitivity is required. You need to console and communicate with the wood material. Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being  and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow. I may be an  odd  student with unconventional interests  but I hope I am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you. My ideal world is a place where no one is left behind  where everyone is needed exactly where they are  like the fibers and the tendons in a bow  a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient. The bow resembles me  and I resemble the bow. Now  I am shooting a part of myself to you. No  better yet  a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind. Did it strike you  Thank you. In December of       the city of Apatzing n in the coastal state of Michoac n  in Mexico  awoke to gunfire. For two straight days  the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well organized group  presumably from the local criminal organization  La Familia Michoacana  or the Michoac n family. The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city  so truly like a battlefield. After these two days  and during a particularly intense encounter  it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana  Nazario Moreno  was killed. In response to this terrifying violence  the mayor of Apatzing n decided to call the citizens to a march for peace. The idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state. And so  the day of the scheduled procession  thousands of people showed up. As the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march  his team noticed that  while half of the participants were appropriately dressed in white  and bearing banners asking for peace  the other half was actually marching in support of the criminal organization and its now presumed defunct leader. Shocked  the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime. And so his team stepped aside. The two marches joined together  and they continued their path towards the state capital. This story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society  who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization  is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today  where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete. If you decided to spend    minutes trying to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico by  say  just researching online  the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal  there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others  because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between    and         people have lost their lives in drug related violence. To put these numbers in perspective  this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. It's also shockingly close to the number of people who have died in the Syrian civil war  which is an active civil war. This is happening just south of the border. Now as you're reading  however  you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths  because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless  nameless dead people. Implicitly or explicitly  there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade  and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner  or  most likely  both. And so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died. And so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved. They were part of the bad guys. And that creates some form of comfort for a lot of people. However  while it's easier to think of us  the citizens  the police  the army  as the good guys  and them  the narcos  the carteles  as the bad guys  if you think about it  the latter are only providing a service to the former. Whether we like it or not  the U.S. is the largest market for illegal substances in the world  accounting for more than half of global demand. It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico that is its only route of access from the South  and so  as the former dictator of Mexico  Porfirio Diaz  used to say   Poor Mexico  so far from God and so close to the United States.  The U.N. estimates that there are    million users of illegal drugs in the United States. Using very  very conservative assumptions  this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between    and     billion dollars. If we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part  which we know is false  that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between    billion and    billion dollars. To put these numbers in perspective  Microsoft has yearly revenues of    billion dollars. And it so happens that this is a product that  because of its nature  a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed. And the only way to do this  because it's illegal  is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs. Hence the violence. If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence  you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north. The only thing that the cartels are doing is that they're trying to protect their business. It's not only a multi billion dollar market  but it's also a complex one. For example  the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes  and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized  international production  that by the way needs to have good quality control  because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it. And so that means they need to secure production and quality control in the south  and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels in the markets where these drugs are consumed. I urge you  but only a little bit  because I don't want to get you in trouble  to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want  wherever you want it  whenever you want it  anywhere in the U.S.  and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message  they guarantee delivery of the drug in    minutes or less. Think about this for a second. Think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described. It's very difficult to reconcile this with the image of faceless  ignorant goons that are just shooting each other  very difficult to reconcile. Now  as a business professor  and as any business professor would tell you  an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure  good incentives  a solid identity and good brand management. This leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your    minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico. Because you would quickly realize  and maybe be confused by the fact  that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles. You will hear about Los Zetas  the Knights Templar  which is the new brand for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning  and the Sinaloa Federation. You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press  and this is somewhat true  or mostly true. But this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy. You see  Los Zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals  but was actually created by another criminal organization  the Gulf Cartel  that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico. When that corridor became contested  they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm. So they recruited Los Zetas  an entire unit of elite paratroopers from the Mexican Army. They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel  so much so that at some point  they decided to just take over the operations  which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets  because they grow up. Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason  they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine  but what they did have  and this is again based on their military origin  was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many  many markets very effectively  which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do. And so because they didn't have access to the more profitable drug markets  this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime. That includes kidnapping  prostitution  local drug dealing and human trafficking  including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S. So what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business. They focus most of their recruiting on the army  and they very openly advertise for better salaries  better benefits  better promotion paths  not to mention much better food  than what the army can deliver. The way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality  they let people know that they are there  and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say   I offer you to be the local representative of the Zeta brand.  If they agree    and you don't want to know what happens if they don't    they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town  in exchange for royalties. This kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear  and so Los Zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature  especially when they arrive first in a city  but again  that's just a brand strategy. I'm not saying they're not violent  but what I am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all  when you count  when you do the body count  they're actually all the same. In contrast to them  the Knights Templar that arose in Michoac n emerged in reaction to the incursion of the Zetas into the state of Michoac n. Michoac n is a geographically strategic state because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico  and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico  which then gives you direct access to the U.S. The Knights Templar realized very quickly that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone  and so they developed a strategy as a social enterprise. They brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of Michoac n against organized crime. Their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement  so they invest heavily in providing local services  like dealing with home violence  going after petty criminals  treating addicts  and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are  and  of course  protecting people from other criminal organizations. Now  they kill a lot of people too  but when they kill them  they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them  through newspaper insertions  YouTube videos  and billboards that explain that the people who were killed were killed because they represented a threat not to us  as an organization  of course  but to you  as citizens. And so we're actually here to protect you. They  as social enterprises do  have created a moral and ethical code that they advertise around  and they have very strict recruiting practices. And here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions. They have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade  but the way they do it is  because they control all of Michoac n  and they control the Port of L zaro C rdenas  they leverage that to  for example  trade copper from Michoac n that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from China which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce  and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation that place their products in the U.S. Finally  the Sinaloa Federation. When you read about them  you will often read about them with an undertone of reverence and admiration  because they are the most integrated and the largest of all the Mexican organizations  and  many people argue  the world. They started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the U.S. and the Mexican borders  but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet. They have cultivated a brand of professionalism  business acumen and innovation. They have designed new drug products and new drug processes. They have designed narco tunnels that go across the border  and you can see that these are not  The Shawshank Redemption  types. They have invented narco submarines and boats that are not detected by radar. They have invented drones to transport drugs  catapults  you name it. One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation actually made it to the Forbes list.       Joaquin Guzman Loera  Like any multinational would  they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business  which is high margin drugs like cocaine  heroine  methamphetamines. Like any traditional Latin American multinational would  the way they control their operations is through family ties. When they're entering a new market  they send a family member to supervise it  or  if they're partnering with a new organization  they create a family tie  either through marriages or other types of ties. Like any other multinational would  they protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model  like for example  when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations  they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them  and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this. To further strengthen their brand  they actually have professional P.R. firms that shape how the press talks about them. They have professional videographers on staff. They have incredibly productive ties with the security organizations on both sides of the border. And so  differences aside  what these three organizations share is on the one hand  a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top  but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time. They have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies. And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things. The first one is that drug violence is actually the result of a huge market demand and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee delivery routes. The second thing I want you to remember is that these are sophisticated  coherent organizations that are business organizations  and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach. The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we're more comfortable with this idea of  them   a set of bad guys separated from us  we are actually accomplices to them  either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption. These organizations service  recruit from  and operate within our communities  so necessarily  they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging. And so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have. We see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will. The question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn  blissful  voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young. Thank you. I was about    years old on a camping trip with my dad in the Adirondack Mountains  a wilderness area in the northern part of New York State. It was a beautiful day. The forest was sparkling. The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass  and if it weren't for the path we were following  we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land. We got to our campsite. It was a lean to on a bluff looking over a crystal  beautiful lake  when I discovered a horror. Behind the lean to was a dump  maybe    feet square with rotting apple cores and balled up aluminum foil  and a dead sneaker. And I was astonished  I was very angry  and I was deeply confused. The campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in  who did they think would clean up after them  That question stayed with me  and it simplified a little. Who cleans up after us  However you configure or wherever you place the us  who cleans up after us in Istanbul  Who cleans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London  Here in New York  the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us  to the tune of        tons of garbage and       tons of recyclables every day. I wanted to get to know them as individuals. I wanted to understand who takes the job. What's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden  So I started a research project with them. I rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city  and I learned a lot  but I was still an outsider. I needed to go deeper. So I took the job as a sanitation worker. I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks. And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow. It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education. Everyone asks about the smell. It's there  but it's not as prevalent as you think  and on days when it is really bad  you get used to it rather quickly. The weight takes a long time to get used to. I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week. Then there's the danger. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  sanitation work is one of the    most dangerous occupations in the country  and I learned why. You're in and out of traffic all day  and it's zooming around you. It just wants to get past you  so it's often the motorist is not paying attention. That's really bad for the worker. And then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm. I also learned about the relentlessness of trash. When you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck  you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself. It never stops coming. It's also like a form of respiration or circulation. It must always be in motion. And then there's the stigma. You put on the uniform  and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've blocked traffic with your truck  or you're taking a break too close to their home  or you're drinking coffee in their diner  and they will come and scorn you  and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them. I find the stigma especially ironic  because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city  for three reasons. They are the first guardians of public health. If they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day  it starts to spill out of its containments  and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways. Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us. The economy needs them. If we can't throw out the old stuff  we have no room for the new stuff  so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised. I'm not advocating capitalism  I'm just pointing out their relationship. And then there's what I call our average  necessary quotidian velocity. By that I simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age. We usually don't care for  repair  clean  carry around our coffee cup  our shopping bag  our bottle of water. We use them  we throw them out  we forget about them  because we know there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away. So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane. Their work  I think  is kind of liturgical. They're on the streets every day  rhythmically. They wear a uniform in many cities. You know when to expect them. And their work lets us do our work. They are almost a form of reassurance. The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves  from our own dross  our cast offs  and that flow must be maintained always no matter what. On the day after September    in       I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street  and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every Wednesday. And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days  but I started to cry. And he looked at me  and he just nodded  and he said   We're going to be okay. We're going to be okay.  It was a little while later that I started my research with sanitation  and I met that man again. His name is Paulie  and we worked together many times  and we became good friends. I want to believe that Paulie was right. We are going to be okay. But in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet  we must include and take account of all the costs  including the very real human cost of the labor. And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about  how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling  which is a remarkable success across    years  across the United States and countries around the world  and lift us up to a broader horizon where we're looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources. Municipal waste  what we think of when we talk about garbage  accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream. It's a remarkable statistic. So in the flow of your days  in the flow of your lives  next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you  take a moment to acknowledge them. Take a moment to say thank you. I am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine. My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology focuses on spinal cord injury  which affects more than        people around the world every year  with dramatic consequences for affected individuals  whose life literally shatters in a matter of a handful of seconds. And for me  the Man of Steel  Christopher Reeve  has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people. And this is how I started my own personal journey in this field of research  working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. I still remember this decisive moment. It was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation. Chris addressed us  the scientists and experts   You have to be more pragmatic. When leaving your laboratory tomorrow  I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center to watch injured people fighting to take a step  struggling to maintain their trunk. And when you go home  think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better.  These words  they stuck with me. This was more than    years ago  but ever since  my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury. And my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well controlled experimental conditions. And for this purpose  we placed two hemisections on opposite sides of the body. They completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord  thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis of the leg. But  as observed  after most injuries in humans  there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur. But how to make it happen  Well  the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target. And while this certainly remained the key for a cure  this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me. To reach clinical fruition rapidly  it was obvious  I had to think about the problem differently. It turned out that more than     years of research on spinal cord physiology  starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington  had shown that the spinal cord  below most injuries  contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion  but because input from the brain is interrupted  they are in a nonfunctional state  like kind of dormant. My idea  We awaken this network. And at the time  I was a post doctoral fellow in Los Angeles  after completing my Ph.D. in France  where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted. I was afraid to talk to my new boss  but decided to muster up my courage. I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor  Reggie Edgerton  to share my new idea. He listened to me carefully  and responded with a grin.  Why don't you try   And I promise to you  this was such an important moment in my career  when I realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas. And this was the idea  I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated concept. Imagine that the locomotor system is a car. The engine is the spinal cord. The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off. How could we re engage the engine  First  we have to provide the fuel  second  press the accelerator pedal  third  steer the car. It turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion. My idea  Replace this missing input to provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk. For this  I leveraged    years of past research in neuroscience  first to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire  and second  to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation. So here imagine an electrode implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation. It took many years  but eventually we developed an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state. Immediately  the paralyzed rat can stand. As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving  the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg  but without the brain. Here what I call  the spinal brain  cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle in order to stand  to walk  to run  and even here  while sprinting  instantly stand if the treadmill stops moving. This was amazing. I was completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain  but at the same time so frustrated. This locomotion was completely involuntary. The animal had virtually no control over the legs. Clearly  the steering system was missing. And it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm  stepping on a treadmill  and develop conditions that would encourage the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg. With this in mind  we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in any direction of space. Imagine  this is really cool. So imagine the little     gram rat attached at the extremity of this     kilo robot  but the rat does not feel the robot. The robot is transparent  just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps. Let me summarize  The rat received a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord. The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks. The robot provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs. And for motivation  we used what I think is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland  fine Swiss chocolate. Actually  the first results were very  very  very disappointing. Here is my best physical therapist completely failing to encourage the rat to take a single step  whereas the same rat  five minutes earlier  walked beautifully on the treadmill. We were so frustrated. But you know  one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance. We insisted. We refined our paradigm  and after several months of training  the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand  and whenever she decided  initiated full weight bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards. This is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis. In fact    Thank you. In fact  not only could the rat initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground  they could even adjust leg movement  for example  to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase. I can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory. It took us    years of hard work to reach this goal. But the remaining question was  how  I mean  how is it possible  And here  what we found was completely unexpected. This novel training paradigm encouraged the brain to create new connections  some relay circuits that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control over the locomotor networks below the injury. And here  you can see one such example  where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red. This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center  and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron. But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area. It occurred throughout the central nervous system  including in the brain stem  where we observed up to     percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain. We did not aim to repair the spinal cord  yet we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury. And there is a very important message hidden behind this discovery. They are the result of a young team of very talented people  physical therapists  neurobiologists  neurosurgeons  engineers of all kinds  who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals. This is truly a trans disciplinary team. They are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of DNA. We are creating the next generation of M.D.'s and engineers capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside. And me  I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony. Now  I am sure you are all wondering  aren't you  will this help injured people  Me too  every day. The truth is that we don't know enough yet. This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury  but I begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people's quality of life. I would like you all to take a moment and dream with me. Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury. After a few weeks of recovery  we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord. At the same time  we will implant an electrode array  a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement  and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person's needs. This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis that will enable locomotion during training with a newly designed supporting system. And my hope is that after several months of training  there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion without the robot  maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation. My hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord. And this is a radically new concept that may apply to other neurological disorders  what I termed  personalized neuroprosthetics   where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces  I implanted throughout the nervous system  in the brain  in the spinal cord  even in peripheral nerves  based on patient specific impairments. But not to replace the lost function  no    to help the brain help itself. And I hope this enticed your imagination  because I can promise to you this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur  but when. And remember  we are only as great as our imagination  as big as our dream. Thank you. The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone. They've changed the world. However  largely to our surprise  they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state. It turned out that the capability to collect data  information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies  mostly U.S. intelligence agencies  watching over the rest of the world. We've heard about these starting with the revelations from June  . Edward Snowden started leaking information  top secret classified information  from the U.S. intelligence agencies  and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others. And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now  against the whole rest of the world. And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell  well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined. And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah. Due to be opened very soon  it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center. You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting. And it's a pretty big building. How big  Well  I can give you the numbers            square meters    but that doesn't really tell you very much. Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison. You think about the largest IKEA store you've ever been in. This is five times larger. How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store  Right  It's pretty big. We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever  keep it for extended periods of time  keep it for years  keep it for decades. And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all. And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone. Well  not exactly everyone  because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners. They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States. And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner. In fact     percent of the planet are foreigners. Right  So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us  all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet. But don't get me wrong  There are actually types of surveillance that are okay. I love freedom  but even I agree that some surveillance is fine. If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer  or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting  and they have leads and they have suspects  then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone  and to intercept his Internet communications. I'm not arguing that at all  but that's not what programs like PRISM are about. They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings. They're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent. So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this  well  the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations  there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations  saying that we knew all this already  we knew it was happening  there's nothing new here. And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you that we knew this already  because we did not know this already. Our worst fears might have been something like this  but we didn't know this was happening. Now we know for a fact it's happening. We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM. We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans. We didn't know about DoubleArrow. We did not know about Skywriter    all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies. But now we do. And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose. And what that means is that you take something which is secure  an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file  nobody can decrypt that file. Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file  it's going to take millions of years. So that's basically perfectly safe  uncrackable. You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose  making all of us less secure as an end result. A real world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because  you know  bad people might have house alarms  but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result. Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind. But of course  these intelligence agencies are doing their job. This is what they have been told to do  do signals intelligence  monitor telecommunications  monitor Internet traffic. That's what they're trying to do  and since most  a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted  they're trying to find ways around the encryption. One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms  which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose. They are completely out of control  and they should be brought back under control. So what do we actually know about the leaks  Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden. The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers  and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to. They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers. So for example  they name the collection from Microsoft started on September           for Yahoo on the March           and then others  Google  Facebook  Skype  Apple and so on. And every single one of these companies denies. They all say that this simply isn't true  that they are not giving backdoor access to their data. Yet we have these files. So is one of the parties lying  or is there some other alternative explanation  And one explanation would be that these parties  these service providers  are not cooperating. Instead  they've been hacked. That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked. In this case  they've been hacked by their own government. That might sound outlandish  but we already have cases where this has happened  for example  the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government  and which  to spread  subverted the security of the Windows Update network  meaning here  the company was hacked by their own government. And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well. Der Spiegel  from Germany  leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies. Inside NSA  the unit is called TAO  Tailored Access Operations  and inside GCHQ  which is the U.K. equivalent  it's called NAC  Network Analysis Centre. And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium. And what this really means is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose  and they discuss it in their slides completely casually  business as usual. Here's the primary target  here's the secondary target  here's the teaming. They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub. They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like  you know   Success   when they gain access to services like this. What the hell  And then there's the argument that okay  yes  this might be going on  but then again  other countries are doing it as well. All countries spy. And maybe that's true. Many countries spy  not all of them  but let's take an example. Let's take  for example  Sweden. I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States. When your data traffic goes through Sweden  their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic. All right  how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use  every day  U.S. based services  like  you know  run Windows or OSX  or use Facebook or LinkedIn  or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox  or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support  And the answer is  every single Swedish business leader does that every single day. And then we turn it around. How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services  And the answer is zero. So this is not balanced. It's not balanced by any means  not even close. And when we do have the occasional European success story  even those  then  typically end up being sold to the United States. Like  Skype used to be secure. It used to be end to end encrypted. Then it was sold to the United States. Today  it no longer is secure. So once again  we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose  making all of us less secure as an outcome. And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists. It's the war on terror. You shouldn't worry about it. Well  it's not the war on terror. Yes  part of it is war on terror  and yes  there are terrorists  and they do kill and maim  and we should fight them  but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders  to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil  to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament  and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament  right  It's not the war on terror. Part of it might be  and there are terrorists  but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them  Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists  And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom  Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat  we are ready to do anything at all  But people are scared about terrorists  and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide. Feel free to survey me if that helps. And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn't thought about this long enough. Because we have this thing called privacy  and if you really think that you have nothing to hide  please make sure that's the first thing you tell me  because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets  because obviously you can't keep a secret. But people are brutally honest with the Internet  and when these leaks started  many people were asking me about this. And I have nothing to hide. I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal. Yet  I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency  especially a foreign intelligence agency. And if we indeed need a Big Brother  I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother. And when the leaks started  the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how  when you've been using search engines  you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence. And two minutes later  I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me  like  why am I worried about this  What am I sending to worry about this  Am I sending naked pictures or something  And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business  and it should be none of your government's business either. Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy. Privacy is nonnegotiable. It should be built in to all the systems we use. And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines. You show me your search history  and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes. We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families. Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you. And this is all the kind of information we are giving away  we are giving away to the United States. And surveillance changes history. We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon. Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today. And let me actually quote the president of Brazil  Ms. Dilma Rousseff. She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. Her email was read  and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters  and she said   If there is no right to privacy  there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion  and therefore  there can be no effective democracy.  That's what it's about. Privacy is the building block of our democracies. And to quote a fellow security researcher  Marcus Ranum  he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies. So we are back to the age of colonization  and we  the foreign users of the Internet  we should think about Americans as our masters. So Mr. Snowden  he's been blamed for many things. Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations    and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming. So  what is there to be done  Should we worry. No  we shouldn't worry. We should be angry  because this is wrong  and it's rude  and it should not be done. But that's not going to really change the situation. What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States. And that's much easier said than done. How do you do that  A single country  any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S. made operating systems and cloud services. But maybe you don't have to do it alone. Maybe you can do it together with other countries. The solution is open source. By building together open  free  secure systems  we can go around such surveillance  and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself. It only has to solve one little problem. And to quote a fellow security researcher  Haroon Meer  one country only has to make a small wave  but those small waves together become a tide  and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time  and the tide we will build with secure  free  open source systems  will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state. Thank you very much. So why do we learn mathematics  Essentially  for three reasons  calculation  application  and last  and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it  inspiration. Mathematics is the science of patterns  and we study it to learn how to think logically  critically and creatively  but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated  and when our students ask   Why are we learning this   then they often hear that they'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test. But wouldn't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind  Now  I know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen  so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers  the Fibonacci numbers.  Applause  Yeah  I already have Fibonacci fans here. That's great. Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways. From the standpoint of calculation  they're as easy to understand as one plus one  which is two. Then one plus two is three  two plus three is five  three plus five is eight  and so on. Indeed  the person we call Fibonacci was actually named Leonardo of Pisa  and these numbers appear in his book  Liber Abaci   which taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today. In terms of applications  Fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often. The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number  or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a Fibonacci number as well. In fact  there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers  but what I find most inspirational about them are the beautiful number patterns they display. Let me show you one of my favorites. Suppose you like to square numbers  and frankly  who doesn't   Laughter  Let's look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. So one squared is one  two squared is four  three squared is nine  five squared is     and so on. Now  it's no surprise that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers  you get the next Fibonacci number. Right  That's how they're created. But you wouldn't expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together. But check this out. One plus one gives us two  and one plus four gives us five. And four plus nine is     nine plus    is     and yes  the pattern continues. In fact  here's another one. Suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. Let's see what we get there. So one plus one plus four is six. Add nine to that  we get   . Add     we get   . Add     we get    . Now look at those numbers. Those are not Fibonacci numbers  but if you look at them closely  you'll see the Fibonacci numbers buried inside of them. Do you see it  I'll show it to you. Six is two times three     is three times five     is five times eight  two  three  five  eight  who do we appreciate  Fibonacci  Of course. Now  as much fun as it is to discover these patterns  it's even more satisfying to understand why they are true. Let's look at that last equation. Why should the squares of one  one  two  three  five and eight add up to eight times     I'll show you by drawing a simple picture. We'll start with a one by one square and next to that put another one by one square. Together  they form a one by two rectangle. Beneath that  I'll put a two by two square  and next to that  a three by three square  beneath that  a five by five square  and then an eight by eight square  creating one giant rectangle  right  Now let me ask you a simple question  what is the area of the rectangle  Well  on the one hand  it's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it  right  Just as we created it. It's one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared. Right  That's the area. On the other hand  because it's a rectangle  the area is equal to its height times its base  and the height is clearly eight  and the base is five plus eight  which is the next Fibonacci number    . Right  So the area is also eight times   . Since we've correctly calculated the area two different ways  they have to be the same number  and that's why the squares of one  one  two  three  five and eight add up to eight times   . Now  if we continue this process  we'll generate rectangles of the form    by        by     and so on. Now check this out. If you divide    by eight  you get  .   . And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number  then these ratios get closer and closer to about  .     known to many people as the Golden Ratio  a number which has fascinated mathematicians  scientists and artists for centuries. Now  I show all this to you because  like so much of mathematics  there's a beautiful side to it that I fear does not get enough attention in our schools. We spend lots of time learning about calculation  but let's not forget about application  including  perhaps  the most important application of all  learning how to think. If I could summarize this in one sentence  it would be this  Mathematics is not just solving for x  it's also figuring out why. Thank you very much.  Give me liberty or give me death.  When Patrick Henry  the governor of Virginia  said these words in       he could never have imagined just how much they would come to resonate with American generations to come. At the time  these words were earmarked and targeted against the British  but over the last     years  they've come to embody what many Westerners believe  that freedom is the most cherished value  and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them. Who could blame them  Over the past hundred years  the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the United States and Western countries to new levels of economic development. In the United States over the past hundred years  incomes have increased    times  and hundreds of thousands of people have been moved out of poverty. Meanwhile  American ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions  motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets. It's no surprise  then  that even at the depths of the private capitalism crisis  President Obama said   The question before us is not whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is unmatched.  Thus  there's understandably a deep seated presumption among Westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism as the model of economic growth  liberal democracy  and will continue to prioritize political rights over economic rights. However  to many who live in the emerging markets  this is an illusion  and even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which was signed in       was unanimously adopted  what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries  and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights. This schism has only grown wider. Today  many people who live in the emerging markets  where    percent of the world's population lives  believe that the Western obsession with political rights is beside the point  and what is actually important is delivering on food  shelter  education and healthcare.  Give me liberty or give me death  is all well and good if you can afford it  but if you're living on less than one dollar a day  you're far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy. Now  I know many people in this room and around the world will think   Well actually  this is hard to grasp   because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct. But I ask you today  what would you do if you had to choose  What if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote  Over the last    years  I've had the privilege to travel to over    countries  many of them in the emerging markets  in Latin America  Asia  and my own continent of Africa. I've met with presidents  dissidents  policymakers  lawyers  teachers  doctors and the man on the street  and through these conversations  it's become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there's actually a split occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the West and that which people believe in the rest of the world. Now  don't get me wrong. I'm not saying people in the emerging markets don't understand democracy  nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders. Of course they would. However  I am saying that on balance  they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from  and how it is their governments can deliver for them  than whether or not the government was elected by democracy. The fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the Western ideological systems of politics and economics  and this is a system that is embodied by China. And rather than have private capitalism  they have state capitalism. Instead of liberal democracy  they have de prioritized the democratic system. And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights. I put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by China that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow  because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time. If you will indulge me  I will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they've come to this belief. First of all  it's China's economic performance over the past    years. She's been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty  specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over     million people out of indigence. It's not just in economics  but it's also in terms of living standards. We see that in China     percent of people had secondary school access. Today  it's closer to    percent. So in its totality  economic improvement has been quite significant. Second  China has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct. Today  the United States and China are the two leading economies in the world. They have vastly different political systems and different economic systems  one with private capitalism  another one broadly with state capitalism. However  these two countries have the identical GINI Coefficient  which is a measure of income equality. Perhaps what is more disturbing is that China's income equality has been improving in recent times  whereas that of the United States has been declining. Thirdly  people in the emerging markets look at China's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout. This is not just about China building roads and ports and railways in her own country    she's been able to build        kilometers of road network in China and surpass that of the United States    but even if you look to places like Africa  China has been able to help tar the distance of Cape Town to Cairo  which is       miles  or three times the distance of New York to California. Now this is something that people can see and point to. Perhaps it's no surprise that in a      Pew survey  when surveyed  Africans in    countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins  by as much as    percent. Finally  China is also providing innovative solutions to age old social problems that the world faces. If you travel to Mogadishu  Mexico City or Mumbai  you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas. However  through a network of state owned enterprises  the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas  using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions. Ladies and gentlemen  it's no surprise that around the world  people are pointing at what China is doing and saying   I like that. I want that. I want to be able to do what China's doing. That is the system that seems to work.  I'm here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what China is doing in the democratic stance. In particular  there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets  when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth. In fact  countries like Taiwan  Singapore  Chile  not just China  have shown that actually  it's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy. In a recent study  the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last. The study found that if your per capita income is about       dollars a year  your democracy will last about eight and a half years. If your per capita income is between       and       dollars per year  then you're likely to only get    years of democracy. And only if your per capita income is above       dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water. What this is telling us is that we need to first establish a middle class that is able to hold the government accountable. But perhaps it's also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning democracy  because ultimately we run the risk of ending up with illiberal democracies  democracies that in some sense could be worse than the authoritarian governments that they seek to replace. The evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing. Freedom House finds that although    percent of the world's countries today are democratic     percent of those countries are illiberal in the sense that people don't have free speech or freedom of movement. But also  we're finding from Freedom House in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years. What this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy  is we've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way  and that has its roots in economics. But it also says that as China moves toward being the largest economy in the world  something that is expected to happen by experts in       that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the West and the rest is likely to widen. What might that world look like  Well  the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism  greater protectionisms of nation states  but also  as I just pointed out a moment ago  ever declining political rights and individual rights. The question that is left for us in general is  what then should the West be doing  And I suggest that they have two options. The West can either compete or cooperate. If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model  and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy  this is basically going against headwinds  but it also would be a natural stance for the West to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the Chinese model of de prioritizing democracy  and state capitalism. Now the fact of the matter is  if the West decides to compete  it will create a wider schism. The other option is for the West to cooperate  and by cooperating I mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way what political and economic system works best for them. Now I'm sure some of you in the room will be thinking  well  this is like ceding to China  and this is a way  in other words  for the West to take a back seat. But I put it to you that if the United States and European countries want to remain globally influential  they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete  and by that  they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want. The fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with China  the West should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions. Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior  the West should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one. And instead of shoehorning democracy around the world  perhaps the West should take a leaf out of its own history book and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today. Indeed  the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer reminds us that it took the United States nearly     years from the time that the Constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the United States. Some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights. In fact  there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law. At its very best  the Western model speaks for itself. It's the model that put food on the table. It's the refrigerators. It put a man on the moon. But the fact of the matter is  although people back in the day used to point at the Western countries and say   I want that  I like that   there's now a new person in town in the form of a country  China. Today  generations are looking at China and saying   China can produce infrastructure  China can produce economic growth  and we like that.  Because ultimately  the question before us  and the question before seven billion people on the planet is  how can we create prosperity  People who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way  to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time. As you leave here today  I would like to leave you with a very personal message  which is what it is that I believe we should be doing as individuals  and this is really about being open minded  open minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world  creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people  has to be based in being open minded  because these systems have good things and they have bad things. Just to illustrate  I went into my annals of myself. That's a picture of me. Awww.  Laughter  I was born and raised in Zambia in     . At the time of my birth  blacks were not issued birth certificates  and that law only changed in     . This is an affidavit from the Zambian government. I bring this to you to tell you that in    years  I've gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today to talk to you about my views. In this vein  we can increase economic growth. We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty. But also  it's going to require that we look at our assumptions  assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with around democracy  around private capitalism  around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms. We might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open minded to seek the truth. Ultimately  it's about transforming the world and making it a better place. Thank you very much. So  stepping down out of the bus  I headed back to the corner to head west en route to a braille training session. It was the winter of       and I had been blind for about a year. Things were going pretty well. Safely reaching the other side  I turned to the left  pushed the auto button for the audible pedestrian signal  and waited my turn. As it went off  I took off and safely got to the other side. Stepping onto the sidewalk  I then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me. I know there's a cafe on the corner  and they have chairs out in front  so I just adjusted to the left to get closer to the street. As I did  so slid the chair. I just figured I'd made a mistake  and went back to the right  and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity. Now I was getting a little anxious. I went back to the left  and so slid the chair  blocking my path of travel. Now  I was officially freaking out. So I yelled   Who the hell's out there  What's going on   Just then  over my shout  I heard something else  a familiar rattle. It sounded familiar  and I quickly considered another possibility  and I reached out with my left hand  as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy  and I came across an ear  the ear of a dog  perhaps a golden retriever. Its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee  and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me  perhaps get a scratch behind the ear. Who knows  maybe she was volunteering for service. But that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight  seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you. So let me step back and set the stage a little bit. On St. Patrick's Day of       I reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor. The surgery was successful. Two days later  my sight started to fail. On the third day  it was gone. Immediately  I was struck by an incredible sense of fear  of confusion  of vulnerability  like anybody would. But as I had time to stop and think  I actually started to realize I had a lot to be grateful for. In particular  I thought about my dad  who had passed away from complications from brain surgery. He was   . I was seven at the time. So although I had every reason to be fearful of what was ahead  and had no clue quite what was going to happen  I was alive. My son still had his dad. And besides  it's not like I was the first person ever to lose their sight. I knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and meaningful  active life without sight. So by the time I was discharged from the hospital a few days later  I left with a mission  a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life. Within six months  I had returned to work. My training had started. I even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies  and was commuting to work on my own  walking through town and taking the bus. It was a lot of hard work. But what I didn't anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time. From that came a lot of insights  or outsights  as I called them  things that I learned since losing my sight. These outsights ranged from the trival to the profound  from the mundane to the humorous. As an architect  that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself. Paramount amongst those was the realization that  actually  cities are fantastic places for the blind. And then I was also surprised by the city's propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse. And then I started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a positive influence on the city itself. That was a little curious to me. Let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind. Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non visual senses  things that you would otherwise maybe ignore. It's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you. I was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are  how you need to move  and where you need to go. Similarly  just through the grip of the cane  you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below  and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you're headed. Similarly  just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space. But also  the sense of smell. Some districts and cities have their own smell  as do places and things around you  and if you're lucky  you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you've been looking for. All this really surprised me  because I started to realize that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi sensory than my sighted experience ever was. What struck me also was how much the city was changing around me. When you're sighted  everybody kind of sticks to themselves  you mind your own business. Lose your sight  though  and it's a whole other story. And I don't know who's watching who  but I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me. And I'm not paranoid  but everywhere I go  I'm getting all sorts of advice  Go here  move there  watch out for this. A lot of the information is good. Some of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed. You've got to figure out what they actually meant. Some of it's kind of wrong and not helpful. But it's all good in the grand scheme of things. But one time I was in Oakland walking along Broadway  and came to a corner. I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal  and as it went off  I was just about to step out into the street  when all of a sudden  my right hand was just gripped by this guy  and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street  speaking to me in Mandarin. It's like  there was no escape from this man's death grip  but he got me safely there. What could I do  But believe me  there are more polite ways to offer assistance. We don't know you're there  so it's kind of nice to say  Hello  first.  Would you like some help   But while in Oakland  I've really been struck by how much the city of Oakland changed as I lost my sight. I liked it sighted. It was fine. It's a perfectly great city. But once I lost my sight and was walking along Broadway  I was blessed every block of the way.  Bless you  man.   Go for it  brother.   God bless you.  I didn't get that sighted. And even without sight  I don't get that in San Francisco. And I know it bothers some of my blind friends  it's not just me. Often it's thought that that's an emotion that comes up out of pity. I tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity  out of our togetherness  and I think it's pretty cool. In fact  if I'm feeling down  I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland  I go for a walk  and I feel better like that  in no time at all. But also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic  social  racial  economic lines. Disability is an equal opportunity provider. Everybody's welcome. In fact  I've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people  There are those with disabilities  and there are those that haven't quite found theirs yet. It's a different way of thinking about it  but I think it's kind of beautiful  because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us versus them or the abled versus the disabled  and it's a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life. So my final takeaway for you is that not only is the city good for the blind  but the city needs us. And I'm so sure of that that I want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities  and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast. It's too late then. So if you design a city with the blind in mind  you'll have a rich  walkable network of sidewalks with a dense array of options and choices all available at the street level. If you design a city with the blind in mind  sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous. The space between buildings will be well balanced between people and cars. In fact  cars  who needs them  If you're blind  you don't drive.  Laughter  They don't like it when you drive.  Laughter  If you design a city with the blind in mind  you design a city with a robust  accessible  well connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around. If you design a city with the blind in mind  there'll be jobs  lots of jobs. Blind people want to work too. They want to earn a living. So  in designing a city for the blind  I hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more inclusive  a more equitable  a more just city for all. And based on my prior sighted experience  it sounds like a pretty cool city  whether you're blind  whether you have a disability  or you haven't quite found yours yet. So thank you. I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid. I don't know his name  but I do know his story. He lives in a small village in southern Somalia. His village is near Mogadishu. Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation. With nothing left for him there  he leaves for the big city  in this case  Mogadishu  the capital of Somalia. When he arrives  there are no opportunities  no jobs  no way forward. He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu. Maybe a year passes  nothing. One day  he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch  then to dinner  to breakfast. He meets this dynamic group of people  and they give him a break. He's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes  money to send back home to his family. He is introduced to this young woman. He eventually gets married. He starts this new life. He has a purpose in life. One beautiful day in Mogadishu  under an azure blue sky  a car bomb goes off. That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber  and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab  a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda. So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up  He was waiting. He was waiting for an opportunity  waiting to begin his future  waiting for a way forward  and this was the first thing that came along. This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood. And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world. It is the story of the disenfranchised  unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg  sparks riots in London  who reaches out for something other than waithood. For young people  the promise of the city  the big city dream is that of opportunity  of jobs  of wealth  but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities. Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates. By       three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of   . If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities  if we do not provide them opportunities  the story of waithood  the gateway to terrorism  to violence  to gangs  will be the story of cities  . . And in my city of birth  Mogadishu     percent of young people suffer from unemployment.    percent don't work  don't go to school. They pretty much do nothing. I went back to Mogadishu last month  and I went to visit Madina Hospital  the hospital I was born in. I remember standing in front of that bullet ridden hospital thinking  what if I had never left  What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood  Would I have become a terrorist  I'm not really sure about the answer. My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit. I brought together about    young Somali leaders. We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city. One of the young men in the room was Aden. He went to university in Mogadishu  graduated. There were no jobs  no opportunities. I remember him telling me  because he was a college graduate  unemployed  frustrated  that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations  to be recruited. They sought people like him out. But his story takes a different route. In Mogadishu  the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads. Twenty three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system  and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around. Aden saw an opportunity and seized it. He started a motorbike company. He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them. He bought    bikes  with the help of family and friends  and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years. How is this story different  What makes his story different  I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity. It's entrepreneurship  and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood. It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking. And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs. I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings  Mohamed Mohamoud  a florist. He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship. He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over    years  and until recently  until Mohamed came along  if you wanted flowers at your wedding  you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad. If you asked someone   When was the last time you saw fresh flowers   for many who grew up under civil war  the answer would be   Never.  So Mohamed saw an opportunity. He started a landscaping and design floral company. He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu  and started growing tulips and lilies  which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate. And he began delivering flowers to weddings  creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city  and he's now working on creating Mogadishu's first public park in    years. There's no public park in Mogadishu. He wants to create a space where families  young people  can come together  and  as he says  smell the proverbial roses. And he doesn't grow roses because they use too much water  by the way. So the first step is to inspire young people  and in that room  Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room. They had never really thought about starting up a business. They've thought about working for an NGO  working for the government  but his story  his innovation  really had a strong impact on them. He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity. He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs  that they could be change makers. By the end of the day  they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city. They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems. So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step  but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality. They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses. Connect young people with the resources they need  provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation  and you will create catalysts for urban growth. For me  entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business. It's about creating a social impact. Mohamed is not simply selling flowers. I believe he is selling hope. His Peace Park  and that's what he calls it  when it's created  will actually transform the way people see their city. Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him. He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood. These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities. So my suggestion is  turn youth into entrepreneurs  incubate and nurture their inherent innovation  and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood. Thank you. Five years ago  I was on a sabbatical  and I returned to the medical university where I studied. I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in    years  in fact since I became a management consultant. There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent. The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost cutting  and the second thing  which really bothered me  actually  was that several of the colleagues I met  former friends from medical school  who I knew to be some of the smartest  most motivated  engaged and passionate people I'd ever met  many of them had turned cynical  disengaged  or had distanced themselves from hospital management. So with this focus on cost cutting  I asked myself  are we forgetting the patient  Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare. It's a big part of the national budgets. And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth. In some countries  we have long waiting times for patients for surgery. In other countries  new drugs are not being reimbursed  and therefore don't reach patients. In several countries  doctors and nurses are the targets  to some extent  for the governments. After all  the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses. You choose an expensive lab test  you choose to operate on an old and frail patient. So  by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians  this is a way to hold costs down. And ultimately  some physicians will say today that they don't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients. So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated. At BCG  we looked at this  and we asked ourselves  this can't be the right way of managing healthcare. And so we took a step back and we said   What is it that we are trying to achieve   Ultimately  in the healthcare system  we're aiming at improving health for the patients  and we need to do so at a limited  or affordable  cost. We call this value based healthcare. On the screen behind me  you see what we mean by value  outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend. This was described beautifully in a book in      by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg. On this picture  you have my father in law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters. When we started doing our research at BCG  we decided not to look so much at the costs  but to look at the quality instead  and in the research  one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw. You compare hospitals in a country  you'll find some that are extremely good  but you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse. The differences were dramatic. Erik  my father in law  he suffers from prostate cancer  and he probably needs surgery. Now living in Europe  he can choose to go to Germany that has a well reputed healthcare system. If he goes there and goes to the average hospital  he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about    percent  so he would have to start wearing diapers again. You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot. If he instead would go to Hamburg  and to a clinic called the Martini Klinik  the risk would be only one in   . Either you a flip a coin  or you have a one in    risk. That's a huge difference  a seven fold difference. When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases  we see these huge differences. But you and I don't know. We don't have the data. And often  the data actually doesn't exist. Nobody knows. So going the hospital is a lottery. Now  it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope. In the late '  s  there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting  and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery. To the left of this slide  you see a variety of metal pieces  artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip. They all realized they had their individual way of operating. They all argued that   My technique is the best   but none of them actually knew  and they admitted that. So they said   We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what's best.  So they in fact spent two years debating   So what is quality in hip surgery    Oh  we should measure this.   No  we should measure that.  And they finally agreed. And once they had agreed  they started measuring  and started sharing the data. Very quickly  they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in  it actually lasted a lot longer  and most patients would never have to be re operated on in their lifetime. They published the data  and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country. Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense. Since then  they publish every year. Once a year  they publish the league table  who's best  who's at the bottom  And they visit each other to try to learn  so a continuous cycle of improvement. For many years  Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world  at least for those who actually were measuring  and many were not. Now I found this principle really exciting. So the physicians get together  they agree on what quality is  they start measuring  they share the data  they find who's best  and they learn from it. Continuous improvement. Now  that's not the only exciting part. That's exciting in itself. But if you bring back the cost side of the equation  and look at that  it turns out  those who have focused on quality  they actually also have the lowest costs  although that's not been the purpose in the first place. So if you look at the hip surgery story again  there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden. They looked at how many patients have needed to be re operated on seven years after the first surgery. In the United States  the number was three times higher than in Sweden. So many unnecessary surgeries  and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period. Now  you can imagine how much savings there would be for society. We did a study where we looked at OECD data. OECD does  every so often  look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries. The United States has  for many diseases  actually a quality which is below the average in OECD. Now  if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality  and raise quality just to the level of average OECD  it would save the American people     billion U.S. dollars a year. That's    percent of the budget  of the healthcare budget of the country. Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic  and it's all logical  but is it possible  This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare  and I would argue that not only can it be done  but it has to be done. The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system. In my practice as a consultant  I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year. The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients. Physicians are  like most of you in the audience  very competitive. They were always best in class. We were always best in class. And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do  they will do whatever it takes to improve. But most of them don't know. But physicians have another characteristic. They actually thrive from peer recognition. If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results  they will share. They will share the information on how to improve. So it is  by measuring and creating transparency  you get a cycle of continuous improvement  which is what this slide shows. Now  you may say this is a nice idea  but this isn't only an idea. This is happening in reality. We're creating a global community  and a large global community  where we'll be able to measure and compare what we achieve. Together with two academic institutions  Michael Porter at Harvard Business School  and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden  BCG has formed something we call ICHOM. You may think that's a sneeze  but it's not a sneeze  it's an acronym. It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement. We're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss  disease by disease  what is really quality  what should we measure  and to make those standards global. They've worked    four working groups have worked during the past year  cataracts  back pain  coronary artery disease  which is  for instance  heart attack  and prostate cancer. The four groups will publish their data in November of this year. That's the first time we'll be comparing apples to apples  not only within a country  but between countries. Next year  we're planning to do eight diseases  the year after    . In three years' time  we plan to have covered    percent of the disease burden. Compare apples to apples. Who's better  Why is that  Five months ago  I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe. They have a new CEO  and she has a vision  I want to manage my big institution much more on quality  outcomes that matter to patients. This particular day  we sat in a workshop together with physicians  nurses and other staff  discussing leukemia in children. The group discussed  how do we measure quality today  Can we measure it better than we do  We discussed  how do we treat these kids  what are important improvements  And we discussed what are the costs for these patients  can we do treatment more efficiently  There was an enormous energy in the room. There were so many ideas  so much enthusiasm. At the end of the meeting  the chairman of the department  he stood up. He looked over the group and he said    first he raised his hand  I forgot that    he raised his hand  clenched his fist  and then he said to the group   Thank you. Thank you. Today  we're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way.  By measuring value in healthcare  that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients  we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution. I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution  and I'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine  the Greek Hippocrates  who always put the patient at the center  he would smile in his grave. Thank you. Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game  massively multiplayer thumb wrestling. It's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you  the player  the opportunity to experience    positive emotions in    seconds or less. This is true  so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute  you will get to feel joy  relief  love  surprise  pride  curiosity  excitement  awe and wonder  contentment  and creativity  all in the span of one minute. So this sounds pretty good  right  Now you're willing to play. In order to teach you this game  I'm going to need some volunteers to come up onstage really quickly  and we're going to do a little hands on demo. While they're coming up  I should let you know  this game was invented    years ago by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom. So thank you  Monochrom. Okay  so most people are familiar with traditional  two person thumb wrestling. Sunni  let's just remind them. One  two  three  four   I declare a thumb war  and we wrestle  and of course Sunni beats me because she's the best. Now the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb wrestling  we're the gamer generation. There are a billion gamers on the planet now  so we need more of a challenge. So the first thing we need is more thumbs. So Eric  come on over. So we could get three thumbs together  and Peter could join us. We could even have four thumbs together  and the way you win is you're the first person to pin someone else's thumb. This is really important. You can't  like  wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute. That is not how you win. Ah  who did that  Eric you did that. So Eric would have won. He was the first person to pin my thumb. Okay  so that's the first rule  and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node  but if you feel ambitious  you don't have to hold back. We can really go for it. So you can see up here. Now the only other rule you need to remember is  gamer generation  we like a challenge. I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you're not using. So I think we should kind of get some more involved. And if we had just four people  we would do it just like this  and we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time. Perfect. Now  if we had more people in the room  instead of just wrestling in a closed node  we might reach out and try and grab some other people. And in fact  that's what we're going to do right now. We're going to try and get all  something like  I don't know        thumbs in this room connected in a single node. And we have to connect both levels  so if you're up there  you're going to be reaching down and reaching up. Now    Laughter    before we get started    This is great. You're excited to play.   before we get started  can I have the slides back up here really quick  because if you get good at this game  I want you to know there are some advanced levels. So this is the kind of simple level  right  But there are advanced configurations. This is called the Death Star Configuration. Any Star Wars fans  And this one's called the M bius Strip. Any science geeks  you get that one. This is the hardest level. This is the extreme. So we'll stick with the normal one for now  and I'm going to give you    seconds  every thumb into the node  connect the upper and the lower levels  you guys go on down there. Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node. Stand up  It's easier if you stand up. Everybody  up up up up up  Stand up  my friends. All right. Don't start wrestling yet. If you have a free thumb  wave it around  make sure it gets connected. Okay. We need to do a last minute thumb check. If you have a free thumb  wave it around to make sure. Grab that thumb  Reach behind you. There you go. Any other thumbs  Okay  on the count of three  you're going to go. Try to keep track. Grab  grab  grab it. Okay  One  two  three  go  Did you win  You got it  You got it  Excellent  Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. While you are basking in the glow of having won your first massively multiplayer thumb wrestling game  let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions. So curiosity. I said  massively multiplayer thumb wrestling.  You were like   What the hell is she talking about   So I provoked a little curiosity. Creativity  it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node. I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up. So you used creativity. That was great. How about surprise  The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising. You heard that sound go up in the room. We had excitement. As you started to wrestle  maybe you're starting to win or this person's  like  really into it  so you kind of get the excitement going. We have relief. You got to stand up. You've been sitting for awhile  so the physical relief  getting to shake it out. We had joy. You were laughing  smiling. Look at your faces. This room is full of joy. We had some contentment. I didn't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing  so you were totally content to be playing. The most important three emotions  awe and wonder  we had everybody connected physically for a minute. When was the last time you were at TED and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room  And it's truly awesome and wondrous. And speaking of physical connection  you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin  you release oxytocin  you feel bonded to everyone in the room. You guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else's hand for at least six seconds. You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds  so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other. That is great. And the last emotion of pride. How many people are like me. Just admit it. You lost both your thumbs. It just didn't work out for you. That's okay  because you learned a new skill today. You learned  from scratch  a game you never knew before. Now you know how to play it. You can teach other people. So congratulations. How many of you won just won thumb  All right. I have very good news for you. According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb wrestling  this makes you a grandmaster of the game. Because there aren't that many people who know how to play  we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess. So congratulations  grandmasters. Win one thumb once  you will become a grandmaster. Did anybody win both their thumbs  Yes. Awesome. Okay. Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status. You guys  according to the rules  are legendary grandmasters  so congratulations. I will just leave you with this tip  if you want to play again. The best way to become a legendary grandmaster  you've got your two nodes going on. Pick off the one that looks easiest. They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak. Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm. As soon as you win  suddenly stop. Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill. That's how you become a legendary grandmaster of massively multiplayer thumb wrestling. Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game. Wooo   Applause  Thank you.  Applause  When we think of Nepal  we tend to think of the snow capped mountains of the Himalayas  the crystal clear still waters of its alpine lakes  or the huge expanse of its grasslands. What some of us may not realize is that in the Himalayan foothills  where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener  there lives a great diversity of wildlife  including the one horned rhinoceros  the Asian elephant and the Bengal tiger. But unfortunately  these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body parts. To stop the killing of these animals  battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect Nepal's national parks  but that is not an easy task  because these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs. It is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers  and therefore Nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife. Well recently  Nepal acquired a new tool in the fight against wildlife crime  and these are drones  or more specifically  conservation drones. For about a year now  my colleagues and I have been building drones for Nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones. Not only does a drone give you a bird's eye view of the landscape  but it also allows you to capture detailed  high resolution images of objects on the ground. This  for example  is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of Nepal. Now we believe that drones have tremendous potential  not only for combating wildlife crime  but also for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations. So what is a drone  Well  the kind of drone I'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system  and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer  a GPS  a compass  a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors. Now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload  such as a video camera or a photographic camera. It also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission  to tell the drone where to go. Now people I talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone  but they are even more surprised when I tell them how affordable these components are. The facts is  a conservation drone doesn't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars. So now that you've built your own conservation drone  you probably want to go fly it  but how does one fly a drone  Well  actually  you don't  because the drone flies itself. All you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly. But you simply do that by clicking on a few way points on the Google Maps interface using the open source software. Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points  or they could be slightly longer and more complicated  to fly along a river system. Sometimes  we fly the drone in a lawnmower type pattern and take pictures of that area  and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest. Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally. Now whatever your mission is  once you've programmed it  you simply upload it to the autopilot system  bring your drone to the field  and launch it simply by tossing it in the air. And often we'll go about this mission taking pictures or videos along the way  and usually at that point  we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee  sit back  and relax for the next few minutes  although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return. Usually it does  and when it does  it even lands automatically. So what can we do with a conservation drone  Well  when we built our first prototype drone  our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in North Sumatra  Indonesia  to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan. The reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of this species are still left in that forest. Now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops where you might find an orangutan or its nest. Now as you can imagine  that is a very time consuming  labor intensive  and costly process  so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. So we were very excited when we captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera. And this is it  this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone. Since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from around various parts of Southeast Asia  and we're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we've collected so far. But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect. This is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree  seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead  not once but several times. We've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in Gabon  elephants  and even turtle nests. But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves  we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in  because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats. Sometimes  we zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape. This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra. Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world  so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in Southeast Asia. But drones could also be used to keep track of illegal logging activities. This is a recently logged forest  again in Sumatra. You could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground. But perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape  and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change  to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding  where forests might be contracting  or where fires might be breaking out. Aerial images could also be processed to produce three dimensional computer models of forests. Now these models are not just visually appealing  but they are also geometrically accurate  which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees  calculate surface area  the volume of vegetation  and so on  all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests. Recently  we've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras. Now these cameras can detect heat emitting objects from the ground  and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night. So I've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are  how you might operate one of these drones  and what a drone could do for you. I will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world. We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland. We brought a few of these to Indonesia for the first few test flights. Since then  we've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world  and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations. Perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones. Building drones for us is a constant work in progress. We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range  their ruggedness  and the amount of payload they can carry. We also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones. For example  camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests  but these are motion activated cameras  so they snap a picture every time an animal crosses their path. But the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images  and that takes a lot of time  especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest. Now a drone could be designed to perform the task much more efficiently. This drone  carrying a special sensor  could be flown over the forest and remotely download these images from wi fi enabled cameras. Radio collars are another tool that's commonly used by biologists. Now these collars are put onto animals. They transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape. But the traditional way of tracking animals is pretty ridiculous  because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna  not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have on our rooftops. Some of us still do. A drone could be used to do the same job much more efficiently. Why not equip a drone with a scanning radio receiver  fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest. A third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones is to fly them to a really remote  never explored before rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics  and parachute down a tiny spy microphone that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals  birds  amphibians  the Yeti  the Sasquatch  Bigfoot  whatever. That would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests. And finally  I would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone. The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters. It weighs only about two kilograms  but it can carry half its weight. It is a fully autonomous system. During its mission  it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop  which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time. It carries a variety of sensors  and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel. This drone can stay in the air for    to    minutes  which gives it a range of up to    kilometers. That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications. Now  conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology. And we believe  strongly believe  that drones can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications. We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes. And in a way  they are right. I mean  let's be honest  drones are the ultimate toys for boys. But at the same time  we've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision and see the potential of conservation drones. To us  it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool  including drones  in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet. Thank you. Technology can change our understanding of nature. Take for example the case of lions. For centuries  it's been said that female lions do all of the hunting out in the open savanna  and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner. You've heard this too  I can tell. Well recently  I led an airborne mapping campaign in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars on male and female lions  and we mapped their hunting behavior from the air. The lower left shows a lion sizing up a herd of impala for a kill  and the right shows what I call the lion viewshed. That's how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation. And what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be. They just use a different strategy. Whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances  usually during the day  male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation  and often at night. This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right. Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation  and the white are wide open spaces. And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions. All of a sudden  you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting. I bring up this example to begin  because it emphasizes how little we know about nature. There's been a huge amount of work done so far to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests  and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate  as shown in red on the slide. I find it ironic that we're doing so much  yet these areas are fairly unknown to science. So how can we save what we don't understand  Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer with a background in physics and chemistry and biology and a lot of other boring subjects  but above all  I'm obsessed with what we don't know about our planet. So I created this  the Carnegie Airborne Observatory  or CAO. It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job  but I packed it with over       kilos of high tech sensors  computers  and a very motivated staff of Earth scientists and pilots. Two of our instruments are very unique  one is called an imaging spectrometer that can actually measure the chemical composition of plants as we fly over them. Another one is a set of lasers  very high powered lasers  that fire out of the bottom of the plane  sweeping across the ecosystem and measuring it at nearly         times per second in high resolution  D. Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco  not far from where I live. Although we flew straight over this bridge  we imaged it in  D  captured its color in just a few seconds. But the real power of the CAO is its ability to capture the actual building blocks of ecosystems. This is a small town in the Amazon  imaged with the CAO. We can slice through our data and see  for example  the  D structure of the vegetation and the buildings  or we can use the chemical information to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing as we fly over them. The hottest pinks are the fastest growing plants. And we can see biodiversity in ways that you never could have imagined. This is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon. This is how we see a rainforest  in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another. But you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales  and what that means is that they're impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them. So our imagery is  D  it's chemical  it's biological  and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy  but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest. Now I created the CAO in order to answer questions that have proven extremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point  such as from the ground  or from satellite sensors. I want to share three of those questions with you today. The first questions is  how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests  Tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees  and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we're going to avoid any further global warming. Unfortunately  global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector. That's all ships  airplanes  trains  and automobiles combined. So it's understandable that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation  but they're doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science. If you don't know where the carbon is exactly  in detail  how can you know what you're losing  Basically  we need a high tech accounting system. With our system  we're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail. The red shows  obviously  closed canopy tropical forest  and then you see the cookie cutting  or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens. It's like cutting a cake except this cake is about whale deep. And yet  we can zoom in and see the forest and the trees at the same time. And what's amazing is  even though we flew very high above this forest  later on in analysis  we can go in and actually experience the treetrops  leaf by leaf  branch by branch  just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves. We've been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the Amazon Basin and not so faraway places like the United States and Central America. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you on a high resolution  first time tour of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama. The colors are going to be going from red to blue. Red is extremely high carbon stocks  your largest cathedral forests you can imagine  and blue are very low carbon stocks. And let me tell you  Peru alone is an amazing place  totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today. We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red  and the Amazon River and floodplain cutting right through it. We can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation in blue  and the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange. We can also fly to the southern Andes to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geography ends as we go up into the mountain system. And we can go to the biggest swamp in the western Amazon. It's a watery dreamworld akin to Jim Cameron's  Avatar.  We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries  Panama  and see also a huge range of carbon variation  from high in red to low in blue. Unfortunately  most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands  but what you see that's left  in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds  is the stuff that's up in the mountains. One interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen. You're seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal. That's in the reds and yellows. The canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce. This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development. It's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change. My second question  How do we prepare for climate change in a place like the Amazon rainforest  Let me tell you  I spend a lot of time in these places  and we're seeing the climate changing already. Temperatures are increasing  and what's really happening is we're getting a lot of droughts  recurring droughts. The      mega drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe. The Amazon was so dry in      that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself dried up partially  as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide. What we found is that in very remote areas  these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests. For example  these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the      drought. This area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil  totally unexplored  almost totally unknown scientifically. So what we think  as Earth scientists  is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the Andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change. One of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak. Look at this     square kilometer gash in the forest created by gold miners. You see the forest in green in  D  and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface. Species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this  obviously. If you haven't been to the Amazon  you should go. It's an amazing experience every time  no matter where you go. You're going to probably see it this way  on a river. But what happens is a lot of times the rivers hide what's really going on back in the forest itself. We flew over this same river  imaged the system in  D. The forest is on the left. And then we can digitally remove the forest and see what's going on below the canopy. And in this case  we found gold mining activity  all of it illegal  set back away from the river's edge  as you'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right. Don't worry  we're working with the authorities to deal with this and many  many other problems in the region. So in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique  important corridors like the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor  we have to start making geographically explicit plans now. How do we do that if we don't know the geography of biodiversity in the region  if it's so unknown to science  So what we've been doing is using the laser guided spectroscopy from the CAO to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest. Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors. Reds are one type of species  blues are another  and greens are yet another. And when we take this together and scale up to the regional level  we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work. This tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat  and that's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate shifts. And this is the pivotal information that's needed by decision makers to develop protected areas in the context of their regional development plans. And third and final question is  how do we manage biodiversity on a planet of protected ecosystems  The example I started out with about lions hunting  that was a study we did behind the fence line of a protected area in South Africa. And the truth is  much of Africa's nature is going to persist into the future in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen. This puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management. They need to do and make decisions that will benefit all of the species that they're protecting. Some of their decisions have really big impacts. For example  how much and where to use fire as a management tool  Or  how to deal with a large species like elephants  which may  if their populations get too large  have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species. And let me tell you  these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape. In the foreground is an area with lots of fire and lots of elephants  wide open savanna in blue  and just a few trees. As we cross this fence line  now we're getting into an area that has had protection from fire and zero elephants  dense vegetation  a radically different ecosystem. And in a place like Kruger  the soaring elephant densities are a real problem. I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you  and there are no easy answers with this. But what's good is that the technology we've developed and we're working with in South Africa  for example  is allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna  and then through repeat flights we're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants  in the red as you see on the screen  and how much that's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna. That's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you. So really  the way we're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it as tending to a circle of life  where we have fire management  elephant management  those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem  and then those impacts affecting everything from insects up to apex predators like lions. Going forward  I plan to greatly expand the airborne observatory. I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet with technologies like this. Until then  you're going to find me flying in some remote place that you've never heard of. I just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet  but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it. Thank you. Sarge Salman  All the way from Los Altos Hills  California  Mr. Henry Evans. Henry Evans  Hello. My name is Henry Evans  and until August           I was living my version of the American dream. I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis. My dad was a lawyer. My mom was a homemaker. My six siblings and I were good kids  but caused our fair share of trouble. After high school  I left home to study and learn more about the world. I went to Notre Dame University and graduated with degrees in accounting and German  including spending a year of study in Austria. Later on  I earned an MBA at Stanford. I married my high school sweetheart  Jane. I am lucky to have her. Together  we raised four wonderful children. I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder  eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley  a job I really enjoyed. My family and I bought our first and only home on December           a fixer upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills  California  from where I am speaking to you now. We were looking forward to rebuilding it  but eight months after we moved in  I suffered a stroke like attack caused by a birth defect. Overnight  I became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of   . It took me several years  but with the help of an incredibly supportive family  I finally decided life was still worth living. I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled. Head tracking devices sold commercially by the company Madentec convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements  and enable my use of a regular computer. I can surf the web  exchange email with people  and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins in online word games. This technology allows me to remain engaged  mentally active  and feel like I am a part of the world. One day  I was lying in bed watching CNN  when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR  robot. I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage  and we formed the Robots for Humanity project. For about two years  Robots for Humanity developed ways for me to use the PR  as my body surrogate. I shaved myself for the first time in    years. From my home in California  I shaved Charlie in Atlanta.  Laughter  I handed out Halloween candy. I opened my refrigerator on my own. I began doing tasks around the house. I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute  both for myself and others in my circumstance. All of us have disabilities in one form or another. For example  if either of us wants to go    miles an hour  both of us will need an assistive device called a car. Your disability doesn't make you any less of a person  and neither does mine. By the way  check out my sweet ride.  Laughter  Since birth  we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own. Last year  Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage connected with me Chad Jenkins. Chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones. It was then I realized that I could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight  giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible. Using a mouse cursor I control with my head  these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser. With a little practice  I became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own. I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing. I inspected the solar panels on our roof.  Laughter  One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop. I went even further by seeing if I could use a head mounted display  the Oculus Rift  as modified by Fighting Walrus  to have an immersive experience controlling the drone. With Chad's group at Brown  I regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week  from my home       miles away. All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic  so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer.  Laughter  I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own. I just wish I could afford the tuition.  Laughter  Chad Jenkins  Henry  all joking aside  I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California       miles away. Okay  Henry  have you been to D.C. lately  Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic  Can you show us how excited you are  All right  big finish. Can you show us how good of a pilot you are  All right  we still have a little ways to go with that  but I think it shows the promise. What makes Henry's story amazing is it's about understanding Henry's needs  understanding what people in Henry's situation need from technology  and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide  and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way. What we're trying to do is democratize robotics  so that anybody can be a part of this. We're providing affordable  off the shelf robot platforms such as the A.R. drone      dollars  the Suitable Technologies beam  only        dollars  along with open source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do. And our hope is that  by providing these tools  that you'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled  to provide care for our aging population  to help better educate our children  to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future  to both monitor and protect our environment  and to explore the universe. Back to you  Henry. HE  Thank you  Chad. With this drone setup  we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world  and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination  where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else  and perhaps better  and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables. One hundred years ago  I would have been treated like a vegetable. Actually  that's not true. I would have died. It is up to us  all of us  to decide how robotics will be used  for good or for evil  for simply replacing people or for making people better  for allowing us to do and enjoy more. Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe. With the help of people like you  we can make this dream a reality. Thank you. One billion people in the world today do not have access to all season roads. One billion people. One seventh of the Earth's population are totally cut off for some part of the year. We cannot get medicine to them reliably  they cannot get critical supplies  and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income. In sub Saharan Africa  for instance     percent of roads are unusable in the wet season. Investments are being made  but at the current level  it's estimated it's going to take them    years to catch up. In the U.S. alone  there's more than four million miles of roads  very expensive to build  very expensive to maintain infrastructure  with a huge ecological footprint  and yet  very often  congested. So we saw this and we thought  can there be a better way  Can we create a system using today's most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they've done with mobile telephones in the last    years  Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the ground. Could we do the same for transportation  Imagine this scenario. Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali  and have a newborn in need of urgent medication. What would you do today  Well  you would place a request via mobile phone  and someone would get the request immediately. That's the part that works. The medication may take days to arrive  though  because of bad roads. That's the part that's broken. We believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this. This can transport a small payload today  about two kilograms  over a short distance  about    kilometers  but it's part of a wider network that may cover the entire country  maybe even the entire continent. It's an ultra flexible  automated logistics network. It's a network for a transportation of matter. We call it Matternet. We use three key technologies. The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles. The second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and fly farther  or pick up or deliver loads. And the third is the operating system that manages the whole network. Let's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail. First of all  the UAVs. Eventually  we're going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges. Today  we're using small quads. These are able to transport two kilograms over    kilometers in just about    minutes. Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world  or even being stuck in traffic in a developed world country. These fly autonomously. This is the key to the technology. So they use GPS and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations. Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism  so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations  they dock  swap a battery automatically  and go out again. The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground. They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission  which is the landing. They are at known locations on the ground  so the paths between them are also known  which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network. Apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles  eventually they're going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network. The last component is the operating system that manages the whole network. It monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions  avoid other risk factors  and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network. I want to show you what one of those flights looks like. Here we are flying in Haiti last summer  where we've done our first field trials. We're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the      earthquake. People there love this. And I want to show you what one of those vehicles looks like up close. So this is a        vehicle. Costs are coming down very rapidly. We use this in all sorts of weather conditions  very hot and very cold climates  very strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles. Imagine if your life depended on this package  somewhere in Africa or in New York City  after Sandy. The next big question is  what's the cost  Well  it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over    kilometers with this vehicle is just    cents. And it's counterintuitive  but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today  and we're just at the beginning of this. When we saw this  we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world. So we said  okay  how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world  And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho for transportation of HIV AIDS samples. The problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they're being collected to hospitals where they're being analyzed  And we said  what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around     square kilometers  That's roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan. Well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars. Compare this to normal infrastructure investments. We think this can be    this is the power of a new paradigm. So here we are  a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the Internet. It's decentralized  it's peer to peer  it's bidirectional  highly adaptable  with very low infrastructure investment  very low ecological footprint. If it is a new paradigm  though  there must be other uses for it. It can be used perhaps in other places in the world. So let's look at the other end of the spectrum  our cities and megacities. Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today. Half a billion of us live in megacities. We are living through an amazing urbanization trend. China alone is adding a megacity the size of New York City every two years. These are places that do have road infrastructure  but it's very inefficient. Congestion is a huge problem. So we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the Internet  initially for lightweight  urgent stuff  and over time  we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem. It's ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint  operating in the background       just like the Internet. So when we started this a couple of years ago now  we've had a lot of people come up to us who said   This is a very interesting but crazy idea  and certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon.  And of course  we're talking about drones  right  a technology that's not only unpopular in the West but one that has become a very  very unpleasant fact of life for many living in poor countries  especially those engaged in conflict. So why are we doing this  Well  we chose to do this one not because it's easy  but because it can have amazing impact. Imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them to information. Imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter. In the developing world  we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines  reach them with better medication. It would give us an unfair advantage against battling HIV AIDS  tuberculosis and other epidemics. Over time  we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions  lifting millions of people out of poverty. In the developed world and the emerging world  we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable. So for those that still believe that this is science fiction  I firmly say to you that it is not. We do need to engage  though  in social fiction to make it happen. Thank you. So yesterday  I was out in the street in front of this building  and I was walking down the sidewalk  and I had company  several of us  and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down sidewalks. We're not talking each other. We're facing forward. We're moving. When the person in front of me slows down. And so I'm watching him  and he slows down  and finally he stops. Well  that wasn't fast enough for me  so I put on my turn signal  and I walked around him  and as I walked  I looked to see what he was doing  and he was doing this. He was texting  and he couldn't text and walk at the same time. Now we could approach this from a working memory perspective or from a multitasking perspective. We're going to do working memory today. Now  working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day. You're going it right now. It's not something we can turn off. If you turn it off  that's called a coma  okay  So right now  you're doing just fine. Now working memory has four basic components. It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge. It allows us to reach back into our long term memory and pull some of that in as we need it  mixes it  processes it in light of whatever our current goal is. Now the current goal isn't something like  I want to be president or the best surfer in the world. It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie  or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room. Now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that  our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal. Now working memory capacity has a fairly long history  and it's associated with a lot of positive effects. People with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers. They tend to solve and do well on standardized tests  however important that is. They're able to have high levels of writing ability. They're also able to reason at high levels. So what we're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that. So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks  and we're going to take your  working memory out for a ride. You up for that  Okay. I'm going to give you five words  and I just want you to hang on to them. Don't write them down. Just hang on to them. Five words. While you're hanging on to them  I'm going to ask you to answer three questions. I want to see what happens with those words. So here's the words  tree  highway  mirror  Saturn and electrode. So far so good  Okay. What I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to    times eight. Just shout it out. In fact it's     Mumbling     exactly.  Laughter  All right. I want you to take out your left hand and I want you to go   One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine    .  It's a neurological test  just in case you were wondering. All right  now what I want you to do is to recite the last five letters of the English alphabet backwards. You should have started with Z. All right. How many people here are still pretty sure you've got all five words  Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half  right  which is normal. There will be a range. Some people can hang on to five. Some people can hang on to   . Some will be down to two or three. What we know is this is really important to the way we function  right  And it's going to be really important here at TED because you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas. Now the problem that we have is that life comes at us  and it comes at us very quickly  and what we need to do is to take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it with a working memory that's about the size of a pea. Now don't get me wrong  working memory is awesome. Working memory allows us to investigate our current experience as we move forward. It allows us to make sense of the world around us. But it does have certain limits. Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate. We can have a conversation  and I can build a narrative around that so I know where we've been and where we're going and how to contribute to this conversation. It allows us to problem solve  critical think. We can be in the middle of a meeting  listen to somebody's presentation  evaluate it  decide whether or not we like it  ask follow up questions. All of that occurs within working memory. It also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is Red Bull and bacon.  Laughter  Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for. Now  a central issue with working memory is that it's limited. It's limited in capacity  limited in duration  limited in focus. We tend to remember about four things. Okay  It used to be seven  but with functional MRIs  apparently it's four  and we were overachieving. Now we can remember those four things for about    to    seconds unless we do something with it  unless we process it  unless we apply it to something  unless we talk to somebody about it. When we think about working memory  we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us. Have you ever walked from one room to another and then forgotten why you're there  You do know the solution to that  right  You go back to that original room.  Laughter  Have you ever forgotten your keys  You ever forgotten your car  You ever forgotten your kids  Have you ever been involved in a conversation  and you realize that the conversation to your left is actually more interesting   Laughter  So you're nodding and you're smiling  but you're really paying attention to this one over here  until you hear that last word go up  and you realize  you've been asked a question.  Laughter  And you're really hoping the answer is no  because that's what you're about to say. All of that talks about working memory  what we can do and what we can't do. We need to realize that working memory has a limited capacity  and that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that. We negotiate that through strategies. So what I want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here  and these will be really important because you are now in an information target rich environment for the next several days. Now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence  our life  immediately and repeatedly. We need to process what's going on the moment it happens  not    minutes later  not a week later  at the moment. So we need to think about  well  do I agree with him  What's missing  What would I like to know  Do I agree with the assumptions  How can I apply this in my life  It's a way of processing what's going on so that we can use it later. Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice. So we need to think about it here. In between  we want to talk to people about it. We're going to write it down  and when you get home  pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time. Practice for some reason became a very negative thing. It's very positive. The next thing is  we need to think elaboratively and we need to think illustratively. Oftentimes  we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge. What we want to do is spin that around. We want to take all of our existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful. We also want to use imagery. We are built for images. We need to take advantage of that. Think about things in images  write things down that way. If you read a book  pull things up. I just got through reading  The Great Gatsby   and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head  so my own version. The last one is organization and support. We are meaning making machines. It's what we do. We try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us. Organization helps  so we need to structure what we're doing in ways that make sense. If we are providing knowledge and experience  we need to structure that. And the last one is support. We all started as novices. Everything we do is an approximation of sophistication. We should expect it to change over time. We have to support that. The support may come in asking people questions  giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images  but we need to support it. Now  the final piece of this  the take home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this  what we process  we learn. If we're not processing life  we're not living it. Live life. Thank you. To give me an idea of how many of you here may find what I'm about to tell you of practical value  let me ask you please to raise your hands  Who here is either over    years old or hopes to live past age    or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past     raise your hands please.  Laughter  Okay. You are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value.  Laughter  The rest of you won't find my talk personally relevant  but I think that you will still find the subject fascinating. I'm going to talk about growing older in traditional societies. This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book  which compares traditional  small  tribal societies with our large  modern societies  with respect to many topics such as bringing up children  growing older  health  dealing with danger  settling disputes  religion and speaking more than one language. Those tribal societies  which constituted all human societies for most of human history  are far more diverse than are our modern  recent  big societies. All big societies that have governments  and where most people are strangers to each other  are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies. Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society. They constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn. Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned as primitive and miserable  but also they shouldn't be romanticized as happy and peaceful. When we learn of tribal practices  some of them will horrify us  but there are other tribal practices which  when we hear about them  we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves. Most old people in the U.S. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years  and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly  whereas in traditional societies  older people instead live out their lives among their children  their other relatives  and their lifelong friends. Nevertheless  the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies  from much worse to much better than in our modern societies. At the worst extreme  many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways  by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die  or by abandoning them when the group moves  or by encouraging older people to commit suicide  or by killing older people. In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents  It happens mainly under two conditions. One is in nomadic  hunter gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can't walk when the able bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions. The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments  such as the Arctic or deserts  where there are periodic food shortages  and occasionally there just isn't enough food to keep everyone alive. Whatever food is available has to be reserved for able bodied adults and for children. To us Americans  it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father  but what could those traditional societies do differently  They face a cruel situation of no choice. Their old people had to do it to their own parents  and the old people know what now is going to happen to them. At the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly  the happy extreme  are the New Guinea farming societies where I've been doing my fieldwork  for the past    years  and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world. In those societies  older people are cared for. They are fed. They remain valuable. And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children  relatives and lifelong friends. There are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people. The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society's values. First  as regards usefulness  older people continue to perform useful services. One use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food. Another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren  thereby freeing up their own adult children  the parents of those grandchildren  to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren. Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools  weapons  baskets  pots and textiles. In fact  they're usually the people who are best at it. Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies  and the people most knowledgeable about politics  medicine  religion  songs and dances. Finally  older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern  literate societies  where our sources of information are books and the Internet. In contrast  in traditional societies without writing  older people are the repositories of information. It's their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience. Those  then  are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies. Their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society's treatment of the elderly. The other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society's cultural values. For example  there's particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in East Asia  associated with Confucius' doctrine of filial piety  which means obedience  respect and support for elderly parents. Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S. Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications. They're at a big disadvantage in hospitals. Our hospitals have an explicit policy called age based allocation of healthcare resources. That sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited  for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant  or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients  American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them  even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them. There are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the U.S. One is our Protestant work ethic which places high value on work  so older people who are no longer working aren't respected. Another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self reliance and independence  so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self reliant and independent. Still a third reason is our American cult of youth  which shows up even in our advertisements. Ads for Coca Cola and beer always depict smiling young people  even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca Cola and beer. Just think  what's the last time you saw a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people    years old  Never. Instead  the only American ads featuring white haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning. Well  what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies  There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse. Big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives  much better health in our old age  and much better recreational opportunities. Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people. Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past. That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people  and that each old person has less individual value. Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age  because older people  their children  and their friends  all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives. We Americans move on the average every five years. Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth. Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce  carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self esteem associated with work. Perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies. Widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge. When we want some information  we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask. The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old  but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful    years later. And conversely  we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society. For example  as a    year old  I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because I had memorized the multiplication tables and I know how to use logarithms and I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule. Today  though  those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator. Conversely  I at age    am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life. My family's first TV set in      had only three knobs that I quickly mastered  an on off switch  a volume knob  and a channel selector knob. Today  just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house  I have to operate a    button TV remote that utterly defeats me. I have to telephone my    year old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched    buttons. What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S.  and to make better use of their value  That's a huge problem. In my remaining four minutes today  I can offer just a few suggestions. One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high quality childcare to their grandchildren  if they choose to do it  as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full time caretakers of their children. Compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers  grandparents offer superior  motivated  experienced child care. They've already gained experience from raising their own children. They usually love their grandchildren  and are eager to spend time with them. Unlike other caregivers  grandparents don't quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby. A second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology. At the same time  older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change  but that could come back. For example  only Americans now in their   s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression  the experience of living through a world war  and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs. Most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things  but millions of older Americans do. Unfortunately  all of those terrible situations could come back. Even if they don't come back  we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like. Older people have that experience. Younger people don't. The remaining value of older people that I'll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do  there are other things that they can do better than younger people. A challenge for society is  to make use of those things that older people are better at doing. Some abilities  of course  decrease with age. Those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina  ambition  and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation  such as figuring out the structure of DNA  best left to scientists under the age of   . Conversely  valuable attributes that increase with age include experience  understanding of people and human relationships  ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way  and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases  such as economics and comparative history  best left to scholars over the age of   . Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising  administering  advising  strategizing  teaching  synthesizing  and devising long term plans. I've seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their   s    s    s and   s  who are still active as investment managers  farmers  lawyers and doctors. In short  many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern  big societies. Paradoxically nowadays  when we have more elderly people than ever before  living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before  old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before. The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society. We can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies. But what's true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well. Of course  I'm not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter gatherer lifestyle. There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small  traditional societies. To mention just a few examples  our lives are longer  materially much richer  and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies. But there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies  and perhaps to be learned from them. Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives  although materially poorer. Their children are more self confident  more independent  and more socially skilled than are our children. They think more realistically about dangers than we do. They almost never die of diabetes  heart disease  stroke  and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today. Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases  and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them. Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies. I hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as I found it to live in those societies. Thank you. What is so special about the human brain  Why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us  What does a human brain have or do that no other brain does  When I became interested in these questions about    years ago  scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of. Though it was based on very little evidence  many scientists thought that all mammalian brains  including the human brain  were made in the same way  with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain. This means that two brains of the same size  like these two  with a respectable     grams  should have similar numbers of neurons. Now  if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain  then the owners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities. And yet  one is a chimp  and the other is a cow. Now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it  but we eat them. I think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex  elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are. So this is a first indication that the  all brains are made the same way  scenario is not quite right. But let's play along. If all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes  larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains  and the larger the brain  the more cognitively able its owner should be. So the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able. And here comes the bad news  Our brain  not the largest one around. It seems quite vexing. Our brain weighs between  .  and  .  kilos  but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos  and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos  which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities. It must be really extraordinary  an exception to the rule. Theirs may be bigger  but ours is better  and it could be better  for example  in that it seems larger than it should be  with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies. So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body. That's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body. So the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes. Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are  so their brains should also be larger than ours  but instead it's the other way around. Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain. The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses. Although it weighs only two percent of the body  it alone uses    percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day. That's     calories out of a total of       calories  just to keep your brain working. So the human brain is larger than it should be  it uses much more energy than it should  so it's special. And this is where the story started to bother me. In biology  we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general  so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but not to us  Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way. Maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons. Maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest sized brain. Maybe the human brain  actually has the most neurons of any brain  regardless of its size  especially in the cerebral cortex. So this to me became the important question to answer  how many neurons does the human brain have  and how does that compare to other animals  Now  you may have heard or read somewhere that we have     billion neurons  so    years ago  I asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from. But nobody did. I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number  and I could never find it. It seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain  or in any other brain for that matter. So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain  and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup. It works like this  You take a brain  or parts of that brain  and you dissolve it in detergent  which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact  so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this  like a clear soup. This soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain. Now  the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup  you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid  so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution  you can count nuclei  and therefore tell how many cells that brain had. It's simple  it's straightforward  and it's really fast. So we've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far  and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way. Take rodents and primates  for instance  In larger rodent brains  the average size of the neuron increases  so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons. But primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger  which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain. The result is that a primate brain will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size  and the larger the brain  the larger this difference will be. Well  what about our brain then  We found that we have  on average     billion neurons     billion of which are in the cerebral cortex  and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning  and that    billion is the most neurons that any cortex has  I think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. But just as important is what the    billion neurons mean. Because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically  we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain. So  a rodent brain with    billion neurons would weigh    kilos. That's not possible. A brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight  and this impossible brain would go in the body of    tons. I don't think it looks like us. So this brings us to a very important conclusion already  which is that we are not rodents. The human brain is not a large rat brain. Compared to a rat  we might seem special  yes  but that's not a fair comparison to make  given that we know that we are not rodents. We are primates  so the correct comparison is to other primates. And there  if you do the math  you find that a generic primate with    billion neurons would have a brain of about  .  kilos  which seems just right  in a body of some    kilos  which in my case is exactly right  which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion  I am a primate. And all of you are primates. And so was Darwin. I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this. His brain  like ours  was made in the image of other primate brains. So the human brain may be remarkable  yes  but it is not special in its number of neurons. It is just a large primate brain. I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature. Why does it cost so much energy  then  Well  other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs  and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of  we could do the math. And it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same  an average of six calories  per billion neurons per day. So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple  linear function of its number of neurons  and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect. So the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons  and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal  the relative cost of our brain is large  but just because we're primates  not because we're special. Last question  then  how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons  and in particular  if great apes are larger than we are  why don't they have a larger brain  than we do  with more neurons  When we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain  I figured  maybe there's a simple reason. They just can't afford the energy for both a large body  and a large number of neurons. So we did the math. We calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods  and on the other hand  how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs  and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day. And what we found is that because neurons are so expensive  there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons. So a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most    billion neurons  but then its body cannot be any bigger than    kilos. To weigh any more than that  it has to give up neurons. So it's either a large body or a large number of neurons. When you eat like a primate  you can't afford both. One way out of this metabolic limitation would be to spend even more hours per day eating  but that gets dangerous  and past a certain point  it's just not possible. Gorillas and orangutans  for instance  afford about    billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating  and that seems to be about as much as they can do. Nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate. What about us  With our    billion neurons and    to    kilos of body mass  we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding  which is just not feasible. If we ate like a primate  we should not be here. How did we get here  then  Well  if our brain costs just as much energy as it should  and if we can't spend every waking hour of the day feeding  then the only alternative  really  is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods. And remarkably  that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago  when they invented cooking. To cook is to use fire to pre digest foods outside of your body. Cooked foods are softer  so they're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth  so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut  which makes them yield much more energy in much less time. So cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food  looking for food  and gobbling down food all day long. So because of cooking  what once was a major liability  this large  dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons  could now become a major asset  now that we could both afford  the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them. So I think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution  all of the while remaining just a primate brain. With this large brain now affordable by cooking  we went rapidly from raw foods to culture  agriculture  civilization  grocery stores  electricity  refrigerators  all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint. So what once was a solution now became the problem  and ironically  we look for the solution in raw food. So what is the human advantage  What is it that we have that no other animal has  My answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex  and I think that's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. And what is it that we do that no other animal does  and which I believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large  largest number of neurons in the cortex  In two words  we cook. No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do. And I think that's how we got to become human. Studying the human brain changed  the way I think about food. I now look at my kitchen  and I bow to it  and I thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans. Thank you very much. There is something you know about me  something very personal  and there is something I know about every one of you and that's very central to your concerns. There is something that we know about everyone we meet anywhere in the world  on the street  that is the very mainspring of whatever they do and whatever they put up with. And that is that all of us want to be happy. In this  we are all together. How we imagine our happiness  that differs from one another  but it's already a lot that we have all in common  that we want to be happy. Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection between happiness and gratefulness  Many people would say  well  that's very easy. When you are happy  you are grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people that are grateful  We all know quite a number of people who have everything that it would take to be happy  and they are not happy  because they want something else or they want more of the same. And we all know people who have lots of misfortune  misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have  and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why  Because they are grateful. So it is not happiness that makes us grateful. It's gratefulness that makes us happy. If you think it's happiness that makes you grateful  think again. It's gratefulness that makes you happy. Now  we can ask  what do we really mean by gratefulness  And how does it work  I appeal to your own experience. We all know from experience how it goes. We experience something that's valuable to us. Something is given to us that's valuable to us. And it's really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable  and it's a real gift. You haven't bought it. You haven't earned it. You haven't traded it in. You haven't worked for it. It's just given to you. And when these two things come together  something that's really valuable to me and I realize it's freely given  then gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart  happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That's how gratefulness happens. Now the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while. We cannot only have grateful experiences. We can be people who live gratefully. Grateful living  that is the thing. And how can we live gratefully  By experiencing  by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment  as we say. It's a gift. You haven't earned it. You haven't brought it about in any way. You have no way of assuring that there will be another moment given to you  and yet  that's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us  this moment  with all the opportunity that it contains. If we didn't have this present moment  we wouldn't have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything  and this moment is a gift. It's a given moment  as we say. Now  we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity. What you are really grateful for is the opportunity  not the thing that is given to you  because if that thing were somewhere else and you didn't have the opportunity to enjoy it  to do something with it  you wouldn't be grateful for it. Opportunity is the gift within every gift  and we have this saying  opportunity knocks only once. Well  think again. Every moment is a new gift  over and over again  and if you miss the opportunity of this moment  another moment is given to us  and another moment. We can avail ourselves of this opportunity  or we can miss it  and if we avail ourselves of the opportunity  it is the key to happiness. Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands. Moment by moment  we can be grateful for this gift. Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything  Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence  for war  for oppression  for exploitation. On the personal level  we cannot be grateful for the loss of a friend  for unfaithfulness  for bereavement. But I didn't say we can be grateful for everything. I said we can be grateful in every given moment for the opportunity  and even when we are confronted with something that is terribly difficult  we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity that is given to us. It isn't as bad as it might seem. Actually  when you look at it and experience it  you find that most of the time  what is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy  and we only miss it because we are rushing through life and we are not stopping to see the opportunity. But once in a while  something very difficult is given to us  and when this difficult thing occurs to us  it's a challenge to rise to that opportunity  and we can rise to it by learning something which is sometimes painful. Learning patience  for instance. We have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint  but is more like a marathon. That takes patience. That's difficult. It may be to stand up for your opinion  to stand up for your conviction. That's an opportunity that is given to us. To learn  to suffer  to stand up  all these opportunities are given to us  but they are opportunities  and those who avail themselves of those opportunities are the ones that we admire. They make something out of life. And those who fail get another opportunity. We always get another opportunity. That's the wonderful richness of life. So how can we find a method that will harness this  How can each one of us find a method for living gratefully  not just once in a while being grateful  but moment by moment to be grateful. How can we do it  It's a very simple method. It's so simple that it's actually what we were told as children when we learned to cross the street. Stop. Look. Go. That's all. But how often do we stop  We rush through life. We don't stop. We miss the opportunity because we don't stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs into our lives. When I was in Africa some years ago and then came back  I noticed water. In Africa where I was  I didn't have drinkable water. Every time I turned on the faucet  I was overwhelmed. Every time I clicked on the light  I was so grateful. It made me so happy. But after a while  this wears off. So I put little stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet  and every time I turned it on  water. So leave it up to your own imagination. You can find whatever works best for you  but you need stop signs in your life. And when you stop  then the next thing is to look. You look. You open your eyes. You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it  and that is what life is all about  to enjoy  to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts  our hearts for the opportunities  for the opportunities also to help others  to make others happy  because nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts to the opportunities  the opportunities invite us to do something  and that is the third. Stop  look  and then go  and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers to you in that present moment. Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy  but sometimes it's something more difficult. But whatever it is  if we take this opportunity  we go with it  we are creative  those are the creative people. And that little stop  look  go  is such a potent seed that it can revolutionize our world. Because we are at the present moment in the middle of a change of consciousness  and you will be surprised if you    I am always surprised when I hear how many times this word  gratefulness  and  gratitude  comes up. Everywhere you find it  a grateful airline  a restaurant gratefulness  a caf  gratefulness  a wine that is gratefulness. Yes  I have even come across a toilet paper whose brand is called  Thank You.  There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware how important this is and how this can change our world. It can change our world in immensely important ways  because if you're grateful  you're not fearful  and if you're not fearful  you're not violent. If you're grateful  you act out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity  and you are willing to share. If you are grateful  you are enjoying the differences between people  and you are respectful to everybody  and that changes this power pyramid under which we live. And it doesn't make for equality  but it makes for equal respect  and that is the important thing. The future of the world will be a network  not a pyramid turned upside down. The revolution of which I am speaking is a nonviolent revolution  and it's so revolutionary that it even revolutionizes the very concept of a revolution  because the normal revolution is one where the power pyramid is turned upside down and those who were on the bottom are now on the top and are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before. What we need is a networking of smaller groups  smaller and smaller groups who know one another  who interact with one another  and that is a grateful world. A grateful world is a world of joyful people. Grateful people are joyful people  and joyful people    the more and more joyful people there are  the more and more we'll have a joyful world. We have a network for grateful living  and it has mushroomed. We couldn't understand why it mushroomed. We have an opportunity for people to light a candle when they are grateful for something. And there have been    million candles lit in one decade. People are becoming aware that a grateful world is a happy world  and we all have the opportunity by the simple stop  look  go  to transform the world  to make it a happy place. And that is what I hope for us  and if this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same  stop  look  go. Thank you. I'm here today to talk about social change  not a new therapy or a new intervention or a new way of working with kids or something like that  but a new business model for social change  a new way of tackling the problem. In Britain     percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re offend again within a year. Now how many previous offenses do you think they have on average managed to commit  Forty three. And how many previous times do you think they've been in prison  Seven. So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice  and we said to the Ministry of Justice  what's it worth to you if fewer of these guys re offend  It's got to be worth something  right  I mean  there's prison costs  there's police costs  there's court costs  all these things that you're spending money on to deal with these guys. What's it worth  Now  of course  we care about the social value. Social Finance  the organization I helped set up  cares about social stuff. But we wanted to make the economic case  because if we could make the economic case  then the value of doing this  would be completely compelling. And if we can agree on both a value and a way of measuring whether we've been successful at reducing that re offending  then we can do something we think rather interesting. The idea is called the social impact bond. Now  the social impact bond is simply saying  if we can get the government to agree  that we can create a contract where they only pay if it worked. So that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn't work  which for still quite a lot of bits of government  that's a serious issue. Now  many of you may have noticed there's a problem at this point  and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened. So we have to raise some money. We use the contract to raise money from socially motivated investors. Socially motivated investors  there's an interesting idea  right  But actually  there's a lot of people who  if they're given the chance  would love to invest in something that does social good. And here's the opportunity. Do you want to also help government find whether there's a better economic model  not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re offend and putting them back in again  but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims  So we find some investors  and they pay for a set of services  and if those services are successful  then they improve outcomes  and with those measured reductions in re offending  government saves money  and with those savings  they can pay outcomes. And the investors do not just get their money back  but they make a return. So in March       we signed the first social impact bond with the Ministry of Justice around Peterborough Prison. It was to work with       offenders split into three cohorts of       each. Now  each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison. They've got to have a year to commit their crimes  six months to get through the court system  and then they would be compared to a group taken from the police national computer  as similar as possible  and we would get paid providing we achieved a hurdle rate of    percent reduction  for every conviction event that didn't happen. So we get paid for crimes saved. Now if we achieved that    percent reduction across all three cohorts  then the investors get a seven and a half percent annualized return on their investment  and if we do better than that  they can get up to    percent annualized return on their investment  which is okay. So everyone wins here  right  The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works. Investors get two opportunities  for the first time  they can invest in social change. Also  they make a reasonable return  and they also know that first investors in these kinds of things  they're going to have to believers. They're going to have to care in the social program  but if this builds a track record over five or    years  then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product. The service providers  well  for the first time  they've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they're doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they're doing over five or six years  not just one or two as often happens at the moment. Society wins  fewer crimes  fewer victims. Now  the offenders  they also benefit. Instead of just coming out of the prison with    pounds in their pocket  half of them not knowing where they're spending their first night out of jail  actually  someone meets them in prison  learns about their issues  meets them at the gate  takes them through to somewhere to stay  connects them to benefits  connects them to employment  drug rehabilitation  mental health  whatever's needed. So let's think of another example  working with children in care. Social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people. So children in the state care tend to do very badly. Only    percent achieve a reasonable level of five GCSEs at     against    percent of the wider population. More troublingly     percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care. And even more worryingly  and this is a Home Office statistic     percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care. The state is not a great parent. But there are great programs for adolescents who are on the edge of care  and    percent of kids going into care are adolescents. So we set up a program with Essex County Council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those families with adolescents on the edge of the care system. Essex only pays in the event that it's saving them care costs. Investors have put in  .  million pounds. That program started last month. Others  around homelessness in London  around youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country. There are now    social impact bonds in Britain  and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world. So David Cameron's put    million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea. Obama has suggested     million dollars in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward  and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest. So what's caused this excitement  Why is this so different for people  Well  the first piece  which we've talked about  is innovation. It enables testing of new ideas in a way that's less difficult for everybody. The second piece it brings is rigor. By working to outcomes  people really have to test and bring data into the situation that one's dealing with. So taking Peterborough as an example  we add case management across all of the different organizations that we're working with so they know what actually has been done with different prisoners  and at the same time they learn from the Ministry of Justice  and we learn  because we pushed for the data  what actually happens  whether they get re arrested or not. And we learn and adapt the program accordingly. And this leads to the third element  which is new  and that's flexibility. Because normal contracting for things  when you're spending government money  you're spending our money  tax money  and the people who are in charge  of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it. Now any entrepreneur in the room knows that version  .   the business plan  is not the one that generally works. So when you're trying to do something like this  you need the flexibility to adapt the program. And again  in Peterborough  we started off with a program  but we also collected data  and over the period of time  we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements  so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term  greater engagement from the prisoners  longer term engagement as well. The last element is partnership. There is  at the moment  a stale  debate going on very often  state's better  public sector's better  private sector's better  social sector's better  for a lot of these programs. Actually  for creating social change  we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work. And this creates a structure through which they can combine. So where does this leave us  This leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change. We've met thousands  possibly millions of people  who want the opportunity to invest in social change. We've met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences. With this kind of model  we can help bring them together. Thank you. We have a global health challenge in our hands today  and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs is too costly  takes far too long  and it fails more often than it succeeds. It really just isn't working  and that means that patients that badly need new therapies are not getting them  and diseases are going untreated. We seem to be spending more and more money. So for every billion dollars we spend in R D  we're getting less drugs approved into the market. More money  less drugs. Hmm. So what's going on here  Well  there's a multitude of factors at play  but I think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug is going to work  whether it has efficacy  or whether it's going to be safe before we get it into human clinical trials  are failing us. They're not predicting what's going to happen in humans. And we have two main tools available at our disposal. They are cells in dishes and animal testing. Now let's talk about the first one  cells in dishes. So  cells are happily functioning in our bodies. We take them and rip them out of their native environment  throw them in one of these dishes  and expect them to work. Guess what. They don't. They don't like that environment because it's nothing like what they have in the body. What about animal testing  Well  animals do and can provide extremely useful information. They teach us about what happens in the complex organism. We learn more about the biology itself. However  more often than not  animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they're treated with a particular drug. So we need better tools. We need human cells  but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body. Our bodies are dynamic environments. We're in constant motion. Our cells experience that. They're in dynamic environments in our body. They're under constant mechanical forces. So if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies  we need to become cell architects. We need to design  build and engineer a home away from home for the cells. And at the Wyss Institute  we've done just that. We call it an organ on a chip. And I have one right here. It's beautiful  isn't it  But it's pretty incredible. Right here in my hand is a breathing  living human lung on a chip. And it's not just beautiful. It can do a tremendous amount of things. We have living cells in that little chip  cells that are in a dynamic environment interacting with different cell types. There's been many people trying to grow cells in the lab. They've tried many different approaches. They've even tried to grow little mini organs in the lab. We're not trying to do that here. We're simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip the smallest functional unit that represents the biochemistry  the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies. So how does it work  Let me show you. We use techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to make these structures at a scale relevant to both the cells and their environment. We have three fluidic channels. In the center  we have a porous  flexible membrane on which we can add human cells from  say  our lungs  and then underneath  they had capillary cells  the cells in our blood vessels. And we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip that stretch and contract the membrane  so the cells experience the same mechanical forces that they did when we breathe. And they experience them how they did in the body. There's air flowing through the top channel  and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel. Now the chip is really beautiful  but what can we do with it  We can get incredible functionality inside these little chips. Let me show you. We could  for example  mimic infection  where we add bacterial cells into the lung. then we can add human white blood cells. White blood cells are our body's defense against bacterial invaders  and when they sense this inflammation due to infection  they will enter from the blood into the lung and engulf the bacteria. Well now you're going to see this happening live in an actual human lung on a chip. We've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through  and when they detect that infection  they begin to stick. They stick  and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel. And you can see here  we can actually visualize a single white blood cell. It sticks  it wiggles its way through between the cell layers  through the pore  comes out on the other side of the membrane  and right there  it's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green. In that tiny chip  you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection. It's the way we respond to    an immune response. It's pretty exciting. Now I want to share this picture with you  not just because it's so beautiful  but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips. It tells us that these cells from the small airways in our lungs  actually have these hairlike structures that you would expect to see in the lung. These structures are called cilia  and they actually move the mucus out of the lung. Yeah. Mucus. Yuck. But mucus is actually very important. Mucus traps particulates  viruses  potential allergens  and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out. When they get damaged  say  by cigarette smoke for example  they don't work properly  and they can't clear that mucus out. And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis. Cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis. But now  with the functionality that we get in these chips  we can begin to look for potential new treatments. We didn't stop with the lung on a chip. We have a gut on a chip. You can see one right here. And we've put intestinal human cells in a gut on a chip  and they're under constant peristaltic motion  this trickling flow through the cells  and we can mimic many of the functions that you actually would expect to see in the human intestine. Now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. This is a disease that affects a large number of individuals. It's really debilitating  and there aren't really many good treatments for it. Now we have a whole pipeline of different organ chips that we are currently working on in our labs. Now  the true power of this technology  however  really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them. There's fluid flowing across these cells  so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips together to form what we call a virtual human on a chip. Now we're really getting excited. We're not going to ever recreate  a whole human in these chips  but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what's going to happen in humans. For example  now we can begin to explore what happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug. Those of you like me who have asthma  when you take your inhaler  we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs  how it enters the body  how it might affect  say  your heart. Does it change the beating of your heart  Does it have a toxicity  Does it get cleared by the liver  Is it metabolized in the liver  Is it excreted in your kidneys  We can begin to study the dynamic response of the body to a drug. This could really revolutionize and be a game changer for not only the pharmaceutical industry  but a whole host of different industries  including the cosmetics industry. We can potentially use the skin on a chip that we're currently developing in the lab to test whether the ingredients in those products that you're using are actually  safe to put on your skin without the need for animal testing. We could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment  such as chemicals in regular household cleaners. We could also use the organs on chips for applications in bioterrorism or radiation exposure. We could use them to learn more about diseases such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as SARS. Organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future. Right now  the average participant in a clinical trial is that  average. Tends to be middle aged  tends to be female. You won't find many clinical trials in which children are involved  yet every day  we give children medications  and the only safety data we have on that drug is one that we obtained from adults. Children are not adults. They may not respond in the same way adults do. There are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead to at risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction. Now imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations  put them on chips  and create populations on a chip. This could really change the way we do clinical trials. And this is the team and the people that are doing this. We have engineers  we have cell biologists  we have clinicians  all working together. We're really seeing something quite incredible at the Wyss Institute. It's really a convergence of disciplines  where biology is influencing the way we design  the way we engineer  the way we build. It's pretty exciting. We're establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with a company that has expertise in large scale digital manufacturing. They're going to help us make  instead of one of these  millions of these chips  so that we can get them into the hands of as many researchers as possible. And this is key to the potential of that technology. Now let me show you our instrument. This is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab  and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we're going to require in order to link    or more organ chips together. It does something else that's very important. It creates an easy user interface. So a cell biologist like me can come in  take a chip  put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there  put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a C.D.  and away you go. Plug and play. Easy. Now  let's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if I could take your stem cells and put them on a chip  or your stem cells and put them on a chip. It would be a personalized chip just for you. Now all of us in here are individuals  and those individual differences mean that we could react very differently and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs. I myself  a couple of years back  had a really bad headache  just couldn't shake it  thought    Well  I'll try something different.  I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later  I was on my way to the emergency room with a full blown asthma attack. Now  obviously it wasn't fatal  but unfortunately  some of these adverse drug reactions can be fatal. So how do we prevent them  Well  we could imagine one day having Geraldine on a chip  having Danielle on a chip  having you on a chip. Personalized medicine. Thank you. So when I do my job  people hate me. In fact  the better I do my job  the more people hate me. And no  I'm not a meter maid  and I'm not an undertaker. I am a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News.  Applause  So y'all heard that  right  Just to make sure  right  I am a gay talking head on Fox News. I am going to tell you how I do it and the most important thing I've learned. So I go on television. I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in  in some cases  who don't want me and people like me to even exist. It's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids  with a live television audience of millions. It's totally almost just like that. And that's just on air. The hate mail I get is unbelievable. Last week alone  I got     pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than I can even count. I was called an idiot  a traitor  a scourge  a cunt  and an ugly man  and that was just in one email. So what have I realized  being on the receiving end of all this ugliness  Well  my biggest takeaway is that for decades  we've been focused on political correctness  but what matters more is emotional correctness. Let me give you a small example. I don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't. I care about two things. One  I care that you spell it right. Just quick refresher  it's D Y K E. You'd totally be surprised. And second  I don't care about the word  I care about how you use it. Are you being friendly  Are you just being naive  Or do you really want to hurt me personally  Emotional correctness is the tone  the feeling  how we say what we say  the respect and compassion we show one another. And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data. Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct. So when I first went to go work at Fox News  true confession  I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle dragging. That  by the way  in case you're paying attention  is not emotionally correct. But liberals on my side  we can be self righteous  we can be condescending  we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with us. In other words  we can be politically right but emotionally wrong. And incidentally  that means that people don't like us. Right  Now here's the kicker. Conservatives are really nice. I mean  not all of them  and not the ones who send me hate mail  but you would be surprised. Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met. He spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates  and I know that if I ever had a problem  he would do anything he could to help. Now  I think Sean Hannity is    percent politically wrong  but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive  and that's why people listen to him. Because you can't get anyone to agree with you if they don't even listen to you first. We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements  and if we can start to find compassion for one another  then we have a shot at building common ground. It actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here  but when you try to put it in practice  it's really powerful. So someone who says they hate immigrants  I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they've always known. Or someone who says they don't like teachers' unions  I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter  and they're just looking for someone to blame. Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us. That is emotional correctness. I'm not saying it's easy. An average of  like   .  times per day I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities. This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political spiritual practice for me  and I ain't the Dalai Lama. I'm not perfect  but what I am is optimistic  because I don't just get hate mail. I get a lot of really nice letters  lots of them. And one of my all time favorites begins   I am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic  but I'm a big fan of you as a person.  Now this guy doesn't agree with me  yet. But he's listening  not because of what I said  but because of how I said it  and somehow  even though we've never met  we've managed to form a connection. That's emotional correctness  and that's how we start the conversations that really lead to change. Thank you. So this video was taken at Aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of Key Largo  about    feet below the surface. NASA uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts  and last year  they invited us along for the ride. All the footage was taken from our open ROV  which is a robot that we built in our garage. So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle  which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra thin tether back to the computer topside. It's open source  meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online  allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design. It's built with mostly off the shelf parts and costs about       times cheaper than the ROVs James Cameron used to explore the Titanic. So ROVs aren't new. They've been around for decades. Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans. Oil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction. What we've built isn't unique. It's how we've built it that's really unique. So I want to give you a quick story of how it got started. So a few years ago  my friend Eric and I decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierras. We had heard this story about lost gold from a Gold Rush era robbery  and we wanted to go up there. Unfortunately  we didn't have any money and we didn't have any tools to do it. So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot  but we didn't have all the parts figured out  so we did what anybody would do in our situation  we asked the Internet for help. More specifically  we created this website  openROV.com  and shared  our intentions and our plans For the first few months  it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums  but pretty soon  we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists  and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do. We kept working on it. We learned a lot. We kept prototyping  and eventually  we decided we wanted to go  to the cave. We were ready. So about that time  our little expedition became quite a story  and it got picked up in The New York Times. And we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open ROV themselves. So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter  and when we did  we raised our funding goal in about two hours  and all of a sudden   had this money to make these kits. But then we had to learn how to make them. I mean  we had to learn small batch manufacturing. So we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation. But we were able to do it  we got all the kits made  thanks a lot to TechShop  which was a big help to us  and we shipped these kits all over the world just before Christmas of last year  so it was just a few months ago. But we're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world  including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica. We've also learned the penguins love robots. So we're still publishing all the designs online  encouraging anyone to build these themselves. That's the only way that we could have done this. By being open source  we've created this distributed R D network  and we're moving faster than any venture backed counterpart. But the actual robot is really only half the story. The real potential  the long term potential  is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe. What can we discover when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas  So you're probably all wondering  the cave. Did you find the gold  Well  we didn't find any gold  but we decided that what we found was much more valuable. It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration. It's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world  but something that we're all participating in. It's an underwater world we're all exploring together. Thank you. Mobility in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge  because different from health or education or housing  it tends to get worse as societies become richer. Clearly  a unsustainable model. Mobility  as most other developing country problems  more than a matter of money or technology  is a matter of equality  equity. The great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see  for example  that in terms of transport  an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars  but rather one where even the rich use public transport. Or bicycles  For example  in Amsterdam  more than    percent of the population uses bicycles  despite the fact that the Netherlands has a higher income per capita than the United States. There is a conflict in developing world cities for money  for government investment. If more money is invested in highways  of course there is less money for housing  for schools  for hospitals  and also there is a conflict for space. There is a conflict for space between those with cars and those without them. Most of us accept today that private property and a market economy is the best way to manage most of society's resources. However  there is a problem with that  that market economy needs inequality of income in order to work. Some people must make more money  some others less. Some companies succeed. Others fail. Then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy  I would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities. The first one is equality of quality of life  especially for children  that all children should have  beyond the obvious health and education  access to green spaces  to sports facilities  to swimming pools  to music lessons. And the second kind of equality is one which we could call  democratic equality.  The first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law. That is not just poetry. It's a very powerful principle. For example  if that is true  a bus with    passengers has a right to    times more road space than a car with one. We have been so used to inequality  sometimes  that it's before our noses and we do not see it. Less than     years ago  women could not vote  and it seemed normal  in the same way that it seems normal today to see a bus in traffic. In fact  when I became mayor  applying that democratic principle that public good prevails over private interest  that a bus with     people has a right to     times more road space than a car  we implemented a mass transit system based on buses in exclusive lanes. We called it TransMilenio  in order to make buses sexier. And one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol  because as buses zoom by  expensive cars stuck in traffic  it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work. In fact  it's not just a matter of equity. It doesn't take Ph.D.'s. A committee of    year old children would find out in    minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses. In fact  buses are not sexy  but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing developing cities. They also have great capacity. For example  this system in Guangzhou is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in China  except for one line in Beijing  at a fraction of the cost. We fought not just for space for buses  but we fought for space for people  and that was even more difficult. Cities are human habitats  and we humans are pedestrians. Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly or deer need to run  we need to walk. There is a really enormous conflict  when we are talking about developing country cities  between pedestrians and cars. Here  what you see is a picture that shows insufficient democracy. What this shows is that people who walk are third class citizens while those who go in cars are first class citizens. In terms of transport infrastructure  what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities is not highways or subways but quality sidewalks. Here they made a flyover  probably very useless  and they forgot to make a sidewalk. This is prevailing all over the world. Not even schoolchildren are more important than cars. In my city of Bogot   we fought a very difficult battle in order to take space from cars  which had been parking on sidewalks for decades  in order to make space for people that should reflect dignity of human beings  and to make space for protected bikeways. First of all  I had black hair before that. And I was almost impeached in the process. It is a very difficult battle. However  it was possible  finally  after very difficult battles  to make a city that would reflect some respect for human dignity  that would show that those who walk are equally important to those who have cars. Indeed  a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city  which is road space. A city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space. How to distribute it between pedestrians  bicycles  public transport and cars  This is not a technological issue  and we should remember that in no constitution parking is a constitutional right when we make that distribution. We also built  and this was    years ago  before there were bikeways in New York or in Paris or in London  it was a very difficult battle as well  more than     kilometers of protected bicycle ways. I don't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature. They are a right  just as sidewalks are  unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility  without the risk of getting killed. And just as busways are  protected bikeways also are a powerful symbol of democracy  because they show that a citizen on a     bicycle is equally important to one in a         car. And we are living in a unique moment in history. In the next    years  more than half of those cities which will exist in the year      will be built. In many developing country cities  more than    and    percent of the city which will exist in      will be built over the next four or five decades. But this is not just a matter for developing country cities. In the United States  for example  more than    million new homes must be built over the next    or    years. That's more than all the homes that today exist in Britain  France and Canada put together. And I believe that our cities today have severe flaws  and that different  better ones could be built. What is wrong with our cities today  Well  for example  if we tell any three year old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world today   Watch out  a car   the child will jump in fright  and with a very good reason  because there are more than        children who are killed by cars every year in the world. We have had cities for       years  and children could walk out of home and play. In fact  only very recently  towards       there were no cars. Cars have been here for really less than     years. They completely changed cities. In       for example  nobody was killed by cars in the United States. Only    years later  between      and       almost         people were killed by cars in the United States. Only in       almost       children were killed by cars in the United States. So we could make different cities  cities that will give more priority to human beings than to cars  that will give more public space to human beings than to cars  cities which show great respect for those most vulnerable citizens  such as children or the elderly. I will propose to you a couple of ingredients which I think would make cities much better  and it would be very simple to implement them in the new cities which are only being created. Hundreds of kilometers of greenways criss crossing cities in all directions. Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces. They could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways  sort of bicycle highways  and I would invite you to imagine the following  a city in which every other street would be a street only for pedestrians and bicycles. In new cities which are going to be built  this would not be particularly difficult. When I was mayor of Bogot   in only three years  we were able to create    kilometers  in one of the most dense cities in the world  of these bicycle highways. And this changes the way people live  move  enjoy the city. In this picture  you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods  we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street  and the cars still in the mud. Of course  I would love to pave this street for cars. But what do we do first  Ninety nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don't have cars. But you see  when a city is only being created  it's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure. Then the city grows around it. And of course this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better if we just create it  and it changes the way of life. And the second ingredient  which would solve mobility  that very difficult challenge in developing countries  in a very low cost and simple way  would be to have hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses  buses and bicycles and pedestrians. This would be  again  a very low cost solution if implemented from the start  low cost  pleasant transit with natural sunlight. But unfortunately  reality is not as good as my dreams. Because of private property of land and high land prices  all developing country cities have a large problem of slums. In my country of Colombia  almost half the homes in cities initially were illegal developments. And of course it's very difficult to have mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments. But even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places  very far from the city centers where it's impossible to provide low cost  high frequency public transport. As a Latin American  and Latin America was the most recently organized region in the world  I would recommend  respectfully  passionately  to those countries which are yet to urbanize    Latin America went from    percent urban in      to    percent urban in         I would recommend Asian and African countries which are yet to urbanize  such as India which is only    percent urban now  that governments should acquire all land around cities. In this way  their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces  with the parks  with the greenways  with the busways. The cities we are going to build over the next    years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the future. What a fantastic opportunity for leaders and many young leaders to come  especially in the developing countries. They can create a much happier life for billions towards the future. I am sure  I am optimistic  that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams. I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart  and so just before I get going  I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago. Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom. And so this talk is going to be for him. I grew up in wonder. I grew up amongst those animals. I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve. It's a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations. Now for as long as I can remember  my job has been to take people out into nature  and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering. Africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories  and so what I have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories  stories about heroes of heart. Now my stories are not the stories that you'll hear on the news  and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place  I also know it to be a place where people  animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world. When I was nine years old  President Mandela came to stay with my family. He had just been released from his    years of incarceration  and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status. Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye  and it's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi. But it was a defining time for me as a young boy. I would take him breakfast in bed  and then  in an old track suit and slippers  he would go for a walk around the garden. At night  I would sit with my family around the snowy  bunny eared TV  and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly. He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa  one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity. Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think  to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa  peace  reconciliation  harmony. Through this act of immense open heartedness  he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call  ubuntu.  Ubuntu  I am because of you. Or  people are not people without other people. It's not a new idea or value but it's one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on. In fact  it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa  we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others. Ubuntu is at play right now. You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am. Without you  I'm just a guy talking to an empty room  and I spent a lot of time last week doing that  and it's not the same as this. If Mandela was the national and international embodiment  then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man  Solly Mhlongo. Solly was born under a tree    kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique. He would never have a lot of money  but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet. Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle. Now  I can tell you  I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle  but it makes for  ber resourcefulness. The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks. Where he had learned to do that out in the bush I have no idea  but he could do it. He then moved across into what we called the habitat team. These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well being. He fixed roads  he mended wetlands  he did some anti poaching. And then one day we were out together  and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked. And it was an old track  but for fun he turned and he began to follow it  and I tell you  I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a Ph.D. level tracker. If you drove past Solly somewhere out on the reserve  you look up in your rearview mirror  you'd see he'd stopped the car        meters down the road just in case you need help with something. The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said   Solly  you are pathologically helpful.  When I started professionally guiding people out into this environment  Solly was my tracker. We worked together as a team. And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast  and they said to Solly  on the side  they said   Before we even go out to see lions and leopards  we want to see where you live.  So we took them up to his house  and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly's wife  who was learning English  was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying   Hello  I love you. Welcome  I love you.   Laughter  And there was something so beautifully African about it to me  this small house with a huge heart in it. Now on the day that Solly saved my life  he was already my hero. It was a hot day  and we found ourselves down by the river. Because of the heat  I took my shoes off  and I rolled up my pants  and I walked into the water. Solly remained on the bank. The water was clear running over sand  and we turned and we began to make our way upstream. And a few meters ahead of us  there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank  and its branches were touching the water  and it was shadowy. And if had been a horror movie  people in the audience would have started saying   Don't go in there. Don't go in there.   Laughter  And of course  the crocodile was in the shadows. Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite. Wham  It hits me by my right leg. It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up. I'm able to grab a branch. It's shaking me violently. It's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you  and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that. Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble. He turns. He begins to make his way to me. The croc again continues to shake me. It goes to bite me a second time. I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream. As it bites the second time  I kick. My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out. I pull myself up into the branches  and as I come out of the water  I look over my shoulder. My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description. The bone is cracked. The meat is torn up. I make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again. As I come out of the water  Solly arrives at a deep section  a channel between us. He knows  he sees the state of my leg  he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile  and I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second. He comes straight into the channel. He wades in to above his waist. He gets to me. He grabs me. I'm still in a vulnerable position. He picks me and puts me on his shoulder. This is the other thing about Solly  he's freakishly strong. He turns. He walks me up the bank. He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off. He wraps it around my leg  picks me up a second time  walks me to a vehicle  and he's able to get me to medical attention. And I survive. Now    Applause  Now I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you  but for Solly  it was as natural as breathing. And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa. In a more collective society  we realize from the inside that our own well being is deeply tied to the well being of others. Danger is shared. Pain is shared. Joy is shared. Achievement is shared. Houses are shared. Food is shared. Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share  and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value  his animated  empathetic action in every moment. Now although the root word is about people  I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people. And then I met this young lady. Her name was Elvis. In fact  Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance. She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis. She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route. When I first saw her  I thought she would be dead in a matter of days. And yet  for the next five years she returned in the winter months. And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track. It looked like an inverted bracket  and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow  and then we would come around the corner  and there she would be with her herd. And that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her  it was this sense of kinship. And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals. And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving. And then one day we came across them at this small water hole. It was sort of a hollow in the ground. And I watched as the matriarch drank  and then she turned in that  beautiful slow motion of elephants  looks like the arm in motion  and she began to make her way up the steep bank. The rest of the herd turned and began to follow. And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill. She got visibly    ears came forward  she had a full go of it and halfway up  her legs gave way  and she fell backwards. She attempted it a second time  and again  halfway up  she fell backwards. And on the third attempt  an amazing thing happened. Halfway up the bank  a young teenage elephant came in behind her  and he propped his trunk underneath her  and he began to shovel her up the bank. And it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant. The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth  and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground. And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant. What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu  and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild  we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us. And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet. If Africa has a gift to share  it's a gift of a more collective society. And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea  what I see is the essence of that value being invented here. Thank you. Pat Mitchell  So Boyd  we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today  and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world. But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts  because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session. Boyd Varty  Well thanks  Pat. I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on. He was suffering. And so of course there's the mixed emotions. But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about. And she was like   Well  it'll be about you.  I mean  that's just incredible humility. He was the father of our nation and we've got a road to walk in South Africa. And everything  they used to call it Madiba magic. You know  he used to go to a rugby match and we would win. Anywhere he went  things went well. But I think that magic will be with us  and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for. And so that's what I'm going to try and do  and that's what people all over  South Africa are trying to do. PM  And that's what you've done today. BV  Oh  thank you. PM  Thank you. BV  Thank you. Thanks very much. I would like to show you how architecture has helped to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope. I am a native of Burkina Faso. According to the World Bank  Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world  but what does it look like to grow up in a place like that  I am an example of that. I was born in a little village called Gando. In Gando  there was no electricity  no access to clean drinking water  and no school. But my father wanted me to learn how to read and write. For this reason  I had to leave my family when I was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family. In this place I sat in a class like that with more than     other kids  and for six years. In this time  it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate died. Today  not so much has changed. There is still no electricity in my village. People still are dying in Burkina Faso  and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem. I had luck. I was lucky  because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that. But I was lucky. I had a scholarship. I could go to Germany to study. So now  I suppose  I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today. From Gando  my home village in Burkina Faso  to Berlin in Germany to become an architect is a big  big step. But what to do with this privilege  Since I was a student  I wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in Gando. I just wanted to use my skills and build a school. But how do you do it when you're still a student and you don't have money  Oh yes  I started to make drawings and asked for money. Fundraising was not an easy task. I even asked my classmates to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes  but to sponsor my school project. In real wonder  two years later  I was able to collect        U.S. dollars. When I came home to Gando to bring the good news  my people were over the moon  but when they realized that I was planning to use clay  they were shocked.  A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season  and Francis wants us to use it and build a school. Is this the reason why he spent so much time in Europe studying instead of working in the field with us   My people build all the time with clay  but they don't see any innovation with mud. So I had to convince everybody. I started to speak with the community  and I could convince everybody  and we could start to work. And the women  the men  everybody from the village  was part of this building process. I was allowed to use even traditional techniques. So clay floor for example  the young men come and stand like that  beating  hours for hours  and then their mothers came  and they are beating in this position  for hours  giving water and beating. And then the polishers come. They start polishing it with a stone for hours. And then you have this result  very fine  like a baby bottom. It's not photoshopped.  Laughter  This is the school  built with the community. The walls are totally made out of compressed clay blocks from Gando. The roof structure is made with cheap steel bars normally hiding inside concrete. And the classroom  the ceiling is made out of both of them used together. In this school  there was a simple idea  to create comfort in a classroom. Don't forget  it can be    degrees in Burkina Faso  so with simple ventilation  I wanted to make the classroom good for teaching and learning. And this is the project today     years old  still in best condition. And the kids  they love it. And for me and my community  this project was a huge success. It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Gando. So I could do a lot of projects  and here I am going to share with you only three of them. The first one is the school extension  of course. How do you explain drawings and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write  I started to build a prototype like that. The innovation was to build a clay vault. So then  I jumped on the top like that  with my team  and it works. The community is looking. It still works. So we can build.  Laughter  And we kept building  and that is the result. The kids are happy  and they love it. The community is very proud. We made it. And even animals  like these donkeys  love our buildings. The next project is the library in Gando. And see now  we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings  but we often don't have so much material. Something we have in Gando are clay pots. We wanted to use them to create openings. So we just bring them like you can see to the building site. we start cutting them  and then we place them on top of the roof before we pour the concrete  and you have this result. The openings are letting the hot air out and light in. Very simple. My most recent project in Gando is a high school project. I would like to share with you this. The innovation in this project is to cast mud like you cast concrete. How do you cast mud  We start making a lot of mortars  like you can see  and when everything is ready  when you know what is the best recipe and the best form  you start working with the community. And sometimes I can leave. They will do it themselves. I came to speak to you like that. Another factor in Gando is rain. When the rains come  we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain. Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne Claude. It is simply how we protect our walls. The rain in Burkina comes very fast  and after that  you have floods everywhere in the country. But for us  the rain is good. It brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build. We just wait for the rain to go. We take the sand  we mix it with clay  and we keep building. That is it. The Gando project was always connected to training the people  because I just wanted  one day when I fall down and die  that at least one person from Gando keeps doing this work. But you will be surprised. I'm still alive. And my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves. Usually  for a young man from Gando to earn money  you have to leave the country to the city  sometimes leave the country and some never come back  making the community weaker. But now they can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family. There's a new quality in this work. Yes  you know it. I have won a lot of awards through this work. For sure  it has opened opportunities. I have become myself known. But the reason why I do what I do is my community. When I was a kid  I was going to school  I was coming back every holiday to Gando. By the end of every holidays  I had to say goodbye to the community  going from one compound to another one. All women in Gando will open their clothes like that and give me the last penny. In my culture  this is a symbol of deep affection. As a seven year old guy  I was impressed. I just asked my mother one day   Why do all these women love me so much   She just answered   They are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community.  I hope now that I was able to make my community proud through this work  and I hope I was able to prove you the power of community  and to show you that architecture can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future. Merci beaucoup.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  So how many of you have ever been in a cave before  Okay  a few of you. When you think of a cave  most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock  and in fact  that's how most caves are. Around this half of the country  most of your caves are made of limestone. Back where I'm from  most of our  caves are made of lava rock  because we have a lot of volcanoes out there. But the caves I want to share  with you today are made completely of ice  specifically glacier ice that's formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of Oregon  called Mount Hood. Now Mount Hood's only  one hour's drive from Portland  the largest city in Oregon  where over two million people live. Now the most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to find a new cave and be the first human to ever go into it. The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave. Now these days  with so many people hiking around  it's pretty hard to find a new cave  so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of Oregon's largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before. It was kind of like being an astronaut  because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone to before. So what is a glacier  Well  those of you who have ever seen or touched snow  you know that it's really light  because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together  and it's mostly air. If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball  it gets really small  hard and dense. Well  on a mountain like Hood  where it snows over    feet a year  it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard blue ice. Now each year  more and more ice stacks up on top of it  and eventually it gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight  forming a slow moving river of ice. When ice packed like that starts to move  we call it a glacier  and we give it a name. The name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the Sandy Glacier. Now each year  as new snow lands on the glacier  it melts in the summer sun  and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice  and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier  forming big networks of caves  sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock. Now the crazy thing about glacier caves is that each year  new tunnels form. Different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave. Warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down  and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up  gets into the cave  and melts the ceilings back taller and taller. But the weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving  because it's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that's slowly sliding down the mountain. Now this is Brent McGregor  my cave exploration partner. He and I have both been exploring caves a long time and we've been climbing mountains a long time  but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before. Back in       Brent saw a YouTube video of a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves. There were no GPS coordinates for it  and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the Sandy Glacier. So in July of that year  we went out on the glacier  and we found a big crack in the ice. We had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole. This is me looking into the entrance crevasse. At the end of this hole  we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice. We followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end  and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three dimensional map of the cave on our way back out. So how do you map a cave  Well  cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes  going to overlapping levels. To make a cave map  you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave  and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations. Then you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings. Now those of you taking trigonometry  that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there. In fact  the more I mapped and studied caves  the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be. So when you're done surveying  you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well  and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this  and it'll show you both a bird's eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage  kind of like an ant farm view. We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow. Now later this summer  as more snow melted off the glacier  we found more caves  and we realized they were all connected. Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon  Brent discovered this new cave not very far away. The inside of it was coated with ice  so we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons so we could walk around without slipping. This cave was amazing. The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice and lighting it all up. And we couldn't understand why this cave was so much colder than Snow Dragon until we got to the end and we found out why. There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going     feet straight up to the surface of the glacier. Cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave  freezing everything inside of it. And we were so excited about finding this new pit  we actually came back in January the following year so we could be the first ones to explore it. It was so cold outside  we actually had to sleep inside the cave. There's our camp on the left side  of this entrance room. The next morning  we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier  where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit for the very first time. Brent named this cave Pure Imagination  I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined. So besides really cool ice  what else is inside these caves  Well not too much lives in them  because they're so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year. But there are some really cool things in there. There's weird bacteria living in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice. In fact  this past summer  scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles  tiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions  might be living under the ice  kind of like what they hope to find on the polar icecaps of Mars someday. Another really cool things is that  as seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die  they get buried in the snow and gradually become part of the glacier  sinking deeper and deeper into the ice. As these caves form and melt  their way up into the ice  they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor  where we end up finding them. For example  this is a noble fir seed we found. It's been frozen in the ice for over     years  and it's just now starting to sprout. This mallard duck feather was found over       feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave. This duck died on the surface of the glacier long  long ago  and its feathers have finally made it down through over     feet of ice before falling inside the cave. And this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of Snow Dragon. Even now  Brent and I find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were  essentially in our own backyard  hidden away  just waiting to be found. Like I said earlier  the idea of discovering in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something  you can only do with space travel now  but that's not true. Every year  new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before. So it's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself. You just have to be willing to look and go where people don't often go and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it  because it might be in your own backyard. Thank you very much. I have a question  Who here remembers when they first realized they were going to die  I do. I was a young boy  and my grandfather had just died  and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened. What did it mean that he was dead  Where had he gone  It was like a hole in reality had opened up and swallowed him. But then the really shocking question occurred to me  If he could die  could it happen to me too  Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me  Would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as I slept  Well  at some point  all children become aware of death. It can happen in different ways  of course  and usually comes in stages. Our idea of death develops as we grow older. And if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory  you might remember something like what I felt when my grandfather died and when I realized it could happen to me too  that sense that behind all of this the void is waiting. And this development in childhood reflects the development of our species. Just as there was a point in your development as a child when your sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for you to realize you were mortal  so at some point in the evolution of our species  some early human's sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for them to become the first human to realize   I'm going to die.  This is  if you like  our curse. It's the price we pay for being so damn clever. We have to live in the knowledge that the worst thing that can possibly happen one day surely will  the end of all our projects  our hopes  our dreams  of our individual world. We each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse. And that's frightening. It's terrifying. And so we look for a way out. And in my case  as I was about five years old  this meant asking my mum. Now when I first started asking what happens when we die  the grown ups around me at the time answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness and half hearted Christianity  and the phrase I heard most often was that granddad was now  up there looking down on us   and if I should die too  which wouldn't happen of course  then I too would go up there  which made death sound a lot like an existential elevator. Now this didn't sound very plausible. I used to watch a children's news program at the time  and this was the era of space exploration. There were always rockets going up into the sky  up into space  going up there. But none of the astronauts when they came back ever mentioned having met my granddad or any other dead people. But I was scared  and the idea of taking the existential elevator to see my granddad sounded a lot better than being swallowed by the void while I slept. And so I believed it anyway  even though it didn't make much sense. And this thought process that I went through as a child  and have been through many times since  including as a grown up  is a product of what psychologists call a bias. Now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong  ways in which we miscalculate  misjudge  distort reality  or see what we want to see  and the bias I'm talking about works like this  Confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn't true and they can  instead  live forever  even if it means taking the existential elevator. Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all. It has been demonstrated in over     empirical studies. Now these studies are ingenious  but they're simple. They work like this. You take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects  and you remind one group that they're going to die but not the other  then you compare their behavior. So you're observing how it biases behavior when people become aware of their mortality. And every time  you get the same result  People who are made aware of their mortality are more willing to believe stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever. So here's an example  One recent study took two groups of agnostics  that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs. Now  one group was asked to think about being dead. The other group was asked to think about being lonely. They were then asked again about their religious beliefs. Those who had been asked to think about being dead were afterwards twice as likely to express faith in God and Jesus. Twice as likely. Even though the before they were all equally agnostic. But put the fear of death in them  and they run to Jesus. Now  this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe  regardless of the evidence  and it works not just for religion  but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form  whether it's becoming famous or having children or even nationalism  which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole. This is a bias that has shaped the course of human history. Now  the theory behind this bias in the over     studies is called terror management theory  and the idea is simple. It's just this. We develop our worldviews  that is  the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it  in order to help us manage the terror of death. And these immortality stories have thousands of different manifestations  but I believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take. And we can see them repeating themselves throughout history  just with slight variations to reflect the vocabulary of the day. Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four basic forms of immortality story  and I want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they're retold by each culture or generation using the vocabulary of their day. Now  the first story is the simplest. We want to avoid death  and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story  and it might at first sound implausible  but actually  almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever. Ancient Egypt had such myths  ancient Babylon  ancient India. Throughout European history  we find them in the work of the alchemists  and of course we still believe this today  only we tell this story using the vocabulary of science. So     years ago  hormones had just been discovered  and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease  and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells  genetic engineering  and nanotechnology. But the idea that science can cure death is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir  a story that is as old as civilization. But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy. When we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past  the one thing they now have in common is that they're all dead. So we need a backup plan  and exactly this kind of plan B is what the second kind of immortality story offers  and that's resurrection. And it stays with the idea that I am this body  I am this physical organism. It accepts that I'm going to have to die but says  despite that  I can rise up and I can live again. In other words  I can do what Jesus did. Jesus died  he was three days in the  tomb   and then he rose up and lived again. And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe  not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims. But our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age  for example  with the idea of cryonics. That's the idea that when you die  you can have yourself frozen  and then  at some point when technology has advanced enough  you can be thawed out and repaired and revived and so resurrected. And so some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again  and other people believe an  omnipotent scientist will do it. But for others  the whole idea of resurrection  of climbing out of the grave  it's just too much like a bad zombie movie. They find the body too messy  too unreliable to guarantee eternal life  and so they set their hopes on the third  more spiritual immortality story  the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul. Now  the majority of people on Earth believe they have a soul  and the idea is central to many religions. But even though  in its current form  in its traditional form  the idea of the soul is still hugely popular  nonetheless we are again reinventing it for the digital age  for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading your mind  your essence  the real you  onto a computer  and so live on as an avatar in the ether. But of course there are skeptics who say if we look at the evidence of science  particularly neuroscience  it suggests that your mind  your essence  the real you  is very much dependent on a particular part of your body  that is  your brain. And such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story  and that is legacy  the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world  like the great Greek warrior Achilles  who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy so that he might win immortal fame. And the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was  and in our digital age  it's even easier to achieve. You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles or a great king or hero. All you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat.  Laughter  But some people prefer to leave a more tangible  biological legacy    children  for example. Or they like  they hope  to live on as part of some greater whole  a nation or a family or a tribe  their gene pool. But again  there are skeptics who doubt whether legacy really is immortality. Woody Allen  for example  who said   I don't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen. I want to live on in my apartment.  So those are the four basic kinds of immortality stories  and I've tried to give just some sense of how they're retold by each generation with just slight variations to fit the fashions of the day. And the fact that they recur in this way  in such a similar form but in such different belief systems  suggests  I think  that we should be skeptical of the truth of any particular version of these stories. The fact that some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it suggests that neither are really believing this on the strength of the evidence. Rather  we believe these stories because we are biased to believe them  and we are biased to believe them because we are so afraid of death. So the question is  are we doomed to lead the one life we have in a way that is shaped by fear and denial  or can we overcome this bias  Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could. He argued that the fear of death is natural  but it is not rational.  Death   he said   is nothing to us  because when we are here  death is not  and when death is here  we are gone.  Now this is often quoted  but it's difficult to really grasp  to really internalize  because exactly this idea of being gone is so difficult to imagine. So       years later  another philosopher  Ludwig Wittgenstein  put it like this   Death is not an event in life  We do not live to experience death. And so   he added   in this sense  life has no end.  So it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void  but it wasn't rational  because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience. Now  overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us  yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational  and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us  then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives. Now  I find it helps to see life as being like a book  Just as a book is bounded by its covers  by beginning and end  so our lives are bounded by birth and death  and even though a book is limited by beginning and end  it can encompass distant landscapes  exotic figures  fantastic adventures. And even though a book is limited by beginning and end  the characters within it know no horizons. They only know the moments that make up their story  even when the book is closed. And so the characters of a book are not afraid of reaching the last page. Long John Silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of  Treasure Island.  And so it should be with us. Imagine the book of your life  its covers  its beginning and end  and your birth and your death. You can only know the moments in between  the moments that make up your life. It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers  whether before your birth or after your death. And you needn't worry how long the book is  or whether it's a comic strip or an epic. The only thing that matters is that you make it a good story. Thank you. A couple of years ago  Harvard Business School chose the best business model of that year. It chose Somali piracy. Pretty much around the same time  I discovered that there were     seafarers being held hostage on ships  often anchored just off the Somali coast in plain sight. And I learned these two facts  and I thought  what's going on in shipping  And I thought  would that happen in any other industry  Would we see     airline pilots held captive in their jumbo jets on a runway for months  or a year  Would we see     Greyhound bus drivers  It wouldn't happen. So I started to get intrigued. And I discovered another fact  which to me was more astonishing almost for the fact that I hadn't known it before at the age of       . That is how fundamentally  we still depend on shipping. Because perhaps the general public thinks of shipping as an old fashioned industry  something brought by sailboat with Moby Dicks and Jack Sparrows. But shipping isn't that. Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been. Shipping brings us    percent of world trade. Shipping has quadrupled in size since     . We are more dependent on it now than ever. And yet  for such an enormous industry    there are a         working vessels on the sea   it's become pretty much invisible. Now that sounds absurd in Singapore to say that  because here shipping is so present that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel. But elsewhere in the world  if you ask the general public what they know about shipping and how much trade is carried by sea  you will get essentially a blank face. You will ask someone on the street if they've heard of Microsoft. I should think they'll say yes  because they'll know that they make software that goes on computers  and occasionally works. But if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk  I doubt you'd get the same response  even though Maersk  which is just one shipping company amongst many  has revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft.     .  billion  Now why is this  A few years ago  the first sea lord of the British admiralty    he is called the first sea lord  although the chief of the army is not called a land lord   he said that we  and he meant in the industrialized nations in the West  that we suffer from sea blindness. We are blind to the sea as a place of industry or of work. It's just something we fly over  a patch of blue on an airline map. Nothing to see  move along. So I wanted to open my own eyes to my own sea blindness  so I ran away to sea. A couple of years ago  I took a passage on the Maersk Kendal  a mid sized container ship carrying nearly       boxes  and I departed from Felixstowe  on the south coast of England  and I ended up right here in Singapore five weeks later  considerably less jet lagged than I am right now. And it was a revelation. We traveled through five seas  two oceans  nine ports  and I learned a lot about shipping. And one of the first things that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was  where are all the people  I have friends in the Navy who tell me they sail with       sailors at a time  but on Kendal there were only    crew. Now that's because shipping is very efficient. Containerization has made it very efficient. Ships have automation now. They can operate with small crews. But it also means that  in the words of a port chaplain I once met  the average seafarer you're going to find on a container ship is either tired or exhausted  because the pace of modern shipping is quite punishing for what the shipping calls its human element  a strange phrase which they don't seem to realize sounds a little bit inhuman. So most seafarers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time. They don't have time to relax. They're at sea for months at a time  and even when they're on board  they don't have access to what a five year old would take for granted  the Internet. And another thing that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was who I was sitting next to    Not the queen  I can't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait    But around that dining table in the officer's saloon  I was sitting next to a Burmese guy  I was opposite a Romanian  a Moldavian  an Indian. On the next table was a Chinese guy  and in the crew room  it was entirely Filipinos. So that was a normal working ship. Now how is that possible  Because the biggest dramatic change in shipping over the last    years  when most of the general public stopped noticing it  was something called an open registry  or a flag of convenience. Ships can now fly the flag of any nation that provides a flag registry. You can get a flag from the landlocked nation of Bolivia  or Mongolia  or North Korea  though that's not very popular. So we have these very multinational  global  mobile crews on ships. And that was a surprise to me. And when we got to pirate waters  down the Bab el Mandeb strait and into the Indian Ocean  the ship changed. And that was also shocking  because suddenly  I realized  as the captain said to me  that I had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship. We were no longer allowed on deck. There were double pirate watches. And at that time  there were those      seafarers being held hostage  and some of them were held hostage for years because of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience. Not all of them  but some of them were  because for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners  it can be easy to hide behind the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience. What else does our sea blindness mask  Well  if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship  and look up to the funnel  you'll see very black smoke. And that's because shipping has very tight margins  and they want cheap fuel  so they use something called bunker fuel  which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry as the dregs of the refinery  or just one step up from asphalt. And shipping is the greenest method of transport. In terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile  it emits about a thousandth of aviation and about a tenth of trucking. But it's not benign  because there's so much of it. So shipping emissions are about three to four percent  almost the same as aviation's. And if you put shipping emissions on a list of the countries' carbon emissions  it would come in about sixth  somewhere near Germany. It was calculated in      that the    largest ships pollute in terms of particles and soot and noxious gases as much as all the cars in the world. And the good news is that people are now talking about sustainable shipping. There are interesting initiatives going on. But why has it taken so long  When are we going to start talking and thinking about shipping miles as well as air miles  I also traveled to Cape Cod to look at the plight of the North Atlantic right whale  because this to me was one of the most surprising things about my time at sea  and what it made me think about. We know about man's impact on the ocean in terms of fishing and overfishing  but we don't really know much about what's happening underneath the water. And in fact  shipping has a role to play here  because shipping noise has contributed to damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures. Light doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of the water  so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins and even     species of fish communicate by sound. And a North Atlantic right whale can transmit across hundreds of miles. A humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean. But a supertanker can also be heard coming across a whole ocean  and because the noise that propellers make underwater is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use  then it can damage their acoustic habitat  and they need this for breeding  for finding feeding grounds  for finding mates. And the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to    percent. But there are no laws governing  acoustic pollution yet. And when I arrived in Singapore  and I apologize for this  but I  didn't want to get off my ship. I'd really loved being on board Kendal. I'd been well treated by the crew  I'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain  and I would happily have signed up for another five weeks  something that the captain also said I was crazy to think about. But I wasn't there for nine months at a time like the Filipino seafarers  who  when I asked them to describe their job to me  called it  dollar for homesickness.  They had good salaries  but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life in a dangerous and often difficult element. But when I get to this part  I'm in two minds  because I want to salute those seafarers who bring us    percent of everything and get very little thanks or recognition for it. I want to salute the         ships that are at sea that are doing that work  coming in and out every day  bringing us what we need. But I also want to see shipping  and us  the general public  who know so little about it  to have a bit more scrutiny  to be a bit more transparent  to have    percent transparency. Because I think we could all benefit from doing something very simple  which is learning to see the sea. Thank you. By       Detroit had become the poster child for an American city in crisis. There was a housing collapse  an auto industry collapse  and the population had plummeted by    percent between      and       and many people were beginning to write it off  as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities. By       I had also been asked by the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit to join them in leading a citywide planning process for the city to create a shared vision for its future. I come to this work as an architect and an urban planner  and I've spent my career working in other contested cities  like Chicago  my hometown  Harlem  which is my current home  Washington  D.C.  and Newark  New Jersey. All of these cities  to me  still had a number of unresolved issues related to urban justice  issues of equity  inclusion and access. Now by       as well  popular design magazines were also beginning to take a closer look at cities like Detroit  and devoting whole issues to  fixing the city.  I was asked by a good friend  Fred Bernstein  to do an interview for the October issue of Architect magazine  and he and I kind of had a good chuckle when we saw the magazine released with the title   Can This Planner Save Detroit   So I'm smiling with a little bit of embarrassment right now  because obviously  it's completely absurd that a single person  let alone a planner  could save a city. But I'm also smiling because I thought it represented a sense of hopefulness that our profession could play a role in helping the city to think about how it would recover from its severe crisis. So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon and tell you a little bit about our process for fixing the city  a little bit about Detroit  and I want to do that through the voices of Detroiters. So we began our process in September of     . It's just after a special mayoral election  and word has gotten out that there is going to be this citywide planning process  which brings a lot of anxiety and fears among Detroiters. We had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this to introduce the planning process  and people came out from all over the city  including areas that were stable neighborhoods  as well as areas that were beginning to see a lot of vacancy. And most of our audience was representative of the    percent African American population in the city at that time. So obviously  we have a Q A portion of our program  and people line up to mics to ask questions. Many of them step very firmly to the mic  put their hands across their chest  and go   I know you people are trying to move me out of my house  right   So that question is really powerful  and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment  when you connect it to the stories that some Detroiters had  and actually a lot of African Americans' families have had that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit. Many of them told us the stories about how they came to own their home through their grandparents or great grandparents  who were one of  .  million people who migrated from the rural South to the industrial North  as depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence   The Great Migration.  They came to Detroit for a better way of life. Many found work in the automobile industry  the Ford Motor Company  as depicted in this mural by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art. The fruits of their labors would afford them a home  for many the first piece of property that they would ever know  and a community with other first time African American home buyers. The first couple of decades of their life in the North is quite well  up until about       which coincides with the city's peak population at  .  million people. Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see a second kind of migration  a migration to the suburbs. Between      and       the region grows by    percent. But this time  the migration leaves African Americans in place  as families and businesses flee the city  leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs. During that same period  between      and             the city loses    percent of its population  and today it hovers at above        . The audience members who come and talk to us that night tell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city with such depleted population. Many tell us that they're one of only a few homes on their block that are occupied  and that they can see several abandoned homes from where they sit on their porches. Citywide  there are        vacant homes. They can also see vacant property. They're beginning to see illegal activities on these properties  like illegal dumping  and they know that because the city has lost so much population  their costs for water  electricity  gas are rising  because there are not enough people to pay property taxes to help support the services that they need. Citywide  there are about         vacant parcels. Now  to quickly give you all a sense of a scale  because I know that sounds like a big number  but I don't think you quite understand until you look at the city map. So the city is     square miles. You can fit Boston  San Francisco  and the island of Manhattan within its footprint. So if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property and we smush it together  it looks like about    square miles  and that's roughly equivalent to the size of the island we're sitting on today  Manhattan  at    square miles. So it's a lot of vacancy. Now some of our audience members also tell us about some of the positive things that are happening in their communities  and many of them are banding together to take control of some of the vacant lots  and they're starting community gardens  which are creating a great sense of community stewardship  but they're very  very clear to tell us that this is not enough  that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them. Now there's been a lot of speculation since      about what to do with the vacant property  and a lot of that speculation has been around community gardening  or what we call urban agriculture. So many people would say to us   What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland  It can provide fresh foods  and it can put Detroiters back to work too.  When I hear that story  I always imagine the folks from the Great Migration rolling over in their graves  because you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice moving from the South to the North to create a better life for their families  only to see their great grandchildren return to an agrarian lifestyle  especially in a city where they came with little less than a high school education or even a grammar school education and were able to afford the basic elements of the American dream  steady work and a home that they owned. Now  there's a third wave of migration happening in Detroit  a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs. These folks see that same vacant land and those same abandoned homes as opportunity for new  entrepreneurial ideas and profit  so much so that former models can move to Detroit  buy property  start successful businesses and restaurants  and become successful community activists in their neighborhood  bringing about very positive change. Similarly  we have small manufacturing companies making conscious decisions to relocate to the city. This company  Shinola  which is a luxury watch and bicycle company  deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit  and they quote themselves by saying they were drawn to the global brand  of Detroit's innovation. And they also knew that  they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things. Now we have community stewardship happening in neighborhoods  we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions to move to the city and create enterprises  and we have businesses relocating  and this is all in the context of what is no secret to us all  a city that's under the control of an emergency manager  and just this July filed for Chapter   bankruptcy. So       we started this process  and by       we released Detroit Future City  which was our strategic plan to guide the city into a better and more prosperous and more sustainable existence    not what it was  but what it could be  looking at new ways of economic growth  new forms of land use  more sustainable and denser neighborhoods  a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system  and a heightened capacity for civic leaders to take action and implement change. Three key imperatives were really important to our work. One was that the city itself wasn't necessarily too large  but the economy was too small. There are only    jobs per     people in Detroit  very different from a Denver or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia that are anywhere between     to    jobs per     people. Secondly  there had to be an acceptance that we were not going to be able to use all of this vacant land in the way that we had before and maybe for some time to come. It wasn't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods as we had before  and urban agriculture  while a very productive and successful intervention happening in Detroit  was not the only answer  that what we had to do is look at these areas where we had significant vacancy but still had a significant number of population of what could be new  productive  innovative  and entrepreneurial uses that could stabilize those communities  where still nearly         residents lived. So we came up with one neighborhood typology    there are several    called a live make neighborhood  where folks could reappropriate abandoned structures and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises  with a specific emphasis on looking at the  again  majority    percent African American population. So they  too  could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the communities with which they resided. Then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses  so that it could be used for storm water management  for example  by using surface lakes and retention ponds  that created neighborhood amenities  places of recreation  and actually helped to elevate adjacent property levels. Or we could use it as research plots  where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils  or we could use it to generate energy. So the descendants of the Great Migration could either become precision watchmakers at Shinola  like Willie H.  who was featured in one of their ads last year  or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like Shinola. The good news is  there is a future for the next generation of Detroiters  both those there now and those that want to come. So no thank you  Mayor Menino  who recently was quoted as saying   I'd blow up the place and start over.  There are very important people  business and land assets in Detroit  and there are real opportunities there. So while Detroit might not be what it was  Detroit will not die. Thank you. Einstein said that  I never think about the future   it comes soon enough.  And he was right  of course. So today  I'm here to ask you to think of how the future is happening now. Over the past     years  the world has experienced two major waves of innovation. First  the Industrial Revolution brought us machines and factories  railways  electricity  air travel  and our lives have never been the same. Then the Internet revolution brought us computing power  data networks  unprecedented access to information and communication  and our lives have never been the same. Now we are experiencing another metamorphic change  the industrial Internet. It brings together intelligent machines  advanced analytics  and the creativity of people at work. It's the marriage of minds and machines. And our lives will never be the same. In my current role  I see up close how technology is beginning to transform industrial sectors that play a huge role in our economy and in our lives  energy  aviation  transportation  health care. For an economist  this is highly unusual  and it's extremely exciting  because this is a transformation as powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more  and before the Industrial Revolution  there was no economic growth to speak of. So what is this industrial Internet  Industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see  hear  feel a lot more than ever before  generating prodigious amounts of data. Increasingly sophisticated analytics then sift through the data  providing insights that allow us to operate the machines in entirely new ways  a lot more efficiently. And not just individual machines  but fleets of locomotives  airplanes  entire systems like power grids  hospitals. It is asset optimization and system optimization. Of course  electronic sensors have been around for some time  but something has changed  a sharp decline in the cost of sensors and  thanks to advances in cloud computing  a rapid decrease in the cost of storing and processing data. So we are moving to a world where the machines we work with are not just intelligent  they are brilliant. They are self aware  they are predictive  reactive and social. It's jet engines  locomotives  gas turbines  medical devices  communicating seamlessly with each other and with us. It's a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it. We are beginning to deploy throughout the industrial system embedded virtualization  multi core processor technology  advanced cloud based communications  a new software defined machine infrastructure which allows machine functionality to become virtualized in software  decoupling machine software from hardware  and allowing us to remotely and automatically monitor  manage and upgrade industrial assets. Why does any of this matter at all  Well first of all  it's already allowing us to shift towards preventive  condition based maintenance  which means fixing machines just before they break  without wasting time servicing them on a fixed schedule. And this  in turn  is pushing us towards zero unplanned downtime  which means there will be no more power outages  no more flight delays. So let me give you a few examples of how these brilliant machines work  and some of the examples may seem trivial  some are clearly more profound  but all of them are going to have a very powerful impact. Let's start with aviation. Today     percent of all flights cancellations and delays are due to unscheduled maintenance events. Something goes wrong unexpectedly. This results in eight billion dollars in costs for the airline industry globally every year  not to mention the impact on all of us  stress  inconvenience  missed meetings as we sit helplessly in an airport terminal. So how can the industrial Internet help here  We've developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft. It's self learning and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss. The aircraft  while in flight  will communicate with technicians on the ground. By the time it lands  they will already know if anything needs to be serviced. Just in the U.S.  a system like this can prevent over        delays and cancellations every year  helping seven million passengers get to their destinations on time. Or take healthcare. Today  nurses spend an average of    minutes per shift looking for medical equipment. That seems trivial  but it's less time spent caring for patients. St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston  Texas  which has deployed industrial Internet technology to electronically monitor and connect patients  staff and medical equipment  has reduced bed turnaround times by nearly one hour. If you need surgery  one hour matters. It means more patients can be treated  more lives can be saved. Another medical center  in Washington state  is piloting an application that allows medical images from city scanners and MRIs to be analyzed in the cloud  developing better analytics at a lower cost. Imagine a patient who has suffered a severe trauma  and needs the attention of several specialists  a neurologist  a cardiologist  an orthopedic surgeon. If all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access to scans and images as they are taken  they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster. So all of this translates into better health outcomes  but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits. Just a one percent reduction in existing inefficiencies could yield savings of over    billion dollars to the healthcare industry worldwide  and that is just a drop in the sea compared to what we need to do to make healthcare affordable on a sustainable basis. Similar advances are happening in energy  including renewable energy. Wind farms equipped with new remote monitorings and diagnostics that allow wind turbines to talk to each other and adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way  depending on how the wind is blowing  can now produce electricity at a cost of less than five cents per kilowatt hour. Ten years ago  that cost was    cents  six times as much. The list goes on  and it will grow fast  because industrial data are now growing exponentially. By       they will account for over    percent of all digital information. But this is not just about data  so let me switch gears and tell you how this is impacting already the jobs we do every day  because this new wave of innovation is bringing about new tools and applications that will allow us to collaborate in a smarter and faster way  making our jobs not just more efficient but more rewarding. Imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm with a handheld device telling her which turbines need servicing. She already has all the spare parts  because the problems were diagnosed in advanced. And if she faces an unexpected issue  the same handheld device will allow her to communicate with colleagues at the service center  let them see what she sees  transmit data that they can run through diagnostics  and they can stream videos that will guide her  step by step  through whatever complex procedure is needed to get the machines back up and running. And their interaction gets documented and stored in a searchable database. Let's stop and think about this for a minute  because this is a very important point. This new wave of innovation is fundamentally changing the way we work. And I know that many of you will be concerned  about the impact that innovation might have on jobs. Unemployment is already high  and there is always a fear  that innovation will destroy jobs. And innovation is disruptive. But let me stress two things here. First  we've already lived through mechanization of agriculture  automation of industry  and employment has gone up  because innovation is fundamentally about growth. It makes products more affordable. It creates new demand  new jobs. Second  there is a concern that in the future  there will only be room for engineers  data scientists  and other highly specialized workers. And believe me  as an economist  I am also scared. But think about it  Just as a child can easily figure out how to operate an iPad  so a new generation of mobile and intuitive industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels. The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man than the Charlie Chaplin of  Modern Times.  And to be sure  new high skilled jobs will be created  mechanical digital engineers who understand both the machines and the data  managers who understand their industry and the analytics and can reorganize the business to take full advantage of the technology. But now let's take a step back. Let's look at the big picture. There are people who argue that today's innovation is all about social media and silly games  with nowhere near the transformational power of the Industrial Revolution. They say that all the growth enhancing innovations are behind us. And every time I hear this  I can't help thinking that even back in the Stone Age  there must have been a group of cavemen sitting around a fire one day looking very grumpy  and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill  and saying to each other   Yeah  this wheel thing  cool toy  sure  but compared to fire  it will have no impact. The big discoveries are all behind us.  This technological revolution is as inspiring and transformational as anything we have ever seen. Human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward. They've created jobs. They've raised living standards. They've made our lives healthier and more rewarding. And the new wave of innovation which is beginning to sweep through industry is no different. In the U.S. alone  the industrial Internet could raise average income by    to    percent over the next    years  boosting growth to rates we haven't seen in a long time  and adding between    and    trillion dollars to global GDP. That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today. But this is not a foregone conclusion. We are just at the beginning of this transformation  and there will be barriers to break  obstacles to overcome. We will need to invest in the new technologies. We will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices. We will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. And the education system will need to evolve to ensure students are equipped with the right skills. It's not going to be easy  but it is going to be worth it. The economic challenges facing us are hard  but when I walk the factory floor  and I see how humans and brilliant machines are becoming interconnected  and I see the difference this makes in a hospital  in an airport  in a power generation plant  I'm not just optimistic  I'm enthusiastic. This new technological revolution is upon us. So think about the future   it will be here soon enough. Thank you.  I felt a Funeral  in my Brain  and Mourners to and fro kept treading    treading    till  it seemed  that Sense was breaking through    And when they all were seated  a Service  like a Drum    kept beating    beating    till I  thought  my Mind was going numb    And then I heard them lift a Box and creak across my Soul with those same Boots of Lead  again  then Space    began to toll  As  all  the Heavens were a Bell  and Being   but  an Ear  and I  and Silence  some strange Race  wrecked  solitary  here     And  then a Plank in Reason  broke  and I fell down and down    and hit a World  at every plunge  and Finished knowing    then     We know depression through metaphors. Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language  Goya in an image. Half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states. As for me  I had always thought myself tough  one of the people who could survive if I'd been sent to a concentration camp. In       I had a series of losses. My mother died  a relationship I'd been in ended  I moved back to the United States from some years abroad  and I got through all of those experiences intact. But in       three years later  I found myself losing interest in almost everything. I didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do  and I didn't know why. The opposite of depression is not happiness  but vitality. And it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment. Everything there was to do seemed like too much work. I would come home and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine  and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends  I would think   What a lot of people that is to have to call back.  Or I would decide I should have lunch  and then I would think  but I'd have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it and swallow it  and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross. And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it's ridiculous. You know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it. You know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door and that it's not a big deal  and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it. And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less. It was a kind of nullity. And then the anxiety set in. If you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month  I would say   As long I know it'll be over in November  I can do it.  But if you said to me   You have to have acute anxiety for the next month   I would rather slit my wrist than go through it. It was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if you're walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you  but instead of lasting half a second  the way that does  it lasted for six months. It's a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of. And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive  and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people. And finally one day  I woke up and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke  because I lay in bed completely frozen  looking at the telephone  thinking   Something is wrong and I should call for help   and I couldn't reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial. And finally  after four full hours of my lying and staring at it  the phone rang  and somehow I managed to pick it up  and it was my father  and I said   I'm in serious trouble. We need to do something.  The next day I started with the medications and the therapy. And I also started reckoning with this terrible question  If I'm not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp  then who am I  And if I have to take medication  is that medication making me more fully myself  or is it making me someone else  And how do I feel about it if it's making me someone else  I had two advantages as I went into the fight. The first is that I knew that  objectively speaking  I had a nice life  and that if I could only get well  there was something at the other end that was worth living for. And the other was that I had access to good treatment. But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed  and emerged and relapsed  and emerged and relapsed  and finally understood I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever. And I thought   But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem  And does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure   And I couldn't figure out which it was. And then I understood that actually  we aren't advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully. The chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play  and I also figured out that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality. I want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling. They're not very effective. They're extremely costly. They come with innumerable side effects. They're a disaster. But I am so grateful that I live now and not    years ago  when there would have been almost nothing to be done. I hope that    years hence  people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science. Depression is the flaw in love. If you were married to someone and thought   Well  if my wife dies  I'll find another one   it wouldn't be love as we know it. There's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss  and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy. There are three things people tend to confuse  depression  grief and sadness. Grief is explicitly reactive. If you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy  and then  six months later  you are still deeply sad  but you're functioning a little better  it's probably grief  and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure. If you experience a catastrophic loss  and you feel terrible  and six months later you can barely function at all  then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances. The trajectory tells us a great deal. People think of depression as being just sadness. It's much  much too much sadness  much too much grief at far too slight a cause. As I set out to understand depression  and to interview people who had experienced it  I found that there were people who seemed  on the surface  to have what sounded like relatively mild depression who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it. And there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes. And I set out to find out what it is that causes some people to be more resilient than other people. What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive  And I went out and I interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression. One of the first people I interviewed described depression as a slower way of being dead  and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness  that this is a serious business. It's the leading disability worldwide  and people die of it every day. One of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this was a beloved friend who I had known for many years  and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college  and then plummeted into a horrific depression. She had bipolar illness  or manic depression  as it was then known. And then she did very well for many years on lithium  and then eventually  she was taken off her lithium to see how she would do without it  and she had another psychosis  and then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen in which she sat in her parents' apartment  more or less catatonic  essentially without moving  day after day after day. And when I interviewed her about that experience some years later    she's a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins    when I interviewed her  she said   I was singing 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone ' over and over  to occupy my mind. I was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying  which were  'You are nothing. You are nobody. You don't even deserve to live.' And that was when I really started thinking about killing myself.  You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away  the veil of happiness  and that now you're seeing truly. It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised  but it's difficult with depressives  because we believe we are seeing the truth. But the truth lies. I became obsessed with that sentence   But the truth lies.  And I discovered  as I talked to depressive people  that they have many delusional perceptions. People will say   No one loves me.  And you say   I love you  your wife loves you  your mother loves you.  You can answer that one pretty readily  at least for most people. But people who are depressed will also say   No matter what we do  we're all just going to die in the end.  Or they'll say   There can be no true communion between two human beings. Each of us is trapped in his own body.  To which you have to say   That's true  but I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast.  A lot of the time  what they are expressing is not illness  but insight  and one comes to think what's really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don't distract us very much. There was a study I particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of non depressed people were asked to play a video game for an hour  and at the end of the hour  they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed. The depressive group was usually accurate to within about    percent  and the non depressed people guessed between    and    times as many little monsters    as they had actually killed. A lot of people said  when I chose to write about my depression  that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet  to have people know. They said   Do people talk to you differently   I said   Yes  people talk to me differently. They talk to me differently insofar as they start telling me about their experience  or their sister's experience  or their friend's experience. Things are different because now I know that depression is the family secret that everyone has. I went a few years ago to a conference  and on Friday of the three day conference  one of the participants took me aside  and she said   I suffer from depression and I'm a little embarrassed about it  but I've been taking this medication  and I just wanted to ask you what you think   And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could. And then she said   You know  my husband would never understand this. He's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense  so  you know  it's just between us.  And I said   Yes  that's fine.  On Sunday of the same conference  her husband took me aside  and he said   My wife wouldn't think that I was really much of a guy if she knew this  but I've been dealing with this depression and I'm taking some medication  and I wondered what you think   They were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom. And I said that I thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems. But I was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy. Depression is so exhausting. It takes up so much of your time and energy  and silence about it  it really does make the depression worse. And then I began thinking about all the ways people make themselves better. I'd started off as a medical conservative. I thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked  it was clear what they were    there was medication  there were certain psychotherapies  there was possibly electroconvulsive treatment  and that everything else was nonsense. But then I discovered something. If you have brain cancer  and you say that standing on your head for    minutes every morning makes you feel better  it may make you feel better  but you still have brain cancer  and you'll still probably die from it. But if you say that you have depression  and standing on your head for    minutes every day makes you feel better  then it's worked  because depression is an illness of how you feel  and if you feel better  then you are effectively not depressed anymore. So I became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments. And I get letters  I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what's worked for them. Someone was asking me backstage today about meditation. My favorite of the letters that I got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy  medication  she had tried pretty much everything  and she had found a solution and hoped I would tell the world  and that was making little things from yarn. She sent me some of them. And I'm not wearing them right now. I suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM. And yet  when I went to look at alternative treatments  I also gained perspective on other treatments. I went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal that involved a great deal of ram's blood and that I'm not going to detail right now  but a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda  working on a different project  and I happened to describe my experience to someone  and he said   Well  that's West Africa  and we're in East Africa  and our rituals are in some ways very different  but we do have some rituals that have something in common with what you're describing.  And he said   But we've had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers  especially the ones who came right after the genocide.  I said   What kind of trouble did you have   And he said   Well  they would do this bizarre thing. They didn't take people out in the sunshine where you begin to feel better. They didn't include drumming or music to get people's blood going. They didn't involve the whole community. They didn't externalize the depression as an invasive spirit. Instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them.  He said   We had to ask them to leave the country.  Now at the other end of alternative treatments  let me tell you about Frank Russakoff. Frank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that I've ever seen in a man. He was constantly depressed. He was  when I met him  at a point at which every month  he would have electroshock treatment. Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week. Then he would feel okay for a week. Then he would have a week of going downhill. And then he would have another electroshock treatment. And he said to me when I met him   It's unbearable to go through my weeks this way. I can't go on this way  and I've figured out how I'm going to end it if I don't get better.   But   he said to me   I heard about a protocol at Mass General for a procedure called a cingulotomy  which is a brain surgery  and I think I'm going to give that a try.  And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so many different treatments still had buried in him  somewhere  enough optimism to reach out for one more. And he had the cingulotomy  and it was incredibly successful. He's now a friend of mine. He has a lovely wife and two beautiful children. He wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery  and he said   My father sent me two presents this year  First  a motorized CD rack from The Sharper Image that I didn't really need  but I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate the fact that I'm living on my own and have a job I seem to love. And the other present was a photo of my grandmother  who committed suicide. As I unwrapped it  I began to cry  and my mother came over and said  'Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew ' And I said  'She had the same disease I have.' I'm crying now as I write to you. It's not that I'm so sad  but I get overwhelmed  I think  because I could have killed myself  but my parents kept me going  and so did the doctors  and I had the surgery. I'm alive and grateful. We live in the right time  even if it doesn't always feel like it.  I was struck by the fact that depression is broadly perceived to be a modern  Western  middle class thing  and I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts  and one of the things I was most interested in was depression among the indigent. And so I went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression. And what I discovered is that poor people are mostly not being treated for depression. Depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability  which is presumably evenly distributed in the population  and triggering circumstances  which are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished. And yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time  you think   Why do I feel like this  I must have depression.  And you set out to find treatment for it. But if you have a perfectly awful life  and you feel miserable all the time  the way you feel is commensurate with your life  and it doesn't occur to you to think   Maybe this is treatable.  And so we have an epidemic in this country of depression among impoverished people that's not being picked up and that's not being treated and that's not being addressed  and it's a tragedy of a grand order. And so I found an academic who was doing a research project in slums outside of D.C.  where she picked up women who had come in for other health problems and diagnosed them with depression  and then provided six months of the experimental protocol. One of them  Lolly  came in  and this is what she said the day she came in. She said  and she was a woman  by the way  who had seven children. She said   I used to have a job but I had to give it up because I couldn't go out of the house. I have nothing to say to my children. In the morning  I can't wait for them to leave  and then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head  and three o'clock when they come home  it just comes so fast.  She said   I've been taking a lot of Tylenol  anything I can take so that I can sleep more. My husband has been telling me I'm stupid  I'm ugly. I wish I could stop the pain.  Well  she was brought into this experimental protocol  and when I interviewed her six months later  she had taken a job working in childcare for the U.S. Navy  she had left the abusive husband  and she said to me   My kids are so much happier now.  She said   There's one room in my new place for the boys and one room for the girls  but at night  they're just all up on my bed  and we're doing homework all together and everything. One of them wants to be a preacher  one of them wants to be a firefighter  and one of the girls says she's going to be a lawyer. They don't cry like they used to  and they don't fight like they did. That's all I need now  is my kids. Things keep on changing  the way I dress  the way I feel  the way I act. I can go outside not being afraid anymore  and I don't think those bad feelings are coming back  and if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that  I would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head  if I were still alive at all. I asked the Lord to send me an angel  and He heard my prayers.  I was really moved by these experiences  and I decided that I wanted to write about them not only in a book I was working on  but also in an article  and I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine to write about depression among the indigent. And I turned in my story  and my editor called me and said   We really can't publish this.  And I said   Why not   And she said   It just is too far fetched. These people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and they're virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley  It's just too implausible.  She said   I've never even heard of anything like it.  And I said   The fact that you've never heard of it is an indication that it is news.   And you are a news magazine.  So after a certain amount of negotiation  they agreed to it. But I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this distaste that people still have for the idea of treatment  the notion that somehow if we went out and treated a lot of people in indigent communities  that would be exploitative  because we would be changing them. There is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us  that treatment of depression  the medications and so on  are an artifice  and that it's not natural. And I think that's very misguided. It would be natural for people's teeth to fall out  but there is nobody militating against toothpaste  at least not in my circles. People then say   But isn't depression part of what people are supposed to experience  Didn't we evolve to have depression  Isn't it part of your personality   To which I would say  mood is adaptive. Being able to have sadness and fear and joy and pleasure and all of the other moods that we have  that's incredibly valuable. And major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken. It's maladaptive. People will come to me and say   I think  though  if I just stick it out for another year  I think I can just get through this.  And I always say to them   You may get through it  but you'll never be    again. Life is short  and that's a whole year you're talking about giving up. Think it through.  It's a strange poverty of the English language  and indeed of many other languages  that we use this same word  depression  to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday  and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide. People say to me   Well  is it continuous with normal sadness   And I say  in a way it's continuous with normal sadness. There is a certain amount of continuity  but it's the same way there's continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot that you have to sand off and do a little repainting  and what happens if you leave the house for     years and it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust. And it's that orange dust spot  that orange dust problem  that's the one we're setting out to address. So now people say   You take these happy pills  and do you feel happy   And I don't. But I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch  and I don't feel sad about my answering machine  and I don't feel sad about taking a shower. I feel more  in fact  I think  because I can feel sadness without nullity. I feel sad about professional disappointments  about damaged relationships  about global warming. Those are the things that I feel sad about now. And I said to myself  well  what is the conclusion  How did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through  What is the mechanism of resilience  And what I came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience  and say   I was depressed a long time ago  I never want to think about it again  I'm not going to look at it and I'm just going to get on with my life   ironically  those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have. Shutting out the depression strengthens it. While you hide from it  it grows. And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition. Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience. So Frank Russakoff said to me   If I had a do over  I suppose I wouldn't do it this way  but in a strange way  I'm grateful for what I've experienced. I'm glad to have been in the hospital    times. It taught me so much about love  and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me  and will be always.  And Maggie Robbins said   I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic  and I would just talk and talk and talk  and the people I was dealing with weren't very responsive  and I thought  'That's not very friendly or helpful of them.'   And then I realized  I realized that they weren't going to do more than make those first few minutes of small talk. It was simply going to be an occasion where I didn't have AIDS and I wasn't dying  but could tolerate the fact that they did and they were. Our needs are our greatest assets. It turns out I've learned to give all the things I need.  Valuing one's depression does not prevent a relapse  but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself easier to tolerate. The question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful. It's of seeking that meaning and thinking  when it comes again   This will be hellish  but I will learn something from it.  I have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be  how it can be more real than facts  and I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way. The opposite of depression is not happiness  but vitality  and these days  my life is vital  even on the days when I'm sad. I felt that funeral in my brain  and I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world  and I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul that I had never formulated until that day    years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit. I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again  I've found a way to love my depression. I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy. I love it because each day I decide  sometimes gamely  and sometimes against the moment's reason  to cleave to the reasons for living. And that  I think  is a highly privileged rapture. Thank you. Thank you. Nine years ago  I worked for the U.S. government in Iraq  helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure. And I was there  and I worked in that job because I believe that technology can improve people's lives. One afternoon  I had tea with a storekeeper at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad  and he said to me   You Americans  you can put a man on the moon  but when I get home tonight  I won't be able to turn on my lights.  At the time  the U.S. government had spent more than two billion dollars on electricity reconstruction. How do you ensure technology reaches users  How do you put it in their hands so that it is useful  So those are the questions that my colleagues and I at D Rev ask ourselves. And D Rev is short for Design Revolution. And I took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users  and not just any users  but customers who live on less than four dollars a day. One of the key areas we've been working on recently is medical devices  and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with Iraq's electricity grid then  there are some commonalities. Despite the advanced technology  it's not reaching the people who need it most. So I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on  the ReMotion Knee  and it's a prosthetic knee for above knee amputees. And this project started when the Jaipur Foot Organization  the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world  came to the Bay Area and they said   We need a better knee.  Chances are  if you're living on less than four dollars a day  and you're an amputee  you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident. Most people think it's land mines  but it's a vehicle accident. You're walking by the side of the road and you're hit by a truck  or you're trying to to jump on a moving train  you're late for work  and your pant leg gets caught. And the reality is that if you don't have much money  like this young named Kamal right here  the option you really have is a bamboo staff to get around. And how big a problem is this  There's over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee. And what are their options  This is a high end. This is what we'd call a  smart knee.  It's got a microprocessor inside. It can pretty much do anything  but it's        dollars  and to give you a sense of who wears this  veterans  American veterans coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq would be fit with something like this. This is a low end titanium knee. It's a polycentric knee  and all that that means is the mechanism  is a four bar mechanism  that mimics a natural human knee. But at       dollars  it's still too expensive for people like Kamal. And lastly  here you see a low end knee. This is a knee that's been designed specifically for poor people. And while you have affordability  you've lost on functionality. The mechanism here is a single axis  and a single axis is like a door hinge. So you can think about how unstable that would be. And this is the type of mechanism that the Jaipur Foot Organization was using when they were looking for a better knee  and I just wanted to give you a sense of what a leg system looks like  because I'm showing you all these knees and I imagine it's hard to think  how it all fits together. So at the top you have a socket  and this fits over someone's residual limb  and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different. And then you have the knee  and here I've got a single axis on the knee so you can see how it rotates  and then a pylon  and then a foot. And we've been able to develop a knee  a polycentric knee  so that type of knee that acts like a human knee  mimics human gait  for    dollars retail. But the key is  you can have this great invention  you can have this great design  but how do you get it to the people who most need it  How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives  So at D Rev  we've done some other projects  and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers  to users  to people who need it. And the first thing is that the product  needs to be world class. It needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market. Regardless of your income level  you want the most beautiful  the best product that there is. I'm going to show you a video now of a man named Ash. You can see him walking. He's wearing the same knee system here with a single axis knee. And he's doing a    meter walk test. And you'll notice that he's struggling  with stability as he's walking. And something that's not obvious  that you can't see  is that it's psychologically draining to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling. Now this is a video of Kamal. You remember Kamal earlier  holding the bamboo staff. He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee  and he's doing that same    meter walk test. And you can see his stability is much better. So world class isn't just about technical performance. It's also about human performance. And most medical devices  we've learned  as we've dug in  are really designed for Westerners  for wealthier economies. But the reality is our users  our customers  they do different things. They sit cross legged more. We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer. And we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market. So the second thing we learned  and this leads into my second point  which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user centric. And at D Rev  we go one step further and we say you need to be user obsessed. So it's not just the end user that you're thinking about  but everyone who interacts with the product  so  for example  the prosthetist who fits the knee  but also the context in which the knee is being fit. What is the local market like  How do all these components get to the clinic  Do they all get there on time  The supply chain. Everything that goes into ensuring that this product gets to the end user  and it goes in as part of the system  and it's used. So I wanted to show you some of the iterations we did between the first version  the Jaipur Knee  so this is it right here. Notice anything about it  It clicks. We'd seen that users had actually modified it. So do you see that black strip right there  That's a homemade noise dampener. We also saw that our users had modified it in other ways. You can see there that that particular amputee  he had wrapped bandages around the knee. He'd made a cosmesis. And if you look at the knee  it's got those pointy edges  right  So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari  it's really obvious that you're wearing a prosthetic limb  and in societies where there's social stigma around being disabled  people are particularly acute about this. So I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did. We did a lot of iterations  not just  around this  but some other things. But here we have the version three   the ReMotion Knee  but if you look in here  you can see the noise dampener. It's quieter. The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile. We made it thinner. And something that's not obvious is that we designed it for mass production. And this goes into my last point. We really  truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed  it needs to be market driven  and market driven means that products are sold. They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized. Our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user. It also has to be designed to be very affordable. But a product that is valued by a customer is used by a customer  and use is what creates impact. And we believe that as designers  it holds us accountable to our customers. And with centralized manufacturing  you can control the quality control  and you can hit that     price point with profit margins built in. And now  those profit margins are critical  because if you want to scale  if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a knee  it needs to be economically sustainable. So I want to give you a sense of where we are at. We have fit over       amputees  and one of the big indicators we're looking at  of course  is  does it improve lives  Well  the standard is  is someone still wearing their knee six months later  The industry average is about    percent. Ours is    percent  and we're hoping to get that higher. Right now  our knees are worn in    countries. This is where we want to get  though  in the next three years. We'll double the impact in       and we'll double it each of the following years after that. But then we hit a new challenge  and that's the number of skilled prosthetists who are able to fit knees. So I want to end with a story of Pournima. Pournima was    years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg  and she traveled    hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee  and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers  she's particularly meaningful to me  as an engineer and as a woman  because she was in school  she had just started school to study engineering. And she said   Well  now that I can walk again  I can go back and complete my studies.  And to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users. So thank you. I want you to  for a moment  think about playing a game of Monopoly  except in this game  that combination of skill  talent and luck that help earn you success in games  as in life  has been rendered irrelevant  because this game's been rigged  and you've got the upper hand. You've got more money  more opportunities to move around the board  and more access to resources. And as you think about that experience  I want you to ask yourself  how might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game change the way that you think about yourself and regard that other player  So we ran a study on the U.C. Berkeley campus to look at exactly that question. We brought in more than     pairs of strangers into the lab  and with the flip of a coin randomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game. They got two times as much money. When they passed Go  they collected twice the salary  and they got to roll both dice instead of one  so they got to move around the board a lot more. And over the course of    minutes  we watched through hidden cameras what happened. And what I want to do today  for the first time  is show you a little bit of what we saw. You're going to have to pardon the sound quality  in some cases  because again  these were hidden cameras. So we've provided subtitles. Rich Player  How many    s did you have  Poor Player  Just one. Rich Player  Are you serious. Poor Player  Yeah. Rich Player  I have three.  Laughs  I don't know why they gave me so much. Paul Piff  Okay  so it was quickly apparent to players that something was up. One person clearly has a lot more money than the other person  and yet  as the game unfolded  we saw very notable differences and dramatic differences begin to emerge between the two players. The rich player started to move around the board louder  literally smacking the board with their piece as he went around. We were more likely to see signs of dominance and nonverbal signs  displays of power and celebration among the rich players. We had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side. It's on the bottom right corner there. That allowed us to watch participants' consummatory behavior. So we're just tracking how many pretzels participants eat. Rich Player  Are those pretzels a trick  Poor Player  I don't know. PP  Okay  so no surprises  people are onto us. They wonder what that bowl of pretzels is doing there in the first place. One even asks  like you just saw  is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick  And yet  despite that  the power of the situation seems to inevitably dominate  and those rich players start to eat more pretzels. Rich Player  I love pretzels. PP  And as the game went on  one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns that we observed begin to emerge was that the rich players actually started to become ruder toward the other person  less and less sensitive to the plight of those poor  poor players  and more and more demonstrative of their material success  more likely to showcase how well they're doing. Rich Player  I have money for everything. Poor Player  How much is that  Rich Player  You owe me    dollars. You're going to lose all your money soon. I'll buy it. I have so much money. I have so much money  it takes me forever. Rich Player    I'm going to buy out this whole board. Rich Player    You're going to run out of money soon. I'm pretty much untouchable at this point. PP  Okay  and here's what I think was really  really interesting  is that at the end of the    minutes  we asked the players to talk about their experience during the game. And when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of Monopoly    they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game  and they became far less attuned to all those different features of the situation  including that flip of a coin that had randomly gotten them into that privileged position in the first place. And that's a really  really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of advantage. Now this game of Monopoly can be used as a metaphor for understanding society and its hierarchical structure  wherein some people have a lot of wealth and a lot of status  and a lot of people don't. They have a lot less wealth and a lot less status and a lot less access to valued resources. And what my colleagues and I for the last seven years have been doing is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies. What we've been finding across dozens of studies and thousands of participants across this country is that as a person's levels of wealth increase  their feelings of compassion and empathy go down  and their feelings of entitlement  of deservingness  and their ideology of self interest increases. In surveys  we found that it's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize greed being good  and that the pursuit of self interest is favorable and moral. Now what I want to do today is talk about some of the implications of this ideology self interest  talk about why we should care about those implications  and end with what might be done. Some of the first studies that we ran in this area looked at helping behavior  something social psychologists call pro social behavior. And we were really interested in who's more likely to offer help to another person  someone who's rich or someone who's poor. In one of the studies  we bring in rich and poor members of the community into the lab and give each of them the equivalent of    dollars. We told the participants that they could keep these    dollars for themselves  or they could share a portion of it  if they wanted to  with a stranger who is totally anonymous. They'll never meet that stranger and the stranger will never meet them. And we just monitor how much people give. Individuals who made        sometimes under        dollars a year  gave    percent more of their money to the stranger than did individuals making         or         dollars a year. We've had people play games to see who's more or less likely to cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize. In one of the games  we actually rigged a computer so that die rolls over a certain score were impossible. You couldn't get above    in this game  and yet  the richer you were  the more likely you were to cheat in this game to earn credits toward a     cash prize  sometimes by three to four times as much. We ran another study where we looked at whether people would be inclined to take candy from a jar of candy that we explicitly identified as being reserved for children    participating    I'm not kidding. I know it sounds like I'm making a joke. We explicitly told participants this jar of candy's for children participating in a developmental lab nearby. They're in studies. This is for them. And we just monitored how much candy participants took. Participants who felt rich took two times as much candy as participants who felt poor. We've even studied cars  not just any cars  but whether drivers of different kinds of cars are more or less inclined to break the law. In one of these studies  we looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian that we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk. Now in California  as you all know  because I'm sure we all do this  it's the law to stop for a pedestrian who's waiting to cross. So here's an example of how we did it. That's our confederate off to the left posing as a pedestrian. He approaches as the red truck successfully stops. In typical California fashion  it's overtaken by the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over. Now here's an example of a more expensive car  a Prius  driving through  and a BMW doing the same. So we did this for hundreds of vehicles on several days  just tracking who stops and who doesn't. What we found was that as the expensiveness of a car increased  the driver's tendencies to break the law increased as well. None of the cars  none of the cars in our least expensive car category broke the law. Close to    percent of the cars in our most expensive vehicle category broke the law. We've run other studies finding that wealthier individuals are more likely to lie in negotiations  to endorse unethical behavior at work like stealing cash from the cash register  taking bribes  lying to customers. Now I don't mean to suggest that it's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior. Not at all. In fact  I think that we all  in our day to day  minute by minute lives  struggle with these competing motivations of when  or if  to put our own interests above the interests of other people. And that's understandable because the American dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper  as long as we apply ourselves and work hard  and a piece of that means that sometimes  you need to put your own interests above the interests and well being of other people around you. But what we're finding is that  the wealthier you are  the more likely you are to pursue a vision of personal success  of achievement and accomplishment  to the detriment of others around you. Here I've plotted for you the mean household income received by each fifth and top five percent of the population over the last    years. In       the differences between the different quintiles of the population  in terms of income  are fairly egregious. It's not difficult to discern that there are differences. But over the last    years  that significant difference has become a grand canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else. In fact  the top    percent of our population own close to    percent of the total wealth in this country. We're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality. What that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select group of individuals  but the American dream is becoming increasingly unattainable for an increasing majority of us. And if it's the case  as we've been finding  that the wealthier you are  the more entitled you feel to that wealth  and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people  and be willing to do things to serve that self interest  well then there's no reason to think that those patterns will change. In fact  there's every reason to think that they'll only get worse  and that's what it would look like if things just stayed the same  at the same linear rate  over the next    years. Now  inequality  economic inequality  is something we should all be concerned about  and not just because of those at the bottom of the social hierarchy  but because individuals and groups with lots of economic inequality do worse  not just the people at the bottom  everyone. There's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top labs all over the world showcasing the range of things that are undermined as economic inequality gets worse. Social mobility  things we really care about  physical health  social trust  all go down as inequality goes up. Similarly  negative things in social collectives and societies  things like obesity  and violence  imprisonment  and punishment  are exacerbated as economic inequality increases. Again  these are outcomes not just experienced by a few  but that resound across all strata of society. Even people at the top experience these outcomes. So what do we do  This cascade of self perpetuating  pernicious  negative effects could seem like something that's spun out of control  and there's nothing we can do about it  certainly nothing we as individuals could do. But in fact  we've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions  small changes to people's values  small nudges in certain directions  can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy. For instance  reminding people of the benefits of cooperation  or the advantages of community  cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people. In one study  we had people watch a brief video  just    seconds long  about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them  and after watching that  we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time to a stranger presented to them in the lab who was in distress. After watching this video  an hour later  rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person  a stranger  as someone who's poor  suggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical  but are so malleable to slight changes in people's values  and little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy. And beyond the walls of our lab  we're even beginning to see  signs of change in society. Bill Gates  one of our nation's wealthiest individuals  in his Harvard commencement speech  talked about the problem facing society of inequality as being the most daunting challenge  and talked about what must be done to combat it  saying   Humanity's greatest advances are not in its discoveries  but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity.  And there's the Giving Pledge  in which more than     of our nation's wealthiest individuals are pledging half of their fortunes to charity. And there's the emergence of dozens of grassroots movements  like We are the One Percent  the Resource Generation  or Wealth for Common Good  in which the most privileged members of the population  members of the one percent and elsewhere  people who are wealthy  are using their own economic resources  adults and youth alike  that's what's most striking to me  leveraging their own privilege  their own economic resources  to combat inequality by advocating for social policies  changes in social values  and changes in people's behavior  that work against their own economic interests but that may ultimately restore the American dream. Thank you. It's the fifth time I stand on this shore  the Cuban shore  looking out at that distant horizon  believing  again  that I'm going to make it all the way across that vast  dangerous wilderness of an ocean. Not only have I tried four times  but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since       and it's still never been done. The team is proud of our four attempts. It's an expedition of some    people. Bonnie is my best friend and head handler  who somehow summons will  that last drop of will within me  when I think it's gone  after many  many hours and days out there. The shark experts are the best in the world    large predators below. The box jellyfish  the deadliest venom in all of the ocean  is in these waters  and I have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt. The conditions themselves  besides the sheer distance of over     miles in the open ocean    the currents and whirling eddies and the Gulf Stream itself  the most unpredictable of all of the planet Earth. And by the way  it's amusing to me that journalists and people before these attempts often ask me   Well  are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything   And I'm thinking  what are they imagining  That I'll just sort of do some celestial navigation  and carry a bowie knife in my mouth  and I'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them  and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water. Yes  I have a team.  Laughter  And the team is expert  and the team is courageous  and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery  as is true with any major expedition on the planet. And we've been on a journey. And the debate has raged  hasn't it  since the Greeks  of isn't it what it's all about  Isn't life about the journey  not really the destination  And here we've been on this journey  and the truth is  it's been thrilling. We haven't reached that other shore  and still our sense of pride and commitment  unwavering commitment. When I turned     the dream was still alive from having tried this in my   s  and dreamed it and imagined it. The most famous body of water on the Earth today  I imagine  Cuba to Florida. And it was deep. It was deep in my soul. And when I turned     it wasn't so much about the athletic accomplishment  it wasn't the ego of  I want to be the first.  That's always there and it's undeniable. But it was deeper. It was  how much life is there left  Let's face it  we're all on a one way street  aren't we  and what are we going to do  What are we going to do as we go forward to have no regrets looking back  And all this past year in training  I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote to paraphrase it  floating around in my brain  and it says   You go ahead  you go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair and you be the critic  you be the observer  while the brave one gets in the ring and engages and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails over and over and over again  but yet isn't afraid and isn't timid and lives life in a bold way.  And so of course I want to make it across. It is the goal  and I should be so shallow to say that this year  the destination was even sweeter than the journey. But the journey itself was worthwhile taking. And at this point  by this summer  everybody    scientists  sports scientists  endurance experts  neurologists  my own team  Bonnie    said it's impossible. It just simply can't be done  and Bonnie said to me   But if you're going to take the journey  I'm going to see you through to the end of it  so I'll be there.  And now we're there. And as we're looking out  kind of a surreal moment before the first stroke  standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway  the Cuban flag is flying above  all my team's out in their boats  hands up in the air   We're here  we're here for you   Bonnie and I look at each other  and we say  this year  the mantra is    and I've been using it in training    find a way. You have a dream and you have obstacles in front of you  as we all do. None of us ever get through this life without heartache  without turmoil  and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a great human quality  you find your way  and Bonnie grabbed my shoulders  and she said   Let's find our way to Florida.  And we started  and for the next    hours  it was an intense  unforgettable life experience. The highs were high  the awe  I'm not a religious person  but I'll tell you  to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream as if  as you're breathing  you're looking down miles and miles and miles  to feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on  it's awe inspiring. I have a playlist of about    songs  and especially in the middle of the night  and that night  because we use no lights    lights attract jellyfish  lights attract sharks  lights attract baitfish that attract sharks  so we go in the pitch black of the night. You've never seen black this black. You can't see the front of your hand  and the people on the boat  Bonnie and my team on the boat  they just hear the slapping of the arms  and they know where I am  because there's no visual at all. And I'm out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist. I've got a tight rubber cap  so I don't hear a thing. I've got goggles and I'm turning my head    times a minute  and I'm singing    Imagine there's no heaven     doo doo doo doo doo     It's easy if you try     doo doo doo doo doo   And I can sing that song a thousand times in a row. Now there's a talent unto itself. And each time I get done with   Ooh  you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one      .   Imagine there's no heaven   And when I get through the end of a thousand of John Lennon's  Imagine   I have swum nine hours and    minutes  exactly. And then there are the crises. Of course there are. And the vomiting starts  the seawater  you're not well  you're wearing a jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection. It's difficult to swim in. It's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth  but the tentacles can't get you. And the hypothermia sets in. The water's    degrees  and yet you're losing weight and using calories  and as you come over toward the side of the boat  not allowed to touch it  not allowed to get out  but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and asks me what I'm doing  am I all right  I am seeing the Taj Mahal over here. I'm in a very different state  and I'm thinking  wow  I never thought I'd be running into the Taj Mahal out here. It's gorgeous. I mean  how long did it take them to build that  It's just    So  uh  wooo.  Laughter  And then we kind of have a cardinal rule that I'm never told  really  how far it is  because we don't know how far it is. What's going to happen to you between this point and that point  What's going to happen to the weather and the currents and  God forbid  you're stung when you don't think you could be stung in all this armor  and Bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning that I was suffering and I was hanging on by a thread and she said   Come here   and I came close to the boat  and she said   Look  look out there   and I saw light  because the day's easier than the night  and I thought we were coming into day  and I saw a stream of white light along the horizon  and I said   It's going to be morning soon.  And she said   No  those are the lights of Key West.  It was    more hours  which for most swimmers would be a long time. You have no idea how many    hour training swims I had done. So here we go  and I somehow  without a decision  went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting Stephen Hawking and the parameters of the universe  I just went into thinking about this dream  and why  and how. And as I said  when I turned     it wasn't about that concrete  Can you do it   That's the everyday machinations. That's the discipline  and it's the preparation  and there's a pride in that. But I decided to think  as I went along  about  the phrase usually is reaching for the stars  and in my case  it's reaching for the horizon. And when you reach for the horizon  as I've proven  you may not get there  but what a tremendous build of character and spirit that you lay down. What a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons. And now the shore is coming  and there's just a little part of me that's sad. The epic journey is going to be over. So many people come up to me now and say   What's next  We love that  That little tracker that was on the computer  When are you going to do the next one  We just can't wait to follow the next one.  Well  they were just there for    hours  and I was there for years. And so there won't be another epic journey in the ocean. But the point is  and the point was that every day of our lives is epic  and I'll tell you  when I walked up onto that beach  staggered up onto that beach  and I had so many times in a very puffed up ego way  rehearsed what I would say on the beach. When Bonnie thought that the back of my throat was swelling up  and she brought the medical team over to our boat to say that she's really beginning to have trouble breathing. Another        hours in the saltwater  the whole thing    and I just thought in my hallucinatory moment  that I heard the word tracheotomy. And Bonnie said to the doctor   I'm not worried about her not breathing. If she can't talk when she gets to the shore  she's gonna be pissed off.  But the truth is  all those orations that I had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation  it wasn't like that. It was a very real moment  with that crowd  with my team. We did it. I didn't do it. We did it. And we'll never forget it. It'll always be part of us. And the three things that I did sort of blurt out when we got there  was first   Never  ever give up.  I live it. What's the phrase from today from Socrates  To be is to do. So I don't stand up and say  don't ever give up. I didn't give up  and there was action behind these words. The second is   You can chase your dreams at any age  you're never too old.  Sixty four  that no one at any age  any gender  could ever do  has done it  and there's no doubt in my mind that I am at the prime of my life today. Yeah. Thank you. And the third thing I said on that beach was   It looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world  and in many ways  of course  it is  and in other ways  and the most important ways  it's a team  and if you think I'm a badass  you want to meet Bonnie.  Bonnie  where are you  Where are you  There's Bonnie Stoll.  Applause  My buddy. The Henry David Thoreau quote goes  when you achieve your dreams  it's not so much what you get as who you have become in achieving them. And yeah  I stand before you now. In the three months since that swim ended  I've sat down with Oprah and I've been in President Obama's Oval Office. I've been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups such as yourselves. I've signed a wonderful major book contract. All of that's great  and I don't denigrate it. I'm proud of it all  but the truth is  I'm walking around tall because I am that bold  fearless person  and I will be  every day  until it's time for these days to be done. Thank you very much and enjoy the conference. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Find a way   Applause  How many of you have been to Oklahoma City  Raise your hand. Yeah  How many of you have not been to Oklahoma City and have no idea who I am   Laughter  Most of you. Let me give you a little bit of background. Oklahoma City started in the most unique way imaginable. Back on a spring day in       the federal government held what they called a land run. They literally lined up the settlers along an imaginary line  and they fired off a gun  and the settlers roared across the countryside and put down a stake  and wherever they put down that stake  that was their new home. And at the end of the very first day  the population of Oklahoma City had gone from zero to         and our planning department is still paying for that. The citizens got together on that first day and elected a mayor. And then they shot him. That's not really all that funny     Laughter     but it allows me to see what type of audience I'm dealing with  so I appreciate the feedback. The   th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City. Our economy was based on commodities  so the price of cotton or the price of wheat  and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas. And along the way  we became a city of innovation. The shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City. The parking meter  invented in Oklahoma City. You're welcome. Having an economy  though  that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs  and that was certainly the case in Oklahoma City's history. In the     s  when it appeared that the price of energy would never retreat  our economy was soaring  and then in the early     s  it cratered quickly. The price of energy dropped. Our banks began to fail. Before the end of the decade      banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma. There was no bailout on the horizon. Our banking industry  our oil and gas industry  our commercial real estate industry  were all at the bottom of the economic scale. Young people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves for Washington and Dallas and Houston and New York and Tokyo  anywhere where they could  find a job that measured up to their educational attainment  because in Oklahoma City  the good jobs just weren't there. But along at the end of the '  s came an enterprising businessman who became mayor named Ron Norick. Ron Norick eventually figured out that the secret to economic development wasn't incentivizing companies up front  it was about creating a place where businesses wanted to locate  and so he pushed an initiative called MAPS that basically was a penny on the dollar sales tax to build a bunch of stuff. It built a new sports arena  a new canal downtown  it fixed up our performing arts center  a new baseball stadium downtown  a lot of things to improve the quality of life. And the economy indeed seemed to start showing some signs of life. The next mayor came along. He started MAPS for Kids  rebuilt the entire inner city school system  all    buildings either built anew or refurbished. And then  in       in this rare collective lack of judgment bordering on civil disobedience  the citizens elected me mayor. Now the city I inherited was just on the verge of coming out of its slumbering economy  and for the very first time  we started showing up on the lists. Now you know the lists I'm talking about. The media and the Internet love to rank cities. And in Oklahoma City  we'd never really been on lists before. So I thought it was kind of cool when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there. We weren't anywhere close to the top  but we were on the list  we were somebody. Best city to get a job  best city to start a business  best downtown    Oklahoma City. And then came the list of the most obese cities in the country. And there we were. Now I like to point out that we were on that list with a lot of really cool places. Dallas and Houston and New Orleans and Atlanta and Miami. You know  these are cities that  typically  you're not embarrassed to be associated with. But nonetheless  I didn't like being on the list. And about that time  I got on the scales. And I weighed     pounds. And then I went to this website sponsored by the federal government  and I typed in my height  I typed in my weight  and I pushed Enter  and it came back and said  obese.  I thought   What a stupid website.   I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese.  And then I started getting honest with myself about what had become my lifelong struggle with obesity  and I noticed this pattern  that I was gaining about two or three pounds a year  and then about every    years  I'd drop    or    pounds. And then I'd do it again. And I had this huge closet full of clothes  and I could only wear a third of it at any one time  and only I knew which part of the closet I could wear. But it all seemed fairly normal  going through it. Well  I finally decided I needed to lose weight  and I knew I could because I'd done it so many times before  so I simply stopped eating as much. I had always exercised. That really wasn't the part of the equation that I needed to work on. But I had been eating       calories a day  and I cut it to       calories a day  and the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week for about    weeks. Along the way  though  I started examining my city  its culture  its infrastructure  trying to figure out why our specific city seemed to have a problem with obesity. And I came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car. But if you happen to be a person  you are combatting the car seemingly at every turn. Our city is very spread out. We have a great intersection of highways  I mean  literally no traffic congestion in Oklahoma City to speak of. And so people live far  far away. Our city limits are enormous      square miles  but    miles is less than    minutes. You literally can get a speeding ticket during rush hour in Oklahoma City. And as a result  people tend to spread out. Land's cheap. We had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments  for a long  long time. We had fixed that  but it had been relatively recently  and there were literally         or more homes into our inventory in neighborhoods that had  virtually no level of walkability. And as I tried to examine how we might deal with obesity  and was taking all of these elements into my mind  I decided that the first thing we need to do was have a conversation. You see  in Oklahoma City  we weren't talking about obesity. And so  on New Year's Eve of       I went to the zoo  and I stood in front of the elephants  and I said   This city is going on a diet  and we're going to lose a million pounds.  Well  that's when all hell broke loose. The national media gravitated toward this story immediately  and they really could have  gone with it one of two ways. They could have said   This city is so fat that the mayor had to put them on a diet.  But fortunately  the consensus was   Look  this is a problem in a lot of places. This is a city that's wanting to do something about it.  And so they started helping us drive traffic to the website. Now  the web address was thiscityisgoingonadiet.com. And I appeared on  The Ellen DeGeneres Show  one weekday morning to talk about the initiative  and on that day          visits were placed to our website. People were signing up  and so the pounds started to add up  and the conversation that I thought was so important to have was starting to take place. It was taking place inside the homes  mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids. It was taking place in churches. Churches were starting their own running groups and their own support groups for people who were dealing with obesity. Suddenly  it was a topic worth discussing at schools and in the workplace. And the large companies  they typically have wonderful wellness programs  but the medium sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this  they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others. And then came the next stage of the equation. It was time to push what I called MAPS  . Now MAPS    like the other two programs  had had an economic development motive behind it  but along with the traditional economic development tasks like building a new convention center  we added some health related infrastructure to the process. We added a new central park     acres in size  to be right downtown in Oklahoma City. We're building a downtown streetcar to try and help the walkability formula for people who choose to live in the inner city and help us create the density there. We're building senior health and wellness centers throughout the community. We put some investments on the river that had originally been invested upon in the original MAPS  and now we are currently in the final stages of developing the finest venue in the world for the sports of canoe  kayak and rowing. We hosted the Olympic trials last spring. We have Olympic caliber events coming to Oklahoma City  and athletes from all over the world moving in  along with inner city programs to get kids more engaged in these types of recreational activities that are a little bit nontraditional. We also  with another initiative that was passed  are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks throughout the metro area. We're even going back into some inner city situations where we had built neighborhoods and we had built schools but we had not connected the two. We had built libraries and we had built neighborhoods  but we had never really connected the two with any sort of walkability. Through yet another funding source  we're redesigning all of our inner city streets to be more pedestrian friendly. Our streets were really wide  and you'd push the button to allow you to walk across  and you had to run in order to get there in time. But now we've narrowed the streets  highly landscaped them  making them more pedestrian friendly  really a redesign  rethinking the way we build our infrastructure  designing a city around people and not cars. We're completing our bicycle trail master plan. We'll have over     miles when we're through building it out. And so you see this culture starting to shift in Oklahoma City. And lo and behold  the demographic changes that are coming with it are very inspiring. Highly educated twentysomethings are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region and  indeed  even from further away  in California. When we reached a million pounds  in January of       I flew to New York with some our participants who had lost over     pounds  whose lives had been changed  and we appeared on the Rachael Ray show  and then that afternoon  I did a round of media in New York pushing the same messages that you're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it. And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine  the same magazine that had put us on that list five years before. And as I'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter  I notice there's a magazine copy of the current issue right there on the table  and I pick it up  and I look at the headline across the top  and it says   America's Fattest Cities  Do You Live in One   Well  I knew I did  so I picked up the magazine and I began to look  and we weren't on it. Then I looked on the list of fittest cities  and we were on that list. We were on the list as the   nd fittest city in the United States. Our state health statistics are doing better. Granted  we have a long way to go. Health is still not something that we should be proud of in Oklahoma City  but we seem to have turned the cultural shift of making health a greater priority. And we love the idea of the demographics of highly educated twentysomethings  people with choices  choosing Oklahoma City in large numbers. We have the lowest unemployment in the United States  probably the strongest economy in the United States. And if you're like me  at some point in your educational career  you were asked to read a book called  The Grapes of Wrath.  Oklahomans leaving for California in large numbers for a better future. When we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west  it appears that what we're seeing now is the wrath of grapes. The grandchildren are coming home. You've been a great audience and very attentive. Thank you very much for having me here. Hello  TEDWomen  what's up. Not good enough. Hello  TEDWomen  what is up  My name is Maysoon Zayid  and I am not drunk  but the doctor who delivered me was. He cut my mom six different times in six different directions  suffocating poor little me in the process. As a result  I have cerebral palsy  which means I shake all the time. Look. It's exhausting. I'm like Shakira  Shakira meets Muhammad Ali. CP is not genetic. It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it. No one put a curse on my mother's uterus  and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins  which they are. It only happens from accidents  like what happened to me on my birth day. Now  I must warn you  I'm not inspirational. And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me  because at some point in your life  you have dreamt of being disabled. Come on a journey with me. It's Christmas Eve  you're at the mall  you're driving around in circles looking for parking  and what do you see  Sixteen empty handicapped spaces. And you're like   God  can't I just be a little disabled   Also  I've got to tell you  I've got    problems  and palsy is just one. If there was an Oppression Olympics  I would win the gold medal. I'm Palestinian  Muslim  I'm female  I'm disabled  and I live in New Jersey. If you don't feel better about yourself  maybe you should. Cliffside Park  New Jersey is my hometown. I have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials. I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City  I could. A lot of people with CP don't walk  but my parents didn't believe in  can't.  My father's mantra was   You can do it  yes you can can.  So  if my three older sisters were mopping  I was mopping. If my three older sisters went to public school  my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went too  and if we didn't all get A's  we all got my mother's slipper. My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking. Another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it. My inner stripper was very strong. Yeah. No  by the first day of kindergarten  I was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times. Growing up  there were only six Arabs in my town  and they were all my family. Now there are    Arabs in town  and they are still all my family. I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian. This was before      and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use  I hate Muslims  as a campaign slogan. The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith. They did  however  seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan. I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months  so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake. I have tap danced on Broadway. Yeah  on Broadway. It's crazy. My parents couldn't afford physical therapy  so they sent me to dancing school. I learned how to dance in heels  which means I can walk in heels. And I'm from Jersey  and we are really concerned with being chic  so if my friends wore heels  so did I. And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the Jersey Shore  I did not. I spent my summers in a war zone  because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer  we'd grow up to be Madonna. Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me  so I drank deer's milk  I had hot cups on my back  I was dunked in the Dead Sea  and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking   It's working  It's working   But one miracle cure we did find was yoga. I have to tell you  it's very boring  but before I did yoga  I was a stand up comedian who can't stand up. And now I can stand on my head. My parents reinforced this notion that I could do anything  that no dream was impossible  and my dream was to be on the daytime soap opera  General Hospital.  I went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to ASU  Arizona State University  because I fit every single quota. I was like the pet lemur of the theater department. Everybody loved me. I did all the less than intelligent kids' homework  I got A's in all of my classes  A's in all of their classes. Every time I did a scene from  The Glass Menagerie   my professors would weep. But I never got cast. Finally  my senior year  ASU decided to do a show called  They Dance Real Slow in Jackson.  It's a play about a girl with CP. I was a girl with CP. So I start shouting from the rooftops   I'm finally going to get a part  I have cerebral palsy  Free at last  Free at last  Thank God almighty  I'm free at last   I didn't get the part. Sherry Brown got the part. I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically  like someone shot my cat  to ask her why  and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts. I said   Excuse me  if I can't do the stunts  neither can the character.  This was a part that I was literally born to play they gave it to a non palsy actress. College was imitating life. Hollywood has a sordid history of casting able bodied actors to play disabled onscreen. Upon graduating  I moved back home  and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera. My dream was coming true. And I knew that I would be promoted from  Diner Diner  to  Wacky Best Friend  in no time. But instead  I remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head  and it became clear to me that casting directors didn't hire fluffy  ethnic  disabled actors. They only hired perfect people. But there were exceptions to the rule. I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg  Roseanne Barr  Ellen  and all of these women had one thing in common  they were comedians. So I became a comic. My first gig was driving famous comics from New York City to shows in New Jersey  and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike with a chick with CP driving him. I've performed in clubs all over America  and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East  uncensored and uncovered. Some people say I'm the first stand up comic in the Arab world. I never like to claim first  but I do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny  and they find us hysterical. In       my brother from another mother and father Dean Obeidallah and I started the New York Arab American Comedy Festival  now in its   th year. Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab Americans in media  while also reminding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous. Mainstreaming Arabs was much  much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability. My big break came in     . I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show  Countdown with Keith Olbermann.  I walked in looking like I was going to the prom  and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning  rolling chair. So I looked at the stage manager and I'm like   Excuse me  can I have another chair   And she looked at me and she went   Five  four  three  two ...  And we were live  right  So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment  and when the interview was over  I was livid. I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it  and I knew I would never get invited back. But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back  he made me a full time contributor  and he taped down my chair. One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann was that humans on the Internet are scumbags. People say children are cruel  but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult. Suddenly  my disability on the world wide web is fair game. I would look at clips online and see comments like   Yo  why's she tweakin'    Yo  is she retarded   And my favorite   Poor Gumby mouth terrorist. What does she suffer from  We should really pray for her.  One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits  screenwriter  comedian  palsy. Disability is as visual as race. If a wheelchair user can't play Beyonc   then Beyonc  can't play a wheelchair user. The disabled are the largest   Yeah  clap for that  man. Come on. People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world  and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment. The doctors said that I wouldn't walk  but I am here in front of you. However  if I grew up with social media  I don't think I would be. I hope that together  we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life. Perhaps if there were more positive images  it would foster less hate on the Internet. Or maybe not. Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well. My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places. I got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci and the iconic Loreen Arbus. I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler and work with my idol  the amazing Dave Matthews. I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild. I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the      DNC. And I founded Maysoon's Kids  a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me. But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got    before this moment    But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee  has Parkinson's and shakes just like me  Muhammad Ali. It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live  and I dedicate this talk to his memory. and if I can can  you can can. Good morning  Are you awake  They took my name tag  but I wanted to ask you  did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic  Anyone  No one  All right  no problem. Once upon a time  not long ago  I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend  ordering food. So I looked at the waiter and said   Do you have a menu  Arabic    He looked at me strangely  thinking that he misheard. He said   Sorry   English .  I said   The menu  Arabic   please.  He replied   Don't you know what they call it    I do.  He said   No  It's called  menu   English   or  menu   French .  Is the French pronunciation correct   Come  come  take care of this one   said the waiter. He was disgusted when talking to me  as if he was saying to himself   If this was the last girl on Earth  I wouldn't look at her   What's the meaning of saying  menu  in Arabic  Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant. How could she speak that way  At that moment  I started thinking. It made me mad. It definitely hurts  I'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country  Where could this happen  How did we get here  Well  while we are here  there are many people like me  who would reach a stage in their lives  where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past  just so they can say that they're modern and civilized. Should I forget all my culture  thoughts  intellect and all my memories  Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war  Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic  just to conform  To be one of them  Where's the logic in that  Despite all that  I tried to understand him. I didn't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me. The Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs. It's not a language for science  research  a language we're used to in universities  a language we use in the workplace  a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project  and it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport. If we did so  they'd strip us of our clothes. Where can I use it  then  We could all ask this question  So  you want us to use Arabic. Where are we to do so  This is one reality. But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about. Arabic is the mother tongue. Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue. Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages. How  Gibran Khalil Gibran  when he first started writing  he used Arabic. All his ideas  imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up  smelling a specific smell  hearing a specific voice  and thinking a specific thought. So  when he started writing in English  he had enough baggage. Even when he wrote in English  when you read his writings in English  you smell the same smell  sense the same feeling. You can imagine that that's him writing in English  the same boy who came from the mountain. From a village on Mount Lebanon. So  this is an example no one can argue with. Second  it's often said that if you want to kill a nation  the only way to kill a nation  is to kill its language. This is a reality that developed societies are aware of. The Germans  French  Japanese and Chinese  all these nations are aware of this. That's why they legislate to protect their language. They make it sacred. That's why they use it in production  they pay a lot of money to develop it. Do we know better than them  All right  we aren't from the developed world  this advanced thinking hasn't reached us yet  and we would like to catch up with the civilized world. Countries that were once like us  but decided to strive for development  do research  and catch up with those countries  such as Turkey  Malaysia and others  they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder  protected it like a diamond. They kept it close to them. Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it's not labeled in Turkish  then it isn't a local product. You wouldn't believe it's a local product. They'd go back to being consumers  clueless consumers  like we are most of the time. So  in order for them to innovate and produce  they had to protect their language. If I say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence  Arabic    what does this remind you of  It doesn't ring a bell  does it  Regardless of the who  how and why. Language isn't just for conversing  just words coming out of our mouths. Language represents specific stages in our lives  and terminology that is linked to our emotions. So when we say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence   each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind  there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period. Language isn't one  two or three words or letters put together. It's an idea inside that relates to how we think  and how we see each other and how others see us. What is our intellect  How do you say whether this guy understands or not  So  if I say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence  English    or if your son came up to you and said   Dad  have you lived through the period of the freedom  English  slogan   How would you feel  If you don't see a problem  then I'd better leave  and stop talking in vain. The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing. I have a francophone friend who's married to a French man. I asked her once how things were going. She said   Everything is fine  but once  I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word 'toqborni' for him.  The poor woman had mistakenly told him  toqborni   and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him. He was puzzled by the thought   How could anyone be this cruel  Does she want to commit suicide  'Bury me '  English   This is one of the few examples. It made us feel that she's unable to tell that word to her husband  since he won't understand  and he's right not to  his way of thinking is different. She said to me   He listens to Fairuz with me  and one night  I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz.  The poor woman tried to translate this for him   From them I extended my hands and stole you     And here's the pickle   And because you belong to them  I returned my hands and left you.  Translate that for me. So  what have we done to protect the Arabic language  We turned this into a concern of the civil society  and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language. Even though many people told me   Why do you bother  Forget about this headache and go have fun.  No problem  The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says   I talk to you from the East  but you reply from the West.  We didn't say   No  We do not accept this or that.  We didn't adopt this style because that way  we wouldn't be understood. And when someone talks to me that way  I hate the Arabic language. We say   We want to change our reality  and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams  aspirations and day to day life. In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do. So   I talk to you from the East  but you reply from the West  has hit the spot. Something very easy  yet creative and persuasive. After that  we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground. You've seen an example of it outside  a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with  Don't kill your language   written on it. Why  Seriously  don't kill your language. We really shouldn't kill our language. If we were to kill the language  we'd have to find an identity. We'd have to find an existence. We'd go back to the beginning. This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized. After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter. Photos of  cool  guys and girls. We are very cool  And to whoever might say   Ha  You used an English word   I say   No  I adopt the word 'cool.'  Let them object however they want  but give me a word that's nicer and matches the reality better. I will keep on saying  Internet  I wouldn't say   I'm going to the world wide web  Because it doesn't fit  We shouldn't kid ourselves. But to reach this point  we all have to be convinced that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language  to control us or make us think and feel what they want. Creativity is the idea. So  if we can't reach space or build a rocket and so on  we can be creative. At this moment  every one of you is a creative project. Creativity in your mother tongue is the path. Let's start from this moment. Let's write a novel or produce a short film. A single novel could make us global again. It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one. So  it's not true that there's no solution  there is a solution  But we have to know that  and be convinced that a solution exists  that we have a duty to be part of that solution. In conclusion  what can you do today  Now  tweets  who's tweeting  Please  I beg of you  even though my time has finished  either Arabic  English  French or Chinese. But don't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers  It's a disaster  That's not a language. You'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language. It's not easy to come back from such a place and rise. That's the first thing we can do. Second  there are many other things that we can do. We're not here today to convince each other. We're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language. Now I will tell you a secret. A baby first identifies its father through language. When my daughter is born  I'll tell her   This is your father  honey  Arabic .  I wouldn't say   This is your dad  honey  English .  And in the supermarket  I promise my daughter Noor  that if she says to me   Thanks  Arabic    I won't say   Dis  'Merci  Maman '  and hope no one has heard her. Let's get rid of this cultural cringe. So this is a picture of my dad and me at the beach in Far Rockaway  or actually Rockaway Park. I'm the one with the blond hair. My dad's the guy with the cigarette. It was the '  s. A lot of people smoked back then. In the summer of       my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer. Cancer is one of those things that actually touches everybody. If you're a man in the United States of the America  you've got about a one in two chance of being diagnosed with cancer during your lifetime. If you're a woman  you've got about a one in three chance of being diagnosed with cancer. Everybody knows somebody who's been diagnosed with cancer. Now  my dad's doing better today  and part of the reason for that is that he was able to participate in the trial of an experimental new drug that happened to be specially formulated and very good for his particular kind of cancer. There are over     kinds of cancer. And what I want to talk about today is how we can help more people like my dad  because we have to change the way we think about raising money to fund cancer research. So a while after my dad was diagnosed  I was having coffee with my friend Andrew Lo. He's the head of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MIT  where I also have a position  and we were talking about cancer. And Andrew had been doing his own bits of research  and one of the things that he had been told and that he'd learned from studying the literature was that there's actually a big bottleneck. It's very difficult to develop new drugs  and the reason it's difficult to develop new drugs is because in the early stages of drug development  the drugs are very risky  and they're very expensive. So Andrew asked me if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit  work on some of the math and the analytics and see if we could figure out something we could do. Now I'm not a scientist. You know  I don't know how to build a drug. And none of my coauthors  Andrew Lo or Jose Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan    none of those guys    are scientists either. We don't know the first thing about how to make a cancer drug. But we know a little bit about risk mitigation and a little bit about financial engineering  and so we started thinking  what could we do  What I'm going to tell you about is some work we've been doing over the last couple years that we think could fundamentally change the way research for cancer and lots of other things gets done. We want to let the research drive the funding  not the other way around. So in order to get started  let me tell you how you get a drug financed. Imagine that you're in your lab    you're a scientist  you're not like me    you're a scientist  and you've developed a new compound that you think might be therapeutic for somebody with cancer. Well  what you do is  you test in animals  you test in test tubes  but there's this notion of going from the bench to the bedside  and in order to get from the bench  the lab  to the bedside  to the patients  you've got to get the drug tested. And the way the drug gets tested is through a series of  basically  experiments  through these large  they're called trials  that they do to determine whether the drug is safe and whether it works and all these things. So the FDA has a very specific protocol. In the first phase of this testing  which is called testing for toxicity  it's called Phase I. In the first phase  you give the drug to healthy people and you see if it actually makes them sick. In other words  are the side effects just so severe that no matter how much good it does  it's not going to be worth it  Does it cause heart attacks  kill people  liver failure  this kind of thing  And it turns out  that's a pretty high hurdle. About a third of all drugs drop out at that point. In the next phase  you test to see if the drug's effective  and what you do there is you give it to people with cancer and you see if it actually makes them better. And that's also a higher hurdle. People drop out. And in the third phase  you actually test it on a very large sample  and what you're trying to determine is what the right dose is  and also  is it better than what's available today  If not  then why build it  When you're done with all that  what you have is a very small percentage of drugs that start the process actually come out the other side. So those blue bottles  those blue bottles save lives  and they're also worth billions  sometimes billions a year. So now here's a question  if I were to ask you  for example  to make a one time investment of  say      million dollars to buy one of those bottles  so     million dollars up front  one time  to buy one of those bottles  I won't tell you which one it is  and in    years  I'll tell you whether you have one of the blue ones. Does that sound like a good deal for anybody  No. No  right  And of course  it's a very  very risky trial position  and that's why it's very hard to get funding  but to a first approximation  that's actually the proposal. You have to fund these things from the early stages on. It takes a long time. So Andrew said to me  he said   What if we stop thinking about these as drugs  What if we start thinking about them as financial assets   They've got really weird payoff structures and all that  but let's throw everything we know about financial engineering at them. Let's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade to figure out how to make these drugs work as financial assets  Let's create a giant fund. In finance  we know what to do with assets that are risky. You put them in a portfolio and you try to smooth out the returns. So we did some math  and it turned out you could make this work  but in order to make it work  you need about    to     drugs. Now the good news is  there's plenty of drugs that are waiting to be tested. We've been told that there's a backlog of about    years of drugs that are waiting to be tested but can't be funded. In fact  that early stage of the funding process  that Phase I and pre clinical stuff  that's actually  in the industry   called the Valley of Death because it's where drugs go to die. It's very hard to for them to get through there  and of course  if you can't get through there  you can't get to the later stages. So we did this math  and we figured out  okay  well  you know  you need about    to  say       or something like that  drugs. And then we did a little more math  and we said  okay  well that's a fund of about three to    billion dollars. So we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one. We were able to get rid of the risk  but now we need a lot of capital  and there's only one place to get that kind of capital  the capital markets. Venture capitalists don't have it. Philanthropies don't have it. But we have to figure out how we can get people in the capital markets  who traditionally don't invest in this stuff  to want to invest in this stuff. So again  financial engineering was helpful here. Imagine the megafund actually starts empty  and what it does is it issues some debt and some equity  and that generates cash flow. That cash flow is used  then  to buy that big portfolio of drugs that you need  and those drugs start working their way through that approval process  and each time they go through a next phase of approval  they gain value. And most of them don't make it  but a few of them do  and with the ones that gain value  you can sell some  and when you sell them  you have money to pay the interest on those bonds  but you also have money to fund the next round of trials. It's almost self funding. You do that for the course of the transaction  and when you're done  you liquidate the portfolio  pay back the bonds  and you can give the equity holders a nice return. So that was the theory  and we talked about it for a bit  we did a bunch of experiments  and then we said  let's really try to test it. We spent the next two years doing research. We talked to hundreds of experts in drug financing and venture capital. We talked to people who have developed drugs. We talked to pharmaceutical companies. We actually looked at the data for drugs  over       drugs that had been approved or denied or withdrawn  and we also ran millions of simulations. And all that actually took a lot of time. But when we were done  what we found was something that was sort of surprising. It was actually feasible to structure that fund such that when you were done structuring it  you could actually produce low risk bonds that would be attractive to bond holders  that would give you yields of about five to eight percent  and you could produce equity that would give equity holders about a    percent return. Now those returns aren't going to be attractive to a venture capitalist. Venture capitalists are those guys who want to make those big bets and get those billion dollar payoffs. But it turns out  there are lots of other folks that would be interested in that. That's right in the investment sweet spot of pension funds and     k  plans and all this other stuff. So we published some articles in the academic press. We published articles in medical journals. We published articles in finance journals. But it wasn't until we actually got the popular press interested in this that we began to get some traction. We wanted to do something more than just make people aware of it  though. We wanted people to get involved. So what we did was  we actually took all of our computer code and made that available online under an open source license to anybody that wanted it. And you guys can download it today if you want to run your own experiments to see if this would work. And that was really effective  because people that didn't believe our assumptions could try their own assumptions and see how it would work. Now there's an obvious problem  which is  is there enough money in the world to fund this stuff  I've told you there's enough drugs  but is there enough money  There's     trillion dollars of capital currently invested in fixed income securities. That's a hundred thousand billion. There's plenty of money. But what we realized was that it's more than just money that's required. We had to get people motivated  people to get involved  and people had to understand this. And so we started thinking about all  the different things that could go wrong. What are all the challenges to doing  this that might get in the way  And we had a long list  and so what we did was we assigned a bunch of people  including ourselves  different pieces of this problem  and we said  could you start a work stream on credit risk  Could you start a work stream on the regulatory aspects  Could you start a work stream on how you would actually manage so many projects  And we had all these experts get together and do these different work streams  and then we held a conference. The conference was held over the summer  this past summer. It was an invitation only conference. It was sponsored by the American Cancer Society and done in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute. And we had experts from every field that we thought would be important  including the government  including people that run research centers and so on  and for two days they sat around and heard the reports from those five work streams  and they talked about it. It was the first time that the people who could actually make this happen sat across the table from each other and had these conversations. Now these conferences  it's typical to have a dinner  and at that dinner  you kind of get to know each other  sort of like what we're doing here. I happened to look out the window  and hand on my heart  I looked out the window on the night of this conference    it was the summertime    and that's what I saw  it was a double rainbow. So I'd like to think it was a good sign. Since the conference  we've got people working between Paris and San Francisco  lots of different folks working on this to try to see if we can really make it happen. We're not looking to start a fund  but we want somebody else to do this. Because  again  I'm not a scientist. I can't build a drug. I'm never going to have enough money to fund even one of those trials. But all of us together  with our     k 's  with our     plans  with our pension plans  all of us together can actually fund hundreds of trials and get paid well for doing it and save millions of lives like my dad. Thank you. Three and a half years ago  I made one of the best decisions of my life. As my New Year's resolution  I gave up dieting  stopped worrying about my weight  and learned to eat mindfully. Now I eat whenever I'm hungry  and I've lost    pounds. This was me at age     when I started my first diet. I look at that picture now  and I think  you did not need a diet  you needed a fashion consult. But I thought I needed to lose weight  and when I gained it back  of course I blamed myself. And for the next three decades  I was on and off various diets. No matter what I tried  the weight I'd lost always came back. I'm sure many of you know the feeling. As a neuroscientist  I wondered  why is this so hard  Obviously  how much you weigh depends on how much you eat and how much energy you burn. What most people don't realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain  mostly without your awareness. Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes  and that is a good thing  because your conscious mind    how do we put this politely     it's easily distracted. It's good that you don't have to remember to breathe when you get caught up in a movie. You don't forget how to walk because you're thinking about what to have for dinner. Your brain also has its own sense of what you should weigh  no matter what you consciously believe. This is called your set point  but that's a misleading term  because it's actually a range of about    or    pounds. You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range  but it's much  much harder to stay outside of it. The hypothalamus  the part of the brain that regulates body weight  there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight  more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it  and the system works like a thermostat  responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger  activity and metabolism  to keep your weight stable as conditions change. That's what a thermostat does  right  It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside. Now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter  but that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat  which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up. Your brain works exactly the same way  responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal. If you lose a lot of weight  your brain reacts as if you were starving  and whether you started out fat or thin  your brain's response is exactly the same. We would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not  but it can't. If you do lose a lot of weight  you become hungry  and your muscles burn less energy. Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University has found that people who have lost    percent of their body weight burn     to     calories less because their metabolism is suppressed. That's a lot of food. This means that a successful dieter must eat this much less forever than someone of the same weight who has always been thin. From an evolutionary perspective  your body's resistance to weight loss makes sense. When food was scarce  our ancestors' survival depended on conserving energy  and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage. Over the course of human history  starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating. This may explain a very sad fact  Set points can go up  but they rarely go down. Now  if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair  this is the kind of thing she was talking about. Successful dieting doesn't lower your set point. Even after you've kept the weight off for as long as seven years  your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back. If that weight loss had been due to a long famine  that would be a sensible response. In our modern world of drive thru burgers  it's not working out so well for many of us. That difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available  and it's also the reason that changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution to obesity. Sadly  a temporary weight gain can become permanent. If you stay at a high weight for too long  probably a matter of years for most of us  your brain may decide that that's the new normal. Psychologists classify eaters into two groups  those who rely on their hunger and those who try to control their eating through willpower  like most dieters. Let's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters. The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight  and they spend less time thinking about food. Controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising  super sizing  and the all you can eat buffet. And a small indulgence  like eating one scoop of ice cream  is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters. Children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging. Several long term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later  even if they started at a normal weight  and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders. The other factor  by the way  those of you who are parents  was being teased by family members about their weight. So don't do that. I left almost all my graphs at home  but I couldn't resist throwing in just this one  because I'm a geek  and that's how I roll. This is a study that looked at the risk of death over a    year period based on four healthy habits  eating enough fruits and vegetables  exercise three times a week  not smoking  and drinking in moderation. Let's start by looking at the normal weight people in the study. The height of the bars is the risk of death  and those zero  one  two  three  four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had. And as you'd expect  the healthier the lifestyle  the less likely people were to die during the study. Now let's look at what happens in overweight people. The ones that had no healthy habits had a higher risk of death. Adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range. For obese people with no healthy habits  the risk is very high  seven times higher than the healthiest groups in the study. But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too. In fact  if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits  you can see that weight makes very little difference. You can take control of your health by taking control of your lifestyle  even If you can't lose weight and keep it off. Diets don't have very much reliability. Five years after a diet  most people have regained the weight. Forty percent of them have gained even more. If you think about this  the typical outcome of dieting is that you're more likely to gain weight in the long run than to lose it. If I've convinced you that dieting might be a problem  the next question is  what do you do about it  And my answer  in a word  is mindfulness. I'm not saying you need to learn to meditate or take up yoga. I'm talking about mindful eating  learning to understand your body's signals so that you eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full  because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you're not hungry. How do you do it  Give yourself permission to eat as much as you want  and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel good. Sit down to regular meals without distractions. Think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop  and let your hunger decide when you should be done. It took about a year for me to learn this  but it's really been worth it. I am so much more relaxed around food than I have ever been in my life. I often don't think about it. I forget we have chocolate in the house. It's like aliens have taken over my brain. It's just completely different. I should say that this approach to eating probably won't make you lose weight unless you often eat when you're not hungry  but doctors don't know of any approach that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people  and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on preventing weight gain instead of promoting weight loss. Let's face it  If diets worked  we'd all be thin already. Why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results  Diets may seem harmless  but they actually do a lot of collateral damage. At worst  they ruin lives  Weight obsession leads to eating disorders  especially in young kids. In the U.S.  we have    percent of    year old girls say they've been on a diet. Our daughters have learned to measure their worth by the wrong scale. Even at its best  dieting is a waste of time and energy. It takes willpower which you could be using to help your kids with their homework or to finish that important work project  and because willpower is limited  any strategy that relies on its consistent application is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail you when your attention moves on to something else. Let me leave you with one last thought. What if we told all those dieting girls that it's okay to eat when they're hungry  What if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it  I think most of them would be happier and healthier  and as adults  many of them would probably be thinner. I wish someone had told me that back when I was   . Thanks. This is an image of the planet Earth. It looks very much like the Apollo pictures that are very well known. There is something different  you can click on it  and if you click on it  you can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth. For instance  this is a bird's eye view of the EPFL campus. In many cases  you can also see how a building looks from a nearby street. This is pretty amazing. But there's something missing in this wonderful tour  It's time. i'm not really sure when this picture was taken. I'm not even sure it was taken at the same moment as the bird's eye view. In my lab  we develop tools to travel not only in space but also through time. The kind of question we're asking is Is it possible to build something like Google Maps of the past  Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps and just change the year  seeing how it was     years before        years before  Is that possible  Can I reconstruct social networks of the past  Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages  So  can I build time machines  Maybe we can just say   No  it's not possible.  Or  maybe  we can think of it from an information point of view. This is what I call the information mushroom. Vertically  you have the time. and horizontally  the amount of digital information available. Obviously  in the last    years  we have much information. And obviously the more we go in the past  the less information we have. If we want to build something like Google Maps of the past  or Facebook of the past  we need to enlarge this space  we need to make that like a rectangle. How do we do that  One way is digitization. There's a lot of material available    newspaper  printed books  thousands of printed books. I can digitize all these. I can extract information from these. Of course  the more you go in the past  the less information you will have. So  it might not be enough. So  I can do what historians do. I can extrapolate. This is what we call  in computer science  simulation. If I take a log book  I can consider  it's not just a log book of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey. I can consider it is actually a log book which is representative of many journeys of that period. I'm extrapolating. If I have a painting of a facade  I can consider it's not just that particular building  but probably it also shares the same grammar of buildings where we lost any information. So if we want to construct a time machine  we need two things. We need very large archives  and we need excellent specialists. The Venice Time Machine  the project I'm going to talk to you about  is a joint project between the EPFL and the University of Venice Ca'Foscari. There's something very peculiar about Venice  that its administration has been very  very bureaucratic. They've been keeping track of everything  almost like Google today. At the Archivio di Stato  you have    kilometers of archives documenting every aspect of the life of Venice over more than       years. You have every boat that goes out  every boat that comes in. You have every change that was made in the city. This is all there. We are setting up a    year digitization program which has the objective of transforming this immense archive into a giant information system. The type of objective we want to reach is     books a day that can be digitized. Of course  when you digitize  that's not enough  because these documents  most of them are in Latin  in Tuscan  in Venetian dialect  so you need to transcribe them  to translate them in some cases  to index them  and this is obviously not easy. In particular  traditional optical character recognition method that can be used for printed manuscripts  they do not work well on the handwritten document. So the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain  speech recognition. This is a domain of something  that seems impossible  which can actually be done  simply by putting additional constraints. If you have a very good model of a language which is used  if you have a very good model of a document  how well they are structured. And these are administrative documents. They are well structured in many cases. If you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets where a smaller subset actually shares similar features  then there's a chance of success. If we reach that stage  then there's something else  we can extract from this document events. Actually probably    billion events can be extracted from this archive. And this giant information system can be searched in many ways. You can ask questions like   Who lived in this palazzo in         How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market in         What was the salary of a glass maker in Murano maybe over a decade   You can ask even bigger questions because it will be semantically coded. And then what you can do is put that in space  because much of this information is spatial. And from that  you can do things like reconstructing this extraordinary journey of that city that managed to have a sustainable development over a thousand years  managing to have all the time a form of equilibrium with its environment. You can reconstruct that journey  visualize it in many different ways. But of course  you cannot understand  Venice if you just look at the city. You have to put it in a larger European context. So the idea is also to document all the things that worked at the European level. We can reconstruct also the journey of the Venetian maritime empire  how it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea  how it became the most powerful medieval empire of its time  controlling most of the sea routes from the east to the south. But you can even do other things  because in these maritime routes  there are regular patterns. You can go one step beyond and actually create a simulation system  create a Mediterranean simulator which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing  which would enable us to have  questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner.  If I am in Corfu in June      and want to go to Constantinople  where can I take a boat   Probably we can answer this question with one or two or three days' precision.  How much will it cost    What are the chance of encountering pirates   Of course  you understand  the central scientific challenge of a project like this one is qualifying  quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process. There are errors everywhere  errors in the document  it's the wrong name of the captain  some of the boats never actually took to sea. There are errors in translation  interpretative biases  and on top of that  if you add algorithmic processes  you're going to have errors in recognition  errors in extraction  so you have very  very uncertain data. So how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies  How can we represent that form of uncertainty  It's difficult. One thing you can do is document each step of the process  not only coding the historical information but what we call the meta historical information  how is historical knowledge constructed  documenting each step. That will not guarantee that we actually converge toward a single story of Venice  but probably we can actually reconstruct a fully documented potential story of Venice. Maybe there's not a single map. Maybe there are several maps. The system should allow for that  because we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty  which is really new for this type of giant databases. And how should we communicate this new research to a large audience  Again  Venice is extraordinary for that. With the millions of visitors that come every year  it's actually one of the best places to try to invent the museum of the future. Imagine  horizontally you see the reconstructed map of a given year  and vertically  you see the document that served the reconstruction  paintings  for instance. Imagine an immersive system that permits to go and dive and reconstruct the Venice of a given year  some experience you could share within a group. On the contrary  imagine actually that you start from a document  a Venetian manuscript  and you show  actually  what you can construct out of it  how it is decoded  how the context of that document can be recreated. This is an image from an exhibit which is currently conducted in Geneva with that type of system. So to conclude  we can say that research in the humanities is about to undergo an evolution which is maybe similar to what happened to life sciences    years ago. It's really a question of scale. We see projects which are much beyond any single research team can do  and this is really new for the humanities  which very often take the habit of working in small groups or only with a couple of researchers. When you visit the Archivio di Stato  you feel this is beyond what any single team can do  and that should be a joint and common effort. So what we must do for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new generation of  digital humanists  that are going to be ready for this shift. I thank you very much. For any of you who have visited or lived in New York City  these shots might start to look familiar. This is Central Park  one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in America. But to anyone who hasn't visited  these images can't really fully convey. To really understand Central Park  you have to physically be there. Well  the same is true of the music  which my brother and I composed and mapped specifically for Central Park. I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother Hays and I are doing    That's us there. That's both of us actually   specifically about a concept that we've been developing over the last few years  this idea of location aware music. Now  my brother and I  we're musicians and music producers. We've been working together since  well  since we were kids  really. But recently  we've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect  from creating sight specific audio and video installation to engineering interactive concerts. But today I want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space. But before I go too much further into that  let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea. My brother and I were living in New York City when the artists Christo and Jeanne Claude did their temporary installation  The Gates  in Central Park. Hundreds of these brightly colored sculptures decorated the park for a number of weeks  and unlike work that's exhibited in a more neutral space  like on the walls of a gallery or a museum  this was work that was really in dialogue with this place  and in a lot of ways  The Gates was really a celebration of Frederick Olmsted's incredible design. This was an experience that stayed with us for a long time  and years later  my brother and I moved back to Washington  D.C.  and we started to ask the question  would it be possible  in the same way that The Gates responded to the physical layout of the park  to compose music for a landscape  Which brought us to this. On Memorial Day  we released  The National Mall   a location aware album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device's built in GPS functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of Washington  D.C. Hundreds of musical segments are geo tagged throughout the entire park so that as a listener traverses the landscape  a musical score is actually unfolding around them. So this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended for the park  but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener's chosen trajectory. So think of this as a choose your own adventure of an album. Let's take a closer look. Let's look at one example here. So using the app  as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the Washington Monument  you hear the sounds of instruments warming up  which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody. This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins. Keep walking  and a full choir joins in  until you finally reach the top of the hill and you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks and all sorts of musical craziness  as if all of these sounds are radiating out from this giant obelisk that punctuates the center of the park. But were you to walk in the opposite direction  this entire sequence happens in reverse. And were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park  the music would fade to silence  and the play button would disappear. We're sometimes contacted by  people in other parts of the world who can't travel to the United States  but would like to hear this record. Well  unlike a normal album  we haven't been able to accommodate this request. When they ask for a C.D. or an MP  version  we just can't make that happen  and the reason is because this isn't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record. In this case  the app is the work itself  and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience. Six months later  we did a location aware album for Central Park  a park that is over two times the size of the National Mall  with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow to the Ramble to the Reservoir. Currently  my brother and I are working on projects all over the country  but last spring we started a project  here actually at Stanford's Experimental Media Art Department  where we're creating our largest location aware album to date  one that will span the entirety of Highway   here on the Pacific Coast. But what we're doing  integrating GPS with music  is really just one idea. But it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age  that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model  but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with and experience music. Thank you. The entire model of capitalism and the economic model that you and I did business in  and  in fact  continue to do business in  was built around what probably Milton Friedman put more succinctly. And Adam Smith  of course   the father of modern economics actually said many  many years ago  the invisible hand  which is   If you continue to operate in your own self interest you will do the best good for society.  Now  capitalism has done a lot of good things and I've talked about a lot of good  things that have happened  but equally  it has not been able to meet up with some of the challenges that we've seen in society. The model that at least I was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in was one which talked about what I call the three G's of growth  growth that is consistent  quarter on quarter  growth that is competitive  better than the other person  and growth that is profitable  so you continue to make more and more shareholder value. And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough and we have to move from this  G model to a model of what I call the fourth G  the G of growth that is responsible. And it is this that has to become a very important part of creating value. Of not just creating economic value but creating social value. And companies that will thrive are those that will actually embrace the fourth G. And the model of  G is quite simple  Companies cannot afford  to be just innocent bystanders in what's happening around in society. They have to begin to play their role in terms of serving the communities which actually sustain them. And we have to move to a model of an and and model which is how do we make money and do good  How do we make sure that we have a great business but we also have a great environment around us  And that model is all about doing well and doing good. But the question is easier said than done. But how do we actually get that done  And I do believe that the answer to that is going to be leadership. It is going to be to redefine the new business models which understand that the only license to operate is to combine these things. And for that you need businesses that can actually define their role in society in terms of a much larger purpose than the products and brands that they sell. And companies that actually define a true north  things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good  bad  ugly    doesn't matter. There are things that you stand for. Values and purpose are going to be the two drivers of software that are going to create the companies of tomorrow. And I'm going to now shift to talking a little bit about my own experiences. I joined Unilever in      as a management trainee in India. And on my first day of work I walked in and my boss tells me   Do you know why you're here   I said   I'm here to sell a lot of soap.  And he said    No  you're here to change lives.  You're here to change lives. You know  I thought it was rather facetious. We are a company that sells soap and soup. What are we doing about changing lives  And it's then I realized that simple acts like selling a bar of soap can save more lives than pharmaceutical companies. I don't know how many of you know that five million children don't reach the age of five because of simple infections that can be prevented by an act of washing their hands with soap. We run the largest hand washing program in the world. We are running a program on hygiene and health that now touches half a billion people. It's not about selling soap  there is a larger purpose out there. And brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change. And the reason for that is  when two billion people use your brands that's the amplifier. Small actions can make a big difference. Take another example  I was walking around in  one of our villages in India. Now those of you who have done this will realize that this is no walk in the park. And we had this lady who was one of our small distributors    beautiful  very  very modest  her home    and she was out there  dressed nicely  her husband in the back  her mother in law behind and her sister in law behind her. The social order was changing because this lady is part of our Project Shakti that is actually teaching women how to do small business and how to carry the message of nutrition and hygiene. We have        such women now in India. It's not about selling soap  it's about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people's lives. Small actions  big difference. Our R D folks are not only working to give us  some fantastic detergents  but they're working to make sure we use less water. A product that we've just launched recently  One Rinse product that allows you to save water every time you wash your clothes. And if we can convert all our users to using this  that's     billion liters of water. By the way  that's equivalent to one month of water for a whole huge continent. So just think about it. There are small actions that  can make a big difference. And I can go on and on. Our food chain  our brilliant products    and I'm sorry I'm giving you  a word from the sponsors    Knorr  Hellman's and all those wonderful products. We are committed to making sure that all our agricultural raw materials are sourced from sustainable sources      percent sustainable sources. We were the first to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil from sustainable sources. I don't know how many of you know that palm oil  and not buying it from sustainable sources  can create deforestation that is responsible for    percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world. We were the first to embrace that  and it's all because we market soap and soup. And the point I'm making here is that companies like yours  companies like mine have to define a purpose which embraces responsibility and understands that we have to play our part in the communities in which we operate. We introduced something called The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan  which said   Our purpose is to make  sustainable living commonplace  and we are gong to change the lives of one billion people over     .  Now the question here is  where do we go from here  And the answer to that is very simple  We're not going to change the world alone. There are plenty of you and plenty of us who understand this. The question is  we need partnerships  we need coalitions and importantly  we need that leadership that will allow us to take this from here and to be the change that we want to see around us. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here in Edinburgh  Scotland  the birthplace of the needle and syringe. Less than a mile from here in this direction  in      a Scotsman filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe. His name was Alexander Wood  and it was at the Royal College of Physicians. This is the patent. What blows my mind when I look at it even today is that it looks almost identical to the needle in use today. Yet  it's     years old. So we turn to the field of vaccines. Most vaccines are delivered with the needle and syringe   this     year old technology. And credit where it's due    on many levels  vaccines are a successful technology. After clean water and sanitation  vaccines are the one technology that has increased our life span the most. That's a pretty hard act to beat. But just like any other technology  vaccines have their shortcomings  and the needle and syringe is a key part within that narrative    this old technology. So let's start with the obvious  Many of us don't like the needle and syringe. I share that view. However     percent of the population have a thing called needle phobia. That's more than disliking the needle  that is actively avoiding being vaccinated because of needle phobia. And that's problematic in terms  of the rollout of vaccines. Now  related to this is another key issue  which is needlestick injuries. And the WHO has figures that suggest about  .  million deaths per year take place due to cross contamination with needlestick injuries. These are early deaths that take place. Now  these are two things that  you probably may have heard of  but there are two other shortcomings of the needle and syringe you  may not have heard about. One is it could be holding back the next generation of vaccines in terms of their immune responses. And the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that I'll tell you about as well. I'm going to tell you about some work that my team and I are doing in Australia at the University of Queensland on a technology designed to  tackle those four problems. And that technology is called the Nanopatch. Now  this is a specimen of the Nanopatch. To the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp  but under a microscope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye. And there's about       projections on this particular square compared to the needle. And I've designed those projections to serve a key role  which is to  work with the skin's immune system. So that's a very important function tied in with the Nanopatch. Now we make the Nanopatch with a technique called deep reactive ion etching. And this particular technique  is one that's been borrowed from the semiconductor industry  and therefore is low cost and can be rolled out in large numbers. Now we dry coat vaccines to  the projections of the Nanopatch and apply it to the skin. Now  the simplest form of application is using our finger  but our finger has some limitations  so we've devised an applicator. And it's a very simple device    you could call it a sophisticated finger. It's a spring operated device. What we do is when we apply  the Nanopatch to the skin as so    immediately a few things happen. So firstly  the projections on the Nanopatch breach through the tough outer layer and the vaccine is very quickly released    within less than a minute  in fact. Then we can take the Nanopatch off and discard it. And indeed we can make  a reuse of the applicator itself. So that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch  and immediately you can see some key advantages. We've talked about it being needle free    these are projections that you can't even see    and  of course  we get around the needle phobia issue as well. Now  if we take a step back and think about these other two really important advantages  One is improved immune  responses through delivery  and the second is getting rid of the cold chain. So let's start with the first one   this immunogenicity idea. It takes a little while to get our heads around  but I'll try to explain it in simple terms. So I'll take a step back and explain to you how vaccines work in a simple way. So vaccines work by introducing into our body a thing called an antigen which is a safe form of a germ. Now that safe germ  that antigen  tricks our body into mounting an immune response  learning and remembering  how to deal with intruders. When the real intruder comes along the body quickly mounts an immune response to deal with that vaccine and neutralizes the infection. So it does that well. Now  the way it's done today  with the needle and syringe  most vaccines are delivered that way    with this old technology and the needle. But it could be argued that the needle  is holding back our immune responses  it's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin. To describe this idea  we need to take a journey through the skin  starting with one of those projections and applying the Nanopatch to the skin. And we see this kind of data. Now  this is real data    that thing that we can see there is one projection from the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin and those colors are different layers. Now  to give you an idea of scale  if the needle was shown here  it would be too big. It would be    times bigger than the size of that screen  going    times deeper as well. It's off the grid entirely. You can see immediately that we  have those projections in the skin. That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin  but the brown layer and the magenta layer are jammed full of immune cells. As one example  in the brown layer there's a certain type of cell  called a Langerhans cell    every square millimeter of our body is jammed full of those Langerhans cells  those immune cells  and  there's others shown as well that we haven't stained in this image. But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch achieves that penetration indeed. We target thousands upon thousands  of these particular cells just residing within a hair's width of the surface of the skin. Now  as the guy that's invented this thing and designed it to do that  I found that exciting. But so what  So what if you've targeted cells  In the world of vaccines  what does that mean  The world of vaccines is getting better. It's getting more systematic. However  you still don't really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sleeves up and vaccinate and wait. It's a gambler's game even today. So  we had to do that gamble. We obtained an influenza vaccine  we applied it to our Nanopatches and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin  and we waited    and this is in the live animal. We waited a month  and this is what we found out. This is a data slide showing the immune responses that we've generated with a Nanopatch compared to the needle and syringe into muscle. So on the horizontal axis we have  the dose shown in nanograms. On the vertical axis we have  the immune response generated  and that dashed line indicates  the protection threshold. If we're above that line it's considered protective  if we're below that line it's not. So the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there's only one point that  is achieved with the needle that's protective  and that's with a high dose of       nanograms. But notice immediately the distinctly different curve that we achieve with the blue line. That's what's achieved with the Nanopatch  the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is a completely different immunogenicity curve. That's a real fresh opportunity. Suddenly we have a brand new lever in the world of vaccines. We can push it one way  where we can take a vaccine  that works but is too expensive and can get protection with a hundredth of the dose  compared to the needle. That can take a vaccine that's suddenly     dollars down to    cents  and that's particularly important  within the developing world. But there's another angle to this as well    you can take vaccines that currently don't work and get them over that line and get them protective. And certainly in the world of vaccines that can be important. Let's consider the big three  HIV  malaria  tuberculosis. They're responsible for about    million deaths per year  and there is no adequate vaccination  method for any of those. So potentially  with this new lever  that we have with the Nanopatch  we can help make that happen. We can push that lever to help get those  candidate vaccines over the line. Now  of course  we've worked within my lab with many other vaccines that have attained similar responses and similar curves to this  what we've achieved with influenza. I'd like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today's vaccines  and that is the need to maintain the cold chain. As the name suggests    the cold chain    it's the requirements of keeping  a vaccine right from production all the way through to when the vaccine is applied  to keep it refrigerated. Now  that presents some logistical challenges but we have ways to do it. This is a slightly extreme case in point but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges  in particular in resource poor settings  of what's required to get vaccines refrigerated and maintain the cold chain. If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down  but interestingly it can be too cold and the vaccine can break down as well. Now  the stakes are very high. The WHO estimates that within Africa  up to half the vaccines used there are considered to not be working properly because at some point the  cold chain has fallen over. So it's a big problem  and it's tied  in with the needle and syringe because it's a liquid form vaccine  and  when it's liquid it needs the refrigeration. A key attribute of our Nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry  and when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration. Within my lab we've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at    degrees Celsius for more than a year without  any loss in activity at all. That's an important improvement. We're delighted about it as well. And the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting. And as a scientist  I love that and I love science. However  as an engineer  as a biomedical engineer and also as a human being  I'm not going to be satisfied until we've rolled this thing  out  taken it out of the lab and got it to people in large numbers and particularly the people that need it the most. So we've commenced this particular journey  and we've commenced this  journey in an unusual way. We've started with Papua New Guinea. Now  Papua New Guinea is an example  of a developing world country. It's about the same size as France  but it suffers from many of the key barriers existing within the world of today's vaccines. There's the logistics  Within this country there are only      refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled. Many of them are old  like this one in Port Moresby  many of them are breaking down and many are not in the Highlands  where they are required. That's a challenge. But also  Papua New Guinea has the  world's highest incidence of HPV  human papillomavirus  the  cervical cancer  risk factor . Yet  that vaccine is not available in large numbers because it's too expensive. So for those two reasons  with  the attributes of the Nanopatch  we've got into the field and  worked with the Nanopatch  and taken it to Papua New Guinea and we'll be following that up shortly. Now  doing this kind of work is not easy. It's challenging  but there's nothing else in  the world I'd rather be doing. And as we look ahead I'd like to share with you a thought  It's the thought of a future where the    million deaths per year that we currently have due to infectious disease is a historical footnote. And it's a historical footnote that has been achieved by improved  radically improved vaccines. Now standing here today in front of you at the birthplace of the needle and syringe  a device that's     years old  I'm presenting to you an alternative approach that could really help make that happen    and it's the Nanopatch with its attributes  of being needle free  pain free  the ability for removing the cold chain and improving the immunogenicity. Thank you. Pat Mitchell  Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage. Sheryl Sandberg  First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out and see so many women. It's so not my regular experience   as I know anyone else's. PM  So when we first started talking about  maybe the subject wouldn't be social media  which we assumed it would be  but  that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership positions  particularly  in the sector of technology and social media. But how did that evolve for you as a thought  and end up being the TED Talk that you gave  SS  So I was really scared to get on  this stage and talk about women  because I grew up in the business  world  as I think so many of us did. You never talk about being a woman  because  someone might notice that you're a woman  right  They might notice. Or worse  if you say  woman    people on the other end of the table think you're asking for special  treatment  or complaining. Or worse  about to sue them.  And so I went through     Laughter  Right  I went through my entire business career  and never spoke about being a woman   never spoke about it publicly. But I also had noticed that it wasn't working. I came out of college over     years ago  and I thought that all of my peers were men and women   all the people above me were all men  but that would change  because your generation had done such  an amazing job fighting for equality  equality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't. Because year after year  I was one of fewer and fewer  and now  often the only woman in a room. And I talked to a bunch of people about  should I give a speech at TEDWomen  about women  and they said  oh no  no. It will end your business career. You  cannot be a serious business executive and speak about being a woman.  You'll never be taken seriously again. But fortunately  there were the few  the proud    like you    who told me I should give the speech  and I asked myself the question  Mark Zuckerberg might    the founder of Facebook and my boss    asks all of us  which is  what  would I do if I wasn't afraid  And the answer to what would I do if I wasn't  afraid is I would get on the TED stage  and talk about women  and leadership.  And I did  and survived.  Applause  PM  I would say  not only survived.  I'm thinking of that moment  Sheryl  when you and I were standing backstage  together  and you turned to me  and you told me a story. And I said    very last minute    you know   you really should share that story. SS  Oh  yeah. PM  What was that story  SS  Well  it's an important part of the  journey. So I had    TEDWomen    the original one was in D.C.    so I live here   so I had gotten on a plane the day before  and my daughter was three  she was  clinging to my leg   Mommy  don't go.  And Pat's a friend  and so  not related  to the speech I was planning on giving  which was chock full of facts and  figures  and nothing personal  I told Pat the story. I said  well   I'm having a hard day. Yesterday my daughter was clinging  to my leg  and  Don't go.  And you looked at me and said   you have to tell that story. I said  on the TED stage  Are you kidding  I'm going to get on a stage and admit  my daughter was clinging to my leg  And you said yes  because if you want to talk  about getting more women into leadership roles  you have to be honest about how hard it is. And I did. And I think that's a really  important part of the journey. The same thing happened when I wrote my book.  I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter  I thought it was fabulous. It was  chock full of data and figures  I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai  tribes  and their sociological patterns. My husband read it and he was like  this  is like eating your Wheaties.  Laughter  No one    and I apologize to Wheaties if there's  someone    no one  no one will read this book. And I realized through the process that I  had to be more honest and more open  and I had to tell my stories. My stories of still  not feeling as self confident as I should  in many situations. My first and  failed marriage. Crying at work. Felling like I didn't belong there   feeling guilty to this day. And part of my journey  starting on this stage   going to  Lean In   going to the foundation  is all about being more open and  honest about those challenges  so that other women can be more open and honest  and all of us can work together towards real equality. PM  I think that one of the most  striking parts about the book  and in my opinion  one of the reasons it's hit such  a nerve and is resonating around the world  is that you are personal in the book   and that you do make it clear that  while you've observed some things that are  very important for other women to know  that you've had the same challenges  that many others of us have  as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and  possibly the people who don't believe the same. So talk about that process  deciding  you'd go public with the private part  and then you would also put yourself in  the position of something of an expert on how to resolve those challenges. SS  After I did the TED Talk  what happened was    you know  I never really expected to write  a book  I'm not an author  I'm not a writer  and it was viewed a lot  and it really  started impacting people's lives. I got this great     one of the first  letters I got was from a woman who said that she was offered a really big  promotion at work  and she turned it down  and she told her best friend she turned  it down  and her best friend said  you really need to watch this TED Talk. And so she watched this TED Talk  and she  went back the next day  she took the job  she went home  and she handed her  husband the grocery list.  Laughter  And she said  I can do this. And what really mattered to me    it wasn't  only women in the corporate world  even though I did hear from a lot of  them  and it did impact a lot of them  it was also people of all different circumstances. There was a doctor I met who was an  attending physician at Johns Hopkins  and he said that until he saw my TED  Talk  it never really occurred to him that even though half the students in  his med school classes were women  they weren't speaking as much as  the men as he did his rounds. So he started paying attention  and as he waited for  raised hands  he realized the men's hands were up. So he started encouraging the  women to raise their hands more  and it still didn't work. So he told everyone  no more  hand raising  I'm cold calling. So he could call evenly on men and women.  And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better  and he was able to go back  to them and tell them that. And then there was the woman  stay at home  mom  lives in a really difficult neighborhood  with not a great school  she said that TED  Talk    she's never had a corporate job  but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school  and fight for a better teacher for her child. And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice. And I realized that other women and  men could find their voice through it  which is why I went from the talk to the book. PM  And in the book  you not only found your  voice  which is clear and strong in the book  but you also share what you've learned    the experiences of other people in the lessons. And that's what I'm thinking about  in terms of putting yourself in a    you became a sort of expert in how you lean in. So what did that feel like  and  become like in your life  To launch not just a book  not just  a best selling  best viewed talk  but a movement  where people began to  literally describe their actions at work as  I'm leaning in. SS  I mean  I'm grateful  I'm honored   I'm happy  and it's the very beginning. So I don't know if I'm an expert  or if anyone is  an expert. I certainly have done a lot of research. I have read every study  I have  pored over the materials  and the lessons are very clear.  Because here's what we know  What we know is that stereotypes are holding women  back from leadership roles all over the world. It's so striking.  Lean In  is very global   I've been all over the world  talking about it  and    cultures are so different. Even within our own country  to Japan   to Korea  to China  to Asia  Europe  they're so different. Except for one thing  gender. All over the world  no matter what our cultures are  we think men should be strong   assertive  aggressive  have voice  we think women should speak  when spoken to  help others. Now we have  all over the world  women are called  bossy.   There is a word for  bossy   for little girls  in every language there's one. It's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys  because if a little boy leads   there's no negative word for it  it's expected. But if a little girl leads  she's bossy. Now I know there aren't a lot of  men here  but bear with me. If you're a man  you'll have  to represent your gender. Please raise your hand if you've been  told you're too aggressive at work. If you're a woman  please raise your hand if you've  ever been told you're too aggressive at work. and it's deeply supported by the data. Now  do we think women are more  aggressive than men  Of course not. It's just that we judge them through a different lens  and a lot of the character traits that you must  exhibit to perform at work  to get results  to lead  are ones that we think  in a man  he's a boss  and in a woman  she's bossy. And the good news about this is that we  can change this by acknowledging it. One of the happiest moments  I had in this whole journey is  after the book came out  I stood on a stage  with John Chambers  the CEO of Cisco. He read the book. He stood on a stage with me  he  invited me in front of his whole management team  men and women  and he said  I thought we  were good at this. I thought I was good at this. And then I read this book  and I  realized that we    my company    we have called all of our  senior women too aggressive  and I'm standing on this stage  and I'm sorry. And I want you to know we're  never going to do it again. PM  Can we send that to a lot of other  people that we know   Applause  SS  And so John is doing that because  he believes it's good for his company  and so this kind of acknowledgement  of these biases can change it. And so next time you all see  someone call a little girl  bossy   you walk right up to that person   big smile  and you say   That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has  executive leadership skills.   Laughter  PM  I know that's what you're telling your daughter.  SS  Absolutely. PM  And you did focus in the book    and  the reason  as you said  in writing it  was to create a dialogue about this. I mean  let's just put it out there   face the fact that women are    in a time when we have more open  doors  and more opportunities    are still not getting to the leadership positions. So in the months that have come since the book  in which  Lean In  focused on that and said  here are some of the challenges that remain  and  many of them we have to own within ourselves and look at ourselves. What has changed  Have you seen changes  SS  Well  there's certainly more  dialogue  which is great. But what really matters to me   and I think all of us  is action. So everywhere I go  CEOs   they're mostly men  say to me  you're costing me so much money because all the women want to  be paid as much as the men. And to them I say  I'm not sorry at all.  Laughter  At all. I mean  the women should  be paid as much as the men. Everywhere I go  women tell me they ask for raises. Everywhere I go  women say they're getting  better relationships with their spouses  asking for more help at home  asking for the  promotions they should be getting at work  and importantly  believing it  themselves. Even little things. One of the governors of one of the states told me  that he didn't realize that more women were  in fact  literally sitting on the side  of the room  which they are  and now he made a rule that all the women  on his staff need to sit at the table. The foundation I started along  with the book  Lean In  helps women  or men  start circles    small groups  it can be     it can be however many  you want  which meet once a month. I would have hoped that by now  we'd have  about     circles. That would've been great. You know      times roughly   . There are over        circles  in    countries in the world. PM  Wow  that's amazing. SS  And these are people who  are meeting every single month. I met one of them  I was in Beijing. A group of women  they're all about    or      they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing  several of them grew up in very poor  rural China. These women are     they are told by  their society that they are  left over   because they are not yet married  and the process of coming together  once a month at a meeting is helping them define who they are for themselves. What they want in their careers. The  kind of partners they want  if at all. I looked at them  we went around  and introduced ourselves  and they all said their names  and where they're from  and I said  I'm Sheryl Sandberg   and this was my dream. And I kind of just started crying. Right  which  I admit  I do. Right   I've talked about it before. But the fact that a woman so far away out in  the world  who grew up in a rural village  who's being told to marry someone  she doesn't want to marry  can now go meet once a month with  a group of people and refuse that  and find life on her own terms. That's the kind of change we have to hope for. PM  Have you been surprised by  the global nature of the message  Because I think when the book first  came out  many people thought  well  this is a really important handbook  for young women on their way up. They need to look at this  anticipate  the barriers  and recognize them  put them out in the open  have the dialogue about it  but that it's really for women who are that.  Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world. And yet the book is being read  as you  say  in rural and developing countries. What part of that has surprised you  and  perhaps led to a new perspective on your part  SS  The book is about self confidence   and about equality. And it turns out  everywhere in the world   women need more self confidence  because the world tells us we're not equal to men. Everywhere in the world  we live in  a world where the men get  and   and women get  or.  I've never met a man who's been  asked how he does it all.  Laughter  Again  I'm going to turn to the men in the audience  Please raise your hand if you've  been asked  how do you do it all  Men only. Women  women. Please raise your hand  if you've been asked how you do it all  We assume men can do it all   slash    have jobs and children. We assume women can't  and that's ridiculous  because the great majority of women everywhere  in the world  including the United States  work full time and have children. And I think people don't fully understand  how broad the message is. There is a circle that's been started  for rescued sex workers in Miami. They're using  Lean In  to help  people make the transition back to what would be a fair life  really rescuing  them from their pimps  and using it. There are dress for success groups  in Texas which are using the book  for women who have never been to college. And we know there are groups  all the way to Ethiopia. And so these messages of equality    of how women  are told they can't have what men can have    how we assume that leadership is for men   how we assume that voice is for men  these affect all of us  and I  think they are very universal. And it's part of what TEDWomen does. It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in  which is more women  more voice  more equality. PM  If you were invited now to  make another TEDWomen talk  what would you say that is a result  of this experience  for you personally  and what you've learned about women  and men  as you've made this journey  SS  I think I would say    I tried to say this strongly  but I think I can say it more strongly    I want to say that the status quo is not enough. That it's not good enough  that it's  not changing quickly enough. Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book   another year of data came out from the U.S. Census. And you know what we found  No movement in the wage gap  for women in the United States. Seventy seven cents to the dollar. If you are a black woman     cents. If you are a Latina  we're at    cents. Do you know when the last  time those numbers went up      . We are stagnating  we are  stagnating in so many ways. And I think we are not really being honest about that  for so many reasons. It's so  hard to talk about gender. We shy away from the word  feminist    a word I really think we need to embrace. We have to get rid of the  word bossy and bring back    I think I would say in a louder voice   we need to get rid of the word  bossy  and bring back the word  feminist    because we need it. PM  And we all need to do a lot more leaning in. SS  A lot more leaning in. PM  Thank you  Sheryl. Thanks for leaning in and saying yes. SS  Thank you. Two years ago  I have to say there was no problem. Two years ago  I knew exactly  what an icon looked like. It looks like this. Everybody's icon  but also the default position of a curator of Italian Renaissance  paintings  which I was then. And in a way  this is also another default selection. Leonardo da Vinci's exquisitely soulful image of the  Lady with an Ermine.  And I use that word  soulful  deliberately. Or then there's this  or rather these  the two versions of Leonardo's  Virgin of the Rocks  that were about to come together  in London for the very first time. In the exhibition that I was then in  the absolute throes of organizing. I was literally up to my eyes in Leonardo  and I had been for three years. So  he was occupying every part of my brain. Leonardo had taught me  during that three years  about what a picture can do. About taking you from your own  material world into a spiritual world. He said  actually  that he believed  the job of the painter was to paint everything that was visible  and invisible in the universe. That's a huge task. And yet   somehow he achieves it. He shows us  I think  the human soul. He shows us the capacity of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm. To see a vision of the universe that's  more perfect than our own. To see God's own plan  in some sense. So this  in a sense  was really  what I believed an icon was. At about that time  I started talking to Tom Campbell  director here of the Metropolitan Museum  about what my next move might be. The move  in fact  back to an earlier life  one I'd begun at the British Museum  back to the world of three dimensions    of sculpture and of decorative arts    to take over the department of European sculpture  and decorative arts  here at the Met. But it was an incredibly busy time. All the conversations were done  at very peculiar times of the day    over the phone. In the end  I accepted the job without actually having been here. Again  I'd been there a couple of years before  but on that particular visit. So  it was just before the time that  the Leonardo show was due to open when I finally made it back to the Met  to New York  to see my new domain. To see what European sculpture  and decorative arts looked like  beyond those Renaissance collections  with which I was so already familiar. And I thought  on that very first day   I better tour the galleries. Fifty seven of these galleries    like    varieties of baked beans  I believe. I walked through and I started in my comfort zone in the Italian Renaissance. And then I moved gradually around  feeling a little lost sometimes. My head  also still full of the Leonardo exhibition that was about to open  and I came across this. And I thought to myself  What the hell have I done  There was absolutely no connection in my mind at all and  in fact  if there was any emotion going on  it was a kind of repulsion. This object felt utterly and completely alien. Silly at a level that I hadn't yet  understood silliness to be. And then it was made worse    there were two of them. So  I started thinking about why it was  in fact  that I disliked this object so much. What was the anatomy of my distaste  Well  so much gold  so vulgar. You know  so nouveau riche  frankly. Leonardo himself had preached  against the use of gold  so it was absolutely anathema at that moment. And then there's little pretty sprigs  of flowers everywhere.  Laughter  And finally  that pink. That damned pink. It's such an extraordinarily artificial color. I mean  it's a color that I can't think of  anything that you actually see in nature  that looks that shade. The object even has its own tutu.  Laughter  This little flouncy  spangly  bottomy bit that sits at the bottom of the vase. It reminded me  in an odd kind of way  of my niece's fifth birthday party. Where all the little girls would come  either as a princess or a fairy. There was one who would come as a fairy princess. You should have seen the looks. And I realize that this object was in my mind  born from the same mind  from the same womb  practically  as Barbie Ballerina.  Laughter  And then there's the elephants.  Laughter  Those extraordinary elephants with their little  sort of strange  sinister expressions and Greta Garbo eyelashes  with  these golden tusks and so on. I realized this was an elephant that had absolutely nothing to do with a majestic  march across the Serengeti. It was a Dumbo nightmare.  Laughter  But something more profound  was happening as well. These objects  it seemed to me  were quintessentially the kind that I  and my liberal left friends in London had always seen as summing up something deplorable about the French aristocracy in the   th century. The label had told me that these pieces were made by the S vres Manufactory  made of porcelain in the late     s  and designed by a designer called  Jean Claude Duplessis  actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as I later learned. But for me  they summed up a kind of  that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy in the   th century. I and my colleagues had always thought that these objects  in way  summed up the idea of  you know    no wonder there was a revolution. Or  indeed  thank God there was a revolution. There was a sort of idea really  that  if you owned a vase like this  then there was really only one fate possible. So  there I was    in a sort of paroxysm of horror. But I took the job and I went  on looking at these vases. I sort of had to because they're  on a through route in the Met. So  almost anywhere I went  there they were. They had this kind of odd sort of fascination  like a car accident. Where I couldn't stop looking. And as I did so  I started thinking  Well  what are we actually looking at here  And what I started with was understanding this as really a supreme piece of design. It took me a little time. But  that tutu for example    actually  this is a piece that  does dance in its own way. It has an extraordinary lightness and yet  it is also amazing balanced. It has these kinds of sculptural ingredients. And then the play between    actually really quite carefully disposed  color and gilding  and the sculptural surface  is really rather remarkable. And then I realized that this piece went into the kiln four times  at least four times  in order to arrive at this. How many moments for accident can you think of that could have happened to this piece  And then remember  not just one  but two. So he's having to arrive at two exactly matched vases of this kind. And then this question of uselessness. Well actually  the end of the trunks  were originally candle holders. So what you would have had  were candles on either side. Imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface. On the slightly uneven pink  on the beautiful gold. It would have glittered in an interior  a little like a little firework. And at that point  actually   a firework went off in my brain. Somebody reminded me that  that word 'fancy'    which in a sense for me  encapsulated this object    actually comes from the same  root as the word 'fantasy.' And that what this object was just as much in a way  in its own way  as a Leonardo da Vinci painting  is a portal to somewhere else. This is an object of the imagination. If you think about the mad   th century  operas of the time    set in the Orient. If you think about divans and perhaps even  opium induced visions of pink elephants  then at that point  this object starts to make sense. This is an object which is all about escapism. It's about an escapism that happens    that the aristocracy in France sought very deliberately to distinguish themselves from ordinary people. It's not an escapism that we feel particularly happy with today  however. And again  going on thinking about this  I realize that in a way we're all victims of a certain kind of tyranny of the triumph of modernism whereby form and function in an object have to follow one another  or are deemed to do so. And the extraneous ornament is seen as really  essentially  criminal. It's a triumph  in a way  of bourgeois values rather than aristocratic ones. And that seems fine. Except for the fact that it becomes a kind of  sequestration of imagination. So just as in the   th century  so many people had the idea that their faith took place on the Sabbath day  and the rest of their lives    their lives of washing machines and orthodontics    took place on another day. Then  I think we've started doing the same. We've allowed ourselves to lead our fantasy lives in front of screens. In the dark of the cinema  with the television in the corner of the room. We've eliminated  in a sense  that constant of the imagination that these vases  represented in people's lives. So maybe it's time we got this back a little. I think it's beginning to happen. In London  for example  with these extraordinary buildings that have been appearing over the last few years. Redolent  in a sense  of science fiction  turning London into a kind of fantasy playground. It's actually amazing to look out of  a high building nowadays there. But even then  there's a resistance. London has called these buildings the  Gherkin  the Shard  the Walkie Talkie    bringing these soaring buildings down to Earth. There's an idea that we don't want these anxious making  imaginative journeys  to happen in our daily lives. I feel lucky in a way  I've encountered this object. I found him on the Internet when  I was looking up a reference. And there he was. And unlike the pink elephant vase  this was a kind of love at first sight. In fact  reader  I married him. I bought him. And he now adorns my office. He's a Staffordshire figure made  in the middle of the   th century. He represents the actor  Edmund Kean   playing Shakespeare's Richard III. And it's based  actually  on a more  elevated piece of porcelain. So I loved  on an art historical level  I loved that layered quality that he has. But more than that  I love him. In a way that I think would have been impossible without the pink S vres vase in my Leonardo days. I love his orange and pink breeches. I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war  having just finished the washing up.  Laughter  He seems also to have forgotten his sword. I love his pink little cheeks  his munchkin energy. In a way  he's become my sort of alter ego. He's  I hope  a little bit dignified  but mostly rather vulgar.  Laughter  And energetic  I hope  too. I let him into my life because the S vres pink elephant vase allowed me to do so. And before that Leonardo  I understood that this object could become  part of a journey for me every day  sitting in my office. I really hope that others  all of you  visiting objects in the museum  and taking them home and  finding them for yourselves  will allow those objects to flourish  in your imaginative lives. Thank you very much. My job is to design  build and study robots that communicate with people. But this story doesn't start with robotics at all  it starts with animation. When I first saw Pixar's  Luxo Jr.   I was amazed by how much emotion they could put into something as trivial as a desk lamp. I mean  look at them    at the end of this movie  you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture. And I said  I have to learn how to do this. So I made a really bad career decision. And that's what my mom was like when I did it. I left a very cozy tech job in Israel at a nice software company and I moved to New York to study animation. And there I lived in a collapsing apartment building in Harlem with roommates. I'm not using this phrase metaphorically    the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room. Whenever they did news stories about building violations in New York  they would put the report in front of our building  as kind of  like  a backdrop to show how bad things are. Anyway  during the day  I went to school and at night I would sit and draw frame by frame of pencil animation. And I learned two surprising lessons. One of them was that when you want to arouse emotions  it doesn't matter so much how something looks  it's all in the motion  in the timing of how the thing moves. And the second was something one of our teachers told us. He actually did the weasel in  Ice Age.  And he said   As an animator  you're not a director    you're an actor.  So  if you want to find the right motion for a character  don't think about it    go use your body to find it. Stand in front of a mirror  act it out in front of a camera    whatever you need    and then put it back in your character. A year later I found myself at MIT in the Robotic Life Group. It was one of the first groups researching the relationships between humans and robots. And I still had this dream to make an actual  physical Luxo Jr. lamp. But I found that robots didn't move at all in this engaging way that I was used to from my animation studies. Instead  they were all    how should I put it    they were all kind of robotic. And I thought  what if I took whatever I learned in animation school  and used that to design my robotic desk lamp. So I went and designed frame by frame to try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible. And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop    and I'm actually redesigning the robot  so  unbeknownst to itself  it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me. I wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light  and more of a helpful  kind of quiet apprentice that's always there when you need it and doesn't really interfere. And when  for example  I'm looking for a battery that I can't find  in a subtle way  it'll show me where the battery is. So you can see my confusion here. I'm not an actor. And I want you to notice how the same mechanical structure can  at one point  just by the way it moves  seem gentle and caring and in the other case  seem violent and confrontational. And it's the same structure  just the motion is different. Actor   You want to know something  Well  you want to know something  He was already dead  Just laying there  eyes glazed over   But  moving in a graceful way is just one building block of this whole structure called human robot interaction. I was  at the time  doing my PhD  I was working on human robot teamwork  teams of humans and robots working together. I was studying the engineering  the psychology  the philosophy of teamwork  and at the same time  I found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation  with a good friend of mine  who's actually here. And in that situation  we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us. It was after a Passover Seder. We were folding up a lot of folding chairs  and I was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm. Everybody did their own part  we didn't have to divide our tasks. We didn't have to communicate verbally about this    it all just happened. And I thought  humans and robots don't look at all like this. When humans and robots interact  it's much more like a chess game  the human does a thing  the robot analyzes whatever the human did  the robot decides what to do next  plans it and does it. Then the human waits  until it's their turn again. So it's much more like a chess game  and that makes sense  because chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists. It's all about information  analysis  decision making and planning. But I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player  and more like a doer that just clicks and works together. So I made my second horrible career choice  I decided to study acting for a semester. I took off from the PhD  I went to acting classes. I actually participated in a play    I hope there s no video of that around still. And I got every book I could find about acting  including one from the   th century that I got from the library. And I was really amazed  because my name was the second name on the list    the previous name was in     . And this book was kind of waiting for     years to be rediscovered for robotics. And this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion that they want to express. But the real revelation was when I learned about method acting. It became very popular in the   th century. And method acting said you don't have to plan every muscle in your body  instead  you have to use your body to find the right movement. You have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body to find the right expression    improvise  play off your scene partner. And this came at the same time as I was reading about this trend in cognitive psychology  called embodied cognition  which also talks about the same ideas. We use our bodies to think  we don't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move  but our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave. And it was like a lightning bolt. I went back to my office  I wrote this paper  which I never really published  called  Acting Lessons for Artificial Intelligence.  And I even took another month to do what was then the first theater play with a human and a robot acting together. That's what you saw before with the actors. And I thought  How can we make an artificial intelligence model    a computer  computational model    that will model some of these ideas of improvisation  of taking risks  of taking chances  even of making mistakes  Maybe it can make for better robotic teammates. So I worked for quite a long time on these models and I implemented them on a number of robots. Here you can see a very early example with the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence to try to match my movements as closely as possible. It's sort of like a game. Let's look at it. You can see when I psych it out  it gets fooled. And it's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them. And then  I did another experiment  and I got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp  and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence. So  I actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot. The robot is the same lamp that you saw  and I put two brains in it. For one half of the people  I put in a brain that's kind of the traditional  calculated robotic brain. It waits for its turn  it analyzes everything  it plans. Let's call it the calculated brain. The other got more the stage actor  risk taker brain. Let's call it the adventurous brain. It sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know. It sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them. And I had them do this very tedious task that took almost    minutes  and they had to work together  somehow simulating  like  a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing. What I found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot. They thought it was more intelligent  more committed  a better member of the team  contributed to the success of the team more. They even called it  he  and  she   whereas people with the calculated brain called it  it   and nobody ever called it  he  or  she.  When they talked about it after the task  with the adventurous brain  they said   By the end  we were good friends and high fived mentally.  Whatever that means. Sounds painful. Whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy apprentice. It only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more  which is almost what people expect robots to do  so I was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing. And in a way  I thought  maybe it's time    just like method acting changed the way people thought about acting in the   th century  from going from the very calculated  planned way of behaving  to a more intuitive  risk taking  embodied way of behaving    maybe it's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution. A few years later  I was at my next research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta  and I was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians. And I thought  music  that's the perfect place to look at teamwork  coordination  timing  improvisation    and we just got this robot playing marimba. And the marimba  for everybody like me  it was this huge  wooden xylophone. And when I was looking at this  I looked at other works in human robot improvisation    yes  there are other works in human robot improvisation    and they were also a little bit like a chess game. The human would play  the robot analyzed what was played  and would improvise their own part. So  this is what musicians called a call and response interaction  and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence. But I thought  if I use the same ideas I used in the theater play and in the teamwork studies  maybe I can make the robots jam together like a band. Everybody's riffing off each other  nobody is stopping for a moment. And so I tried to do the same things  this time with music  where the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play  it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play  and does what my jazz teacher when I was    taught me. She said  when you improvise  sometimes you don't know what you're doing  and you still do it. So I tried to make a robot that doesn't actually know what it's doing  but is still doing it. So let's look at a few seconds from this performance  where the robot listens to the human musician and improvises. And then  look how the human musician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its behavior  and at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with. Being a musician is not just about making notes  otherwise nobody would ever go see a live show. Musicians also communicate with their bodies  with other band members  with the audience  they use their bodies to express the music. And I thought  we already have a robot musician on stage  why not make it be a full fledged musician  And I started designing a socially expressive head for the robot. The head doesn t actually touch the marimba  it just expresses what the music is like. These are some napkin sketches from a bar in Atlanta that was dangerously located exactly halfway between my lab and my home. So I spent  I would say  on average  three to four hours a day there. I think. And I went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like  but especially what a robotic musician would move like  to sort of show that it doesn't like what the other person is playing    and maybe show whatever beat it's feeling at the moment. So we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot  which was nice. I'm going to show you now the same kind of performance  this time with a socially expressive head. And notice one thing    how the robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human  while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing. And also how it changes the way it moves as soon as it starts its own solo. Now it's looking at me  showing that it's listening. Now look at the final chord of the piece again. And this time the robot communicates with its body when it's busy doing its own thing  and when it's ready to coordinate the final chord with me. Thanks. I hope you see how much this part of the body that doesn't touch the instrument actually helps with the musical performance. And at some point    we are in Atlanta  so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point    and we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the robot. Here you can see the robot basically responding to the beat. Notice two things  one  how irresistible it is to join the robot while it's moving its head. You kind of want to move your own head when it does it. And second  even though the rapper is really focused on his iPhone  as soon as the robot turns to him  he turns back. So even though it's just in the periphery of his vision  in the corner of his eye  it's very powerful. And the reason is that we can't ignore physical things moving in our environment. We are wired for that. So if you have a problem    maybe your partner is looking at their iPhone or smartphone too much    you might want to have a robot there to get their attention. Just to introduce the last robot that we've worked on  it came out of something surprising that we found  Some point people didn't care about the robot being intelligent  able to improvise and listen  and do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years developing. They really liked that the robot was enjoying the music. And they didn't say the robot was moving to the music  they said  enjoying  the music. And we thought  why don't we take this idea  and I designed a new piece of furniture. This time it wasn't a desk lamp  it was a speaker dock  one of those things you plug your smartphone in. And I thought  what would happen if your speaker dock didn't just play the music for you  but would actually enjoy it  too  And so again  here are some animation tests from an early stage. And this is what the final product looked like. So  a lot of bobbing heads. A lot of bobbing heads in the audience  so we can still see robots influence people. And it's not just fun and games. I think one of the reasons I care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body to move is    I'm going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding    is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in your life. Somewhere in your future  there will be a robot in your life. If not in yours  your children's lives. And I want these robots to be more fluent  more engaging  more graceful than currently they seem to be. And for that I think maybe robots need to be less like chess players and more like stage actors and more like musicians. Maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise. Maybe they should be able to anticipate what you're about to do. Maybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them  because in the end  we are human. And maybe as humans  robots that are a little less than perfect are just perfect for us. Thank you. So when I was in Morocco  in Casablanca  not so long ago  I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza. Faiza showed me photos of her infant son and she told me the story of his conception  pregnancy  and delivery. It was a remarkable tale  but Faiza saved the best for last.  You know  I am a virgin   she told me.  I have two medical certificates to prove it.  This is the modern Middle East  where two millennia after the coming of Christ  virgin births are still a fact of life. Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard  over the years  traveling across the Arab region talking to people about sex. Now  I know this might sound like a dream job  or possibly a highly dubious occupation  but for me  it's something else altogether. I'm half Egyptian  and I'm Muslim. But I grew up in Canada  far from my Arab roots. Like so many who straddle East and West  I've been drawn  over the years  to try to better understand my origins. That I chose to look at sex comes from  my background in HIV AIDS  as a writer and a researcher and an activist. Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the Middle East and North Africa  which is one of only two regions in the world where HIV AIDS is still on the rise. Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society  because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage  in politics and economics  in religion and tradition   in gender and generations. As I found  if you really want to know a people  you start by looking inside their bedrooms. Now to be sure  the Arab world is vast and varied. But running across it are three red lines    these are topics you are not supposed  to challenge in word or deed. The first of these is politics. But the Arab Spring has changed all that  in uprisings which have blossomed  across the region since     . Now while those in power  old and new  continue to cling to business as usual  millions are still pushing back  and pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life. That second red line is religion. But now religion and politics are connected  with the rise of such groups as the  Muslim Brotherhood. And some people  at least  are starting  to ask questions about the role of Islam in public and private life. You know  as for that third red line   that off limits subject  what do you think it might be  Audience  Sex. Shereen El Feki  Louder  I can't hear you. Audience  Sex. SEF  Again  please don't be shy. Audience  Sex. SEF  Absolutely  that's right  it's sex.  Laughter  Across the Arab region  the only accepted context for sex is marriage    approved by your parents  sanctioned by religion and registered by the state. Marriage is your ticket to adulthood. If you don't tie the knot  you can't  move out of your parents' place  and you're not supposed to be having sex  and you're definitely not supposed  to be having children. It's a social citadel  it's an impregnable fortress which resists any assault  any alternative. And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex  against condoms  against abortion  against homosexuality  you name it. Faiza was living proof of this. Her virginity statement was  not a piece of wishful thinking. Although the major religions of the region extoll premarital chastity  in a patriarchy  boys will be boys. Men have sex before marriage  and people more or less turn a blind eye. Not so for women  who are expected to be virgins  on their wedding night    that is  to turn up with your hymen intact. This is not a question of individual concern  this is a matter of family honor   and in particular  men's honor. And so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve  this tiny piece of anatomy    from female genital mutilation  to virginity testing  to hymen repair surgery. Faiza chose a different route  non vaginal sex. Only she became pregnant all the same. But Faiza didn't actually realize this  because there's so little  sexuality education in schools  and so little communication in the family. When her condition became hard to hide  Faiza's mother helped her flee  her father and brothers. This is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the Arab region. And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at  a hospital in Casablanca  the man who offered to help her  instead tried to rape her. Sadly  Faiza is not alone. In Egypt  where my research is focused  I have seen plenty of trouble  in and out of the citadel. There are legions of young men who can't afford to get married  because marriage has become  a very expensive proposition. They are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life  but they can't find jobs. This is one of the major drivers  of the recent uprisings  and it is one of the reasons for the  rising age of marriage in much of the Arab region. There are career women who want to get married  but can't find a husband  because they defy gender expectations  or as one young female doctor  in Tunisia put it to me   The women  they are becoming more and more open. But the man  he is still at the prehistoric stage.  And then there are men and women who  cross the heterosexual line  who have sex with their own sex  or who have a different gender identity. They are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities  even their appearance. And they face a daily struggle with social stigma  with family despair  and with religious fire and brimstone. Now  it's not as if it's all rosy  in the marital bed either. Couples who are looking for greater happiness  greater sexual happiness in their married lives  but are at a loss of how to achieve it  especially wives  who are afraid  of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom. And then there are those whose marriages are actually a veil for prostitution. They have been sold by their families  often to wealthy Arab tourists. This is just one face of a booming  sex trade across the Arab region. Now raise your hand if any of  this is sounding familiar to you  from your part of the world. Yeah. It's not as if the Arab world has a monopoly on sexual hangups. And although we don't yet have an Arab Kinsey Report to tell us exactly what's happening  inside bedrooms across the Arab region  It's pretty clear that  something is not right. Double standards for men and women  sex as a source of shame  family control limiting individual choices  and a vast gulf between appearance and reality  what people are doing and what they're willing to admit to  and a general reluctance to move  beyond private whispers to a serious and sustained public discussion. As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me   Here  sex is the opposite of sport. Football  everybody talks about it  but hardly anyone plays. But sex  everybody is doing it  but nobody wants to talk about it.   Laughter  SEF  I want to give you a piece of advice  which if you follow it  will make you happy in life. When your husband reaches out to you  when he seizes a part of your body  sigh deeply and look at him lustily. When he penetrates you with his penis  try to talk flirtatiously and  move yourself in harmony with him. Hot stuff  And it might sound that these handy hints come from  The Joy of Sex  or YouPorn. But in fact  they come from a   th century Arabic book called  The Encyclopedia of Pleasure   which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia  and everything in between. The Encyclopedia is just one  in a long line of Arabic erotica  much of it written by religious scholars. Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad  there is a rich tradition in Islam of talking frankly about sex  not just its problems  but also its pleasures  and not just for men  but also for women. A thousand years ago  we used to have  whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic. Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature  position and preference  a body of language that was rich enough to make up the body  of the woman you see on this page. Today  this history is largely unknown  in the Arab region. Even by educated people  who often feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do in their own tongue. Today's sexual landscape looks a lot like Europe and America on the brink of the sexual revolution. But while the West has opened on sex  what we found is that Arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction. In Egypt and many of its neighbors  this closing down is part of a wider closing in political  social and cultural thought. And it is the product of a complex historical process  one which has gained ground with the rise  of Islamic conservatism since the late     s.  Just say no  is what conservatives  around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo. In the Arab region  they brand these attempts as a Western conspiracy to undermine traditional Arab and Islamic values. But what's really at stake here is one of their most powerful tools of control  sex wrapped up in religion. But history shows us that  even as recently as our fathers' and grandfathers' day  there have been times of greater pragmatism  and tolerance  and a willingness to consider other interpretations  be it abortion  or masturbation  or even  the incendiary topic of homosexuality. It is not black and white  as conservatives would have us believe. In these  as in so many other matters  Islam offers us at least    shades of gray. Over my travels  I've met men and women  across the Arab region who've been exploring that spectrum    sexologists who are trying to help couples find greater happiness in their marriages  innovators who are managing to get  sexuality education into schools  small groups of men and women  lesbian  gay  transgendered  transsexual  who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real world support. Women  and increasingly men  who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home. Groups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against HIV and other occupational hazards  and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza find a place in society  and critically  stay with their kids. Now these efforts are small   they're often underfunded  and they face formidable opposition. But I am optimistic that  in the long run  times are changing  and they and their ideas will gain ground. Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region through dramatic confrontation  beating or indeed baring of breasts  but rather through negotiation. What we're talking here is not about a  sexual revolution  but a sexual evolution   learning from other parts of the world  adapting to local conditions  forging our own path  not following one blazed by another. That path  I hope  will one day lead us  to the right to control our own bodies  and to access the information  and services we need to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives. The right to express our ideas freely  to marry whom we choose   to choose our own partners  to be sexually active or not  to decide whether to have children and when  all this without violence or force or discrimination. Now we are very far from this  across the Arab region  and so much needs to change  law  education  media  the economy  the list goes on and on  and it is the work of a generation  at least. But it begins with a journey that I myself have made  asking hard questions of received wisdoms in sexual life. And it is a journey which has only served to strengthen my faith  and my appreciation of local histories and cultures by showing me possibilities  where I once only saw absolutes. Now given the turmoil in many countries in the Arab region  talking about sex   challenging the taboos  seeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury. But at this critical moment in history  if we do not anchor freedom and justice  dignity and equality  privacy and autonomy in our personal lives  in our sexual lives  we will find it very hard to achieve in public life. The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows  and that is true for us all. no matter where we live and love. Thank you. Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grandmother  Mamar  in our four family home in Brooklyn  New York. Her apartment was an oasis. It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee  which was really warm milk  with just a touch of caffeine. She loved life. And although she worked in a factory  she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe. And I remember poring over those pictures with her and then dancing with her to her favorite music. And then  when I was eight and she was     something changed. She no longer worked or traveled. She no longer danced. There were no more coffee times. My mother missed work and took her to doctors who couldn't make a diagnosis. And my father  who worked at night   would spend every afternoon with her  just to make sure she ate. Her care became all consuming for our family. And by the time a diagnosis was made  she was in a deep spiral. Now many of you will recognize her symptoms. My grandmother had depression. A deep  life altering depression  from which she never recovered. And back then  so little  was known about depression. But even today     years later  there's still so much more to learn. Today  we know that women  are    percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men. And even with this high prevalence  women are misdiagnosed between     and    percent of the time. Now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms  of fatigue  sleep disturbance  pain and anxiety compared with men. And these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression. And it isn't only depression in which  these sex differences occur  but they occur across so many diseases. So it's my grandmother's struggles that have really led me on a lifelong quest. And today  I lead a center in which the mission is to discover why these sex differences occur and to use that knowledge to improve the health of women. Today  we know that every cell has a sex. Now  that's a term coined  by the Institute of Medicine. And what it means is that  men and women are different down to the cellular and molecular levels. It means that we're different  across all of our organs. From our brains to our hearts  our lungs  our joints. Now  it was only    years ago that we hardly had any data on women's health beyond our reproductive functions. But then in       the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law. And what this law did was it mandated that women and minorities  be included in clinical trials that were funded by the National Institutes of Health. And in many ways  the law has worked. Women are now routinely  included in clinical studies  and we've learned that there are major differences in the ways that women and men experience disease. But remarkably  what we have learned about these  differences is often overlooked. So  we have to ask ourselves the question  Why leave women's health to chance  And we're leaving it to chance in two ways. The first is that there is so much more to learn and we're not making the investment in fully understanding the extent  of these sex differences. And the second is that we aren't  taking what we have learned  and routinely applying it in clinical care. We are just not doing enough. So  I'm going to share with you three examples of where sex differences have  impacted the health of women  and where we need to do more. Let's start with heart disease. It's the number one killer of women  in the United States today. This is the face of heart disease. Linda is a middle aged woman  who had a stent placed in one of the arteries going to her heart. When she had recurring symptoms  she went back to her doctor. Her doctor did the gold standard test  a cardiac catheterization. It showed no blockages. Linda's symptoms continued. She had to stop working. And that's when she found us. When Linda came to us  we did  another cardiac catheterization and this time  we found clues. But we needed another test to make the diagnosis. So we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound  where you use soundwaves to look at the artery from the inside out. And what we found was that Linda's disease didn't look like the typical male disease. The typical male disease looks like this. There's a discrete blockage or stenosis. Linda's disease  like the disease of so many women  looks like this. The plaque is laid down more evenly  more diffusely along the artery  and it's harder to see. So for Linda  and for so many women  the gold standard test wasn't gold. Now  Linda received the right treatment. She went back to her life and  fortunately  today she is doing well. But Linda was lucky. She found us  we found her disease. But for too many women  that's not the case. We have the tools. We have the technology to make the diagnosis. But it's all too often that these sex diffferences are overlooked. So what about treatment  A landmark study that was published two years ago asked the very important question  What are the most effective treatments  for heart disease in women  The authors looked at papers  written over a    year period  and hundreds had to be thrown out. And what they found out was that  of those that were tossed out     percent were excluded because even though women  were included in the studies  the analysis didn't differentiate  between women and men. What a lost opportunity. The money had been spent and we didn't learn how women fared. And these studies could not contribute one iota to the very  very important question  what are the most effective treatments for heart disease in women  I want to introduce you to  Hortense  my godmother  Hung Wei  a relative of a colleague  and somebody you may recognize    Dana  Christopher Reeve's wife. All three women have something  very important in common. All three were diagnosed with lung cancer  the number one cancer killer of women in the United States today. All three were nonsmokers. Sadly  Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease. Today  what we know is that women who are nonsmokers are three times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men who are nonsmokers. Now interestingly  when women are  diagnosed with lung cancer  their survival tends to be better than that of men. Now  here are some clues. Our investigators have found that there are certain genes in the lung tumor  cells of both women and men. And these genes are activated mainly by estrogen. And when these genes are over expressed  it's associated with improved survival only in young women. Now this is a very early finding and we don't yet know whether it has relevance to clinical care. But it's findings like this that may provide hope and may provide an opportunity to save lives of both women and men. Now  let me share with you an example of when we do consider sex differences  it can drive the science. Several years ago a new lung cancer drug was being evaluated  and when the authors looked  at whose tumors shrank  they found that    percent were women. This led them to ask the question  Well  why  And what they found was that the genetic mutations  that the drug targeted were far more common in women. And what this has led to is a more personalized approach to the treatment of lung cancer  that also includes sex. This is what we can accomplish when we don't leave women's health to chance. We know that when you invest in research  you get results. Take a look at the death rate  from breast cancer over time. And now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time. Now let's look at the dollars  invested in breast cancer    these are the dollars invested per death    and the dollars invested in lung cancer. Now  it's clear that our investment in breast cancer has produced results. They may not be fast enough  but it has produced results. We can do the same for lung cancer and for every other disease. So let's go back to depression. Depression is the number one cause of disability in women in the world today. Our investigators have found that there are differences in the brains of women and men in the areas that are connected with mood. And when you put men and women in a functional MRI scanner    that's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated    so you put them in the scanner  and you expose them to stress. You can actually see the difference. And it's findings like this that we believe hold some of the clues for why we see these very significant sex differences in depression. But even though we know that these differences occur     percent of the brain research that begins in animals is done in either male animals or animals in whom the sex is not identified. So  I think we have to ask again the question  Why leave women's health to chance  And this is a question that haunts those of us in science and medicine who believe that we are on the verge  of being able to dramatically improve the health of women. We know that every cell has a sex. We know that these differences  are often overlooked. And therefore we know that women  are not getting the full benefit of modern science and medicine today. We have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum. Women's health is an equal rights issue as important as equal pay. And it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine. So imagine the momentum we could achieve in advancing the health of women if we considered whether these  sex differences were present at the very beginning of designing research. Or if we analyzed our data by sex. So  people often ask me  What can I do  And here's what I suggest  First  I suggest that you think about women's health in the same way that you think and care about other  causes that are important to you. And second  and equally as important  that as a woman  you have to ask your doctor and the doctors who are caring  for those who you love  Is this disease or treatment different in women  Now  this is a profound question  because the answer is likely yes  but your doctor may not know  the answer  at least not yet. But if you ask the question   your doctor will very likely go looking for the answer. And this is so important  not only for ourselves  but for all of those whom we love. Whether it be a mother  a daughter  a sister  a friend or a grandmother. It was my grandmother's suffering that inspired my work to improve the health of women. That's her legacy. Our legacy can be to improve the health of women for this generation and for generations to come. Thank you. I have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas  Why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies where I work  I have worked with more than     companies. Despite all the technological advances    computers  I.T.  communications  telecommunications  the Internet. Enigma number two  Why is there so little engagement at work  Why do people feel so miserable  even actively disengaged  Disengaging their colleagues. Acting against the interest of their company. Despite all the affiliation events  the celebration  the people initiatives  the leadership development programs to train managers on how to better motivate their teams. At the beginning  I thought there was a chicken and egg issue  Because people are less engaged   they are less productive. Or vice versa  because they are less productive  we put more pressure and they are less engaged. But as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates  in fact  to the basic  pillars of management. The way we organize is based on two pillars. The hard    structure  processes  systems. The soft    feelings  sentiments  interpersonal relationships  traits  personality. And whenever a company reorganizes  restructures  reengineers  goes through a cultural transformation program  it chooses these two pillars. Now  we try to refine them  we try to combine them. The real issue is    and this is the answer to the two enigmas    these pillars are obsolete. Everything you read in business books is based either on one or the other or their combination. They are obsolete. How do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business  The hard approach  basically  is that you start from strategy  requirements  structures  processes   systems  KPIs  scorecards  committees  headquarters  hubs  clusters  you name it. I forgot all the metrics  incentives  committees   middle offices and interfaces. What happens basically on the left  you have more complexity  the  new complexity of business. We need quality  cost  reliability  speed. And every time there is a new requirement  we use the same approach. We create dedicated structure processed systems  basically to deal with the  new complexity of business. The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization. Let's take an example. An automotive company  the engineering division is a five dimensional matrix. If you open any cell of the matrix  you find another    dimensional matrix. You have Mr. Noise  Mr. Petrol Consumption  Mr. Anti Collision Properties. For any new requirement  you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement. What happens when the new  requirement emerges  Some years ago  a new requirement appeared on the marketplace  the length of the warranty period. So therefore the new requirement is repairability  making cars easy to repair. Otherwise when you bring the car  to the garage to fix the light  if you have to remove the engine to access the lights  the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours  and the  warranty budget will explode. So  what was the solution using the hard approach  If repairability is the new requirement  the solution is to create a new function  Mr. Repairability. And Mr. Repairability creates  the repairability process. With a repairability scorecard   with a repairability metric and eventually repairability incentive. That came on top of    other KPIs. What percentage of these people is variable compensation  Twenty percent at most  divided by    KPIs  repairability makes a difference of  .  percent. What difference did it make in their actions  their choices to simplify  Zero. But what occurs for zero impact   Mr. Repairability  process  scorecard  evaluation  coordination  with the    other coordinators to have zero impact. Now  in front of the new complexity of business  the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines. It is basically the interplay. How the parts work together. The connections  the interactions  the synapses. It is not the skeleton of boxes   it is the nervous system of adaptiveness and intelligence. You know  you could call it cooperation  basically. Whenever people cooperate  they use less resources. In everything. You know  the repairability issue is a cooperation problem. When you design cars  please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages. When we don't cooperate we need more time  more equipment  more systems  more teams. We need    When procurement  supply  chain  manufacturing don't cooperate we need more stock  more inventories   more working capital. Who will pay for that  Shareholders  Customers  No  they will refuse. So who is left   The employees  who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation. Stress  burnout  they are  overwhelmed  accidents. No wonder they disengage. How do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation  The hard  In banks  when there is a problem between the back office and the front office  they don't cooperate. What is the solution  They create a middle office. What happens one year later  Instead of one problem  between the back and the front  now I have two problems. Between the back and the middle and between the middle and the front. Plus I have to pay for the middle office. The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation. It can only add new boxes   new bones in the skeleton. The soft approach  To make people cooperate  we need  to make them like each other. Improve interpersonal feelings  the more people like each other   the more they will cooperate. It is totally wrong. It is even counterproductive. Look  at home I have two TVs. Why  Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife. Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife. And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because I love my wife. If I didn't love my wife  one TV would be enough  You will watch my favorite football game  if you are not happy  how is the book or the door  The more we like each other  the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships  by imposing tough tradeoffs. And we go for a second TV or we escalate the decision above for arbitration. Definitely  these approaches are obsolete. To deal with complexity  to enhance the nervous system  we have created what we call  the smart simplicity approach based on simple rules. Simple rule number one  Understand what others do. What is their real work  We need to go beyond the boxes  the job descriptions  beyond the surface of the container  to understand the real content. Me  designer  if I put a wire here  I know that it will mean that we will have to remove the engine to access the lights. Second  you need to reenforce integrators. Integrators are not middle  offices  they are managers  existing managers that you reinforce so that they have power and interest to make others cooperate. How can you reinforce your  managers as integrators  By removing layers. When there are too many layers people are too far from the action  therefore they need KPIs  metrics  they need poor proxies for reality. They don't understand reality and they add the complicatedness of metrics  KPIs. By removing rules    the bigger we are  the more we need integrators  therefore the less rules we must have  to give discretionary power to managers. And we do the opposite    the bigger we are  the more rules we create. And we end up with the Encyclopedia  Britannica of rules. You need to increase the quanitity of power so that you can empower everybody to use their judgment  their intelligence. You must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards to take the risk to cooperate  to move out of insulation. Otherwise  they will withdraw. They will disengage. These rules  they come from game theory and organizational sociology. You can increase the shadow of the future. Create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions. This is what the automotive company did when they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact. They said to the design engineers  Now  in three years  when the new  car is launched on the market  you will move to the after sales  network  and become in charge of the warranty budget  and if the warranty budget explodes  it will explode in your face.  Laughter  Much more powerful than  .   percent variable compensation. You need also to increase reciprocity  by removing the buffers that make us self sufficient. When you remove these buffers  you hold me by the nose  I hold you by the ear. We will cooperate. Remove the second TV. There are many second TVs at work that don't create value  they just provide dysfunctional self sufficiency. You need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don't cooperate. The CEO of The Lego Group  Jorgen Vig Knudstorp  has a great way to use it. He says  blame is not for failure  it is for failing to help or ask for help. It changes everything. Suddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses  my real forecast  because I know I will not be blamed if I fail  but if I fail to help or ask for help. When you do this  it has a lot of implications on organizational design. You stop drawing boxes  dotted lines  full lines  you look at their interplay. It has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use. On human resource management practices. When you do that  you can manage complexity  the new complexity of business  without getting complicated. You create more value with lower cost. You simultaneously improve  performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common root cause that hinders both. Complicatedness  This is your  battle  business leaders. The real battle is not against competitors. This is rubbish  very abstract. When do we meet competitors to fight them  The real battle is against ourselves  against our bureaucracy  our complicatedness. Only you can fight  can do it. Thank you. Joe Kowan  I have stage fright. I've always had stage fright  and not just a little bit  it's a big bit. And it didn't even matter until I was   . That's when I started writing songs  and even then I only played them for myself. Just knowing my roommates were in the  same house made me uncomfortable. But after a couple of years   just writing songs wasn't enough. I had all these stories and ideas  and I wanted to share them with people  but physiologically  I couldn't do it. I had this irrational fear. But the more I wrote  and the more I practiced  the more I wanted to perform. So on the week of my   th birthday  I decided I was going to go to this local open mic  and put this fear behind me. Well  when I got there  it was packed. There were like    people there. And they all looked angry. But I took a deep breath  and I signed up to play  and I felt pretty good. Pretty good  until about    minutes before my turn  when my whole body rebelled  and  this wave of anxiety just washed over me. Now  when you experience fear   your sympathetic nervous system kicks in. So you have a rush of adrenaline   your heart rate increases  your breathing gets faster. Next your non essential systems start  to shut down  like digestion.  Laughter  So your mouth gets dry  and blood is routed away from your extremities  so your fingers don't work anymore. Your pupils dilate  your muscles contract  your Spidey sense tingles  basically your whole body is trigger happy.  Laughter  That condition is not conducive  to performing folk music. I mean  your nervous system is an idiot. Really  Two hundred thousand years of human evolution  and it still can't tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and    folksingers on a Tuesday night open mic  I have never been more terrified    until now. So then it was my turn  and somehow  I get myself onto  the stage  I start my song  I open my mouth to sing the first line  and this completely horrible vibrato    you know  when your voice wavers     comes streaming out. And this is not the good kind of vibrato   like an opera singer has  this is my whole body just convulsing with fear. I mean  it's a nightmare. I'm embarrassed  the audience  is clearly uncomfortable  they're focused on my discomfort. It was so bad. But that was my first real experience  as a solo singer songwriter. And something good did happen    I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for. And I wanted more. But I knew  I had to get past this nervousness. That night I promised myself   I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore. And I did. I went back every single week  and sure enough  week after week  it didn't get any better. The same  thing happened every week.  Laughter  I couldn't shake it. And that's when I had an epiphany. And I remember it really well  because I  don't have a lot of epiphanies.  Laughter  All I had to do was write a song  that exploits my nervousness. That only seems authentic when I have stage fright  and the more nervous I was  the better the song would be. Easy. So I started writing a song about having stage fright. First  fessing up to the problem  the physical manifestations  how I would feel  how the listener might feel. And then accounting for things like my shaky voice  and I knew I would be singing about a  half octave higher than normal  because I was nervous. By having a song that explained  what was happening to me  while it was happening  that gave the audience permission to think about it. They didn't have to feel bad  for me because I was nervous  they could experience that with me  and we were all one big happy  nervous   uncomfortable family.  Laughter  By thinking about my audience   by embracing and exploiting my problem  I was able to take something  that was blocking my progress  and turn it into something that  was essential for my success. And having the stage fright song let  me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance. And then I could move on   and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease. And eventually  over time  I didn't  have to play the stage fright song at all. Except for when I was really  nervous  like now.  Laughter  Would it be okay if I played the  stage fright song for you  Can I have a sip of water  Thank you.   I'm not joking  you know      this stage fright is real.     And if I'm up here trembling and singing      well  you'll know how I feel.     And the mistake I'd be making      the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking.     As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me      well  you don't have to be.     Well  maybe just a little bit.     And maybe I'll try to imagine  you all without clothes.     But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows.     Not to discuss this at length      but my body image was never my strength.     So frankly  I wish that you all would get dressed      I mean  you're not even really naked.     And I'm the one with the problem.     And you tell me  don't worry  so much  you'll be great.     But I'm the one living with me     and I know how I get.     Your advice is gentle but late.     If not just a bit patronizing.     And that sarcastic tone doesn't  help me when I sing.     But we shouldn't talk about  these things right now      really  I'm up on stage  and  you're in the crowd. Hi.     And I'm not making fun of  unnurtured  irrational fear      and if I wasn't ready to face this      I sure as hell wouldn't be here.     But if I belt one note out clearly      you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely.     And maybe next week  I'll set my guitar ringin'     my voice clear as water  and everyone singin'.     But probably I'll just get up and start groovin'      my vocal cords movin'      at speeds slightly faster than sound.   I'd like to reimagine education. The last year has seen the invention of a new four letter word. It starts with an M. MOOC  massive open online courses. Many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world  in the millions  for free. Anybody who has an Internet connection and the will to learn can access these great courses from excellent universities and get a credential at the end of it. Now  in this discussion today  I'm going to focus on a different aspect of MOOCs. We are taking what we are learning and the technologies we are developing in the large and applying them in the small to create a blended model of education to really reinvent and reimagine what we do in the classroom. Now  our classrooms could use change. So  here's a classroom at this little three letter institute in the Northeast of America  MIT. And this was a classroom about    or    years ago  and this is a classroom today. What's changed  The seats are in color. Whoop de do. Education really hasn't changed in the past     years. The last big innovation in education was the printing press and the textbooks. Everything else has changed around us. You know  from healthcare to transportation  everything is different  but education hasn't changed. It's also been a real issue in terms of access. So what you see here is not a rock concert. And the person you see at the end of the stage is not Madonna. This is a classroom at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria. Now  we've all heard of distance education  but the students way in the back      feet away from the instructor  I think they are undergoing long distance education. Now  I really believe that we can transform education  both in quality and scale and access  through technology. For example  at edX  we are trying to transform education through online technologies. Given education has been calcified for     years  we really cannot think about reengineering it  micromanaging it. We really have to completely reimagine it. It's like going from ox carts to the airplane. Even the infrastructure has to change. Everything has to change. We need to go from lectures on the blackboard to online exercises  online videos. We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories and gamification. We have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards. Everything really has to change. So at edX and a number of other organizations  we are applying these technologies to education through MOOCs to really increase access to education. And you heard of this example  where  when we launched our very first course    and this was an MIT hard circuits and electronics course    about a year and a half ago          students from     countries enrolled in this course. And we had no marketing budget. Now          is a big number. This number is bigger than the total number of alumni of MIT in its     year history.       students passed the course  and this was a hard course.       is also a big number. If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year  I would have to teach for    years before I could teach this many students. Now these large numbers are just one part of the story. So today  I want to discuss a different aspect  the other side of MOOCs  take a different perspective. We are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom  to create a blended model of learning. But before I go into that  let me tell you a story. When my daughter turned     became a teenager  she stopped speaking English  and she began speaking this new language. I call it teen lish. It's a digital language. It's got two sounds  a grunt and a silence.  Honey  come over for dinner.   Hmm.   Did you hear me   Silence.  Laughter   Can you listen to me    quot Hmm. quot  So we had a real issue with communicating  and we were just not communicating  until one day I had this epiphany. I texted her.  Laughter  I got an instant response. I said  no  that must have been by accident. She must have thought  you know  some friend of hers was calling her. So I texted her again. Boom  another response. I said  this is great. And so since then  our life has changed. I text her  she responds. It's just been absolutely great. So our millennial generation is built differently. Now  I'm older  and my youthful looks might belie that  but I'm not in the millennial generation. But our kids are really different. The millennial generation is completely comfortable with online technology. So why are we fighting it in the classroom  Let's not fight it. Let's embrace it. In fact  I believe    and I have two fat thumbs  I can't text very well    but I'm willing to bet that with evolution  our kids and their grandchildren will develop really  really little  itty bitty thumbs to text much better  that evolution will fix all of that stuff. But what if we embraced technology  embraced the millennial generation's natural predilections  and really think about creating these online technologies  blend them into their lives. So here's what we can do. So rather than driving our kids into a classroom  herding them out there at   o'clock in the morning    I hated going to class at   o'clock in the morning  so why are we forcing our kids to do that  So instead what you do is you have them watch videos and do interactive exercises in the comfort of their dorm rooms  in their bedroom  in the dining room  in the bathroom  wherever they're most creative. Then they come into the classroom for some in person interaction. They can have discussions amongst themselves. They can solve problems together. They can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions. In fact  with edX  when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world  this was happening unbeknownst to us. Two high school teachers at the Sant High School in Mongolia had flipped their classroom  and they were using our video lectures and interactive exercises  where the learners in the high school     year olds  mind you  would go and do these things in their own homes and they would come into class  and as you see from this image here  they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work. And the only way we discovered this was they wrote a blog and we happened to stumble upon that blog. We were also doing other pilots. So we did a pilot experimental blended courses  working with San Jose State University in California  again  with the circuits and electronics course. You'll hear that a lot. That course has become sort of like our petri dish of learning. So there  the students would  again  the instructors flipped the classroom  blended online and in person  and the results were staggering. Now don't take these results to the bank just yet. Just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more  but the early results are incredible. So traditionally  semester upon semester  for the past several years  this course  again  a hard course  had a failure rate of about    to    percent every semester. With this blended class late last year  the failure rate fell to nine percent. So the results can be extremely  extremely good. Now before we go too far into this  I'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas. What are some key ideas that makes all of this work  One idea is active learning. The idea here is  rather than have students walk into class and watch lectures  we replace this with what we call lessons. Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises. So a student might watch a five   seven minute video and follow that with an interactive exercise. Think of this as the ultimate Socratization of education. You teach by asking questions. And this is a form of learning called active learning  and really promoted by a very early paper  in       by Craik and Lockhart  where they said and discovered that learning and retention really relates strongly to the depth of mental processing. Students learn much better when they are interacting with the material. The second idea is self pacing. Now  when I went to a lecture hall  and if you were like me  by the fifth minute I would lose the professor. I wasn't all that smart  and I would be scrambling  taking notes  and then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour. Instead  wouldn't it be nice with online technologies  we offer videos and interactive engagements to students  They can hit the pause button. They can rewind the professor. Heck  they can even mute the professor. So this form of self pacing can be very helpful to learning. The third idea that we have is instant feedback. With instant feedback  the computer grades exercises. I mean  how else do you teach         students  Your computer is grading all the exercises. And we've all submitted homeworks  and your grades come back two weeks later  you've forgotten all about it. I don't think I've still received some of my homeworks from my undergraduate days. Some are never graded. So with instant feedback  students can try to apply answers. If they get it wrong  they can get instant feedback. They can try it again and try it again  and this really becomes much more engaging. They get the instant feedback  and this little green check mark that you see here is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX. Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark. In fact  one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year  he then went on to take a software course from Berkeley at the end of the year  and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course about the green check mark   quot Oh god  have I missed you. quot  When's the last time you've seen students posting comments like this about homework  My colleague Ed Bertschinger  who heads up the physics department at MIT  has this to say about instant feedback  He indicated that instant feedback turns teaching moments into learning outcomes. The next big idea is gamification. You know  all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on. You know  they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it. So we applied these gamification techniques to learning  and we can build these online laboratories. How do you teach creativity  How do you teach design  We can do this through online labs and use computing power to build these online labs. So as this little video shows here  you can engage students much like they design with Legos. So here  the learners are building a circuit with Lego like ease. And this can also be graded by the computer. Fifth is peer learning. So here  we use discussion forums and discussions and Facebook like interaction not as a distraction  but to really help students learn. Let me tell you a story. When we did our circuits course for the         students  I didn't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course. I told my TAs  okay        we're going to be up monitoring the forum  answering questions. They had answered questions for     students. How do you do that for          So one night I'm sitting up there  at   a.m. at night  and I think there's this question from a student from Pakistan  and he asked a question  and I said  okay  let me go and type up an answer  I don't type all that fast  and I begin typing up the answer  and before I can finish  another student from Egypt popped in with an answer  not quite right  so I'm fixing the answer  and before I can finish  a student from the U.S. had popped in with a different answer. And then I sat back  fascinated. Boom  boom  boom  boom  the students were discussing and interacting with each other  and by   a.m. that night  I'm totally fascinated  having this epiphany  and by   a.m. in the morning  they had discovered the right answer. And all I had to do was go and bless it   Good answer.  So this is absolutely amazing  where students are learning from each other  and they're telling us that they are learning by teaching. Now this is all not just in the future. This is happening today. So we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and  high schools around the world  from Tsinghua in China to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia to Berkeley in California    all over the world. And these kinds of technologies really help  the blended model can really help revolutionize education. It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs  the business aspect. We can also license these MOOC courses to other universities  and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs  where the university that licenses it with the professor can use these online courses like the next generation textbook. They can use as much or as little as they like  and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal. Finally  I would like to have you dream with me for a little bit. I would like us to really reimagine education. We will have to move from lecture halls to e spaces. We have to move from books to tablets like the Aakash in India or the Raspberry Pi     dollars. The Aakash is    dollars. We have to move from bricks and mortar school buildings to digital dormitories. But I think at the end of the day  I think we will still need one lecture hall in our universities. Otherwise  how else do we tell our grandchildren that your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end talk about content and  you know  you didn't even have a rewind button  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  In       I became the attorney general of the state of New Jersey. Before that  I'd been a criminal prosecutor  first in the Manhattan district attorney's office  and then at the United States Department of Justice. But when I became the attorney general  two things happened that changed  the way I see criminal justice. The first is that I asked what I thought were really basic questions. I wanted to understand who we were arresting  who we were charging  and who we were putting in our nation's jails and prisons. I also wanted to understand if we were making decisions in a way that made us safer. And I couldn't get this information out. It turned out that most big criminal justice agencies like my own didn't track the things that matter. So after about a month of being incredibly frustrated  I walked down into a conference room that was filled with detectives and stacks and stacks of case files  and the detectives were sitting there with yellow legal pads taking notes. They were trying to get the information I was looking for by going through case by case for the past five years. And as you can imagine  when we finally got the results  they weren't good. It turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in Trenton. The second thing that happened is that I spent the day in the Camden  New Jersey police department. Now  at that time  Camden  New Jersey  was the most dangerous city in America. I ran the Camden Police Department because of that. I spent the day in the police department  and I was taken into a room with senior police officials  all of whom were working hard and trying very hard to reduce crime in Camden. And what I saw in that room  as we talked about how to reduce crime  were a series of officers with a lot of little yellow sticky notes. And they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board. And one of them said    We had a robbery two weeks ago. We have no suspects.  And another said   We had a shooting in this neighborhood last week. We have no suspects.  We weren't using data driven policing. We were essentially trying to fight crime with yellow Post it notes. Now  both of these things made me realize fundamentally that we were failing. We didn't even know who was in our criminal justice system  we didn't have any data about the things that mattered  and we didn't share data or use analytics or tools to help us make better decisions and to reduce crime. And for the first time  I started to think about how we made decisions. When I was an assistant D.A.  and when I was a federal prosecutor  I looked at the cases in front of me  and I generally made decisions based on my instinct and my experience. When I became attorney general  I could look at the system as a whole  and what surprised me is that I found that that was exactly how we were doing it across the entire system    in police departments  in prosecutors's offices  in courts and in jails. And what I learned very quickly is that we weren't doing a good job. So I wanted to do things differently. I wanted to introduce data and analytics and rigorous statistical analysis into our work. In short  I wanted to moneyball criminal justice. Now  moneyball  as many of you know  is what the Oakland A's did  where they used smart data and statistics to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games  and they went from a system that  was based on baseball scouts who used to go out and watch players and use their instinct and experience  the scouts' instincts and experience  to pick players  from one to use smart data and rigorous statistical analysis to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games. It worked for the Oakland A's  and it worked in the state of New Jersey. We took Camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in America. We reduced murders there by    percent  which actually means    lives were saved. And we reduced all crime in the city by    percent. We also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions. So we went from doing low level drug crimes that were outside our building to doing cases of statewide importance  on things like reducing violence with the most violent offenders  prosecuting street gangs  gun and drug trafficking  and political corruption. And all of this matters greatly  because public safety to me is the most important function of government. If we're not safe  we can't be educated  we can't be healthy  we can't do any of the other things we want to do in our lives. And we live in a country today where we face serious criminal justice problems. We have    million arrests every single year. The vast majority of those arrests are for low level crimes  like misdemeanors     to    percent. Less than five percent of all arrests are for violent crime. Yet we spend    billion  that's b for billion  dollars a year on state and local corrections costs. Right now  today  we have  .  million people in our jails and prisons. And we face unbelievable public safety challenges because we have a situation in which two thirds of the people in our jails are there waiting for trial. They haven't yet been convicted of a crime. They're just waiting for their day in court. And    percent of people come back. Our recidivism rate is amongst  the highest in the world. Almost seven in    people who are released from prison will be rearrested in a constant cycle of crime and incarceration. So when I started my job at the Arnold Foundation  I came back to looking at a lot of these questions  and I came back to thinking about how we had used data and analytics to transform the way we did criminal justice in New Jersey. And when I look at the criminal justice system in the United States today  I feel the exact same way that I did about the state of New Jersey when I started there  which is that we absolutely have to do better  and I know that we can do better. So I decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision in public safety  and that decision is the determination of whether  when someone has been arrested  whether they pose a risk to public safety and should be detained  or whether they don't pose a risk to public safety and should be released. Everything that happens in criminal cases comes out of this one decision. It impacts everything. It impacts sentencing. It impacts whether someone gets drug treatment. It impacts crime and violence. And when I talk to judges around the United States  which I do all the time now  they all say the same thing  which is that we put dangerous people in jail  and we let non dangerous  nonviolent people out. They mean it and they believe it. But when you start to look at the data  which  by the way  the judges don't have  when we start to look at the data  what we find time and time again  is that this isn't the case. We find low risk offenders  which makes up    percent of our entire criminal justice population  we find that they're in jail. Take Leslie Chew  who was a Texas man who stole four blankets on a cold winter night. He was arrested  and he was kept in jail on       dollars bail  an amount that he could not afford to pay. And he stayed in jail for eight months until his case came up for trial  at a cost to taxpayers of more than       dollars. And at the other end of the spectrum  we're doing an equally terrible job. The people who we find are the highest risk offenders  the people who we think have the highest likelihood of committing a new crime if they're released  we see nationally that    percent of those people are being released. The reason for this is the way we make decisions. Judges have the best intentions when they make these decisions about risk  but they're making them subjectively. They're like the baseball scouts    years ago who were using their instinct and their experience to try to decide what risk someone poses. They're being subjective  and we know what happens with subjective decision making  which is that we are often wrong. What we need in this space are strong data and analytics. What I decided to look for was a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool  something that would let judges actually understand with a scientific and objective way what the risk was that was posed by someone in front of them. I looked all over the country  and I found that between five and    percent of all U.S. jurisdictions actually use any type of risk assessment tool  and when I looked at these tools  I quickly realized why. They were unbelievably expensive to administer  they were time consuming  they were limited to the local jurisdiction in which they'd been created. So basically  they couldn't be scaled or transferred to other places. So I went out and built a phenomenal team of data scientists and researchers and statisticians to build a universal risk assessment tool  so that every single judge in the United States of America can have an objective  scientific measure of risk. In the tool that we've built  what we did was we collected  .  million cases from all around the United States  from cities  from counties  from every single state in the country  the federal districts. And with those  .  million cases  which is the largest data set on pretrial in the United States today  we were able to basically find that there were     plus risk factors that we could look at to try to figure out what mattered most. And we found that there were nine specific things that mattered all across the country and that were the most highly predictive of risk. And so we built a universal risk assessment tool. And it looks like this. As you'll see  we put some information in  but most of it is incredibly simple  it's easy to use  it focuses on things like the defendant's prior convictions  whether they've been sentenced to incarceration  whether they've engaged in violence before  whether they've even failed to come back to court. And with this tool  we can predict three things. First  whether or not someone will commit a new crime if they're released. Second  for the first time  and I think this is incredibly important  we can predict whether someone will commit an act of violence if they're released. And that's the single most important thing that judges say when you talk to them. And third  we can predict whether someone will come back to court. And every single judge in the United States of America can use it  because it's been created on a universal data set. What judges see if they run the risk assessment tool is this    it's a dashboard. At the top  you see the New Criminal Activity Score  six of course being the highest  and then in the middle you see   Elevated risk of violence.  What that says is that this person is someone who has an elevated risk of violence that the judge should look twice at. And then  towards the bottom  you see the Failure to Appear Score  which again is the likelihood that someone will come back to court. Now I want to say something really important. It's not that I think we should be eliminating the judge's instinct and experience from this process. I don't. I actually believe the problem that we see and the reason that we have these incredible system errors  where we're incarcerating low level  nonviolent people and we're releasing high risk  dangerous people  is that we don't have an objective measure of risk. But what I believe should happen is that we should take that data driven risk assessment and combine that with the judge's instinct and experience to lead us to better decision making. The tool went statewide in Kentucky on July    and we're about to go up in a number of other U.S. jurisdictions. Our goal  quite simply  is that every single judge in the United States will use a data driven risk tool within the next five years. We're now working on risk tools for prosecutors and for police officers as well  to try to take a system that runs today in America the same way it did    years ago  based on instinct and experience  and make it into one that runs on data and analytics. Now  the great news about all this  and we have a ton of work left to do  and we have a lot of culture to change  but the great news about all of it is that we know it works. It's why Google is Google  and it's why all these baseball teams use moneyball to win games. The great news for us as well is that it's the way that we can transform the American criminal justice system. It's how we can make our streets safer  we can reduce our prison costs  and we can make our system much fairer and more just. Some people call it data science. I call it moneyballing criminal justice. Thank you. I'm McKenna Pope. I'm    years old  and when I was     I convinced one of the largest toy companies  toymakers  in the world  Hasbro  to change the way that they marketed one of their most best selling products. So allow me to tell you about it. So I have a brother  Gavin. When this whole shebang happened  he was four. He loved to cook. He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these  needless to say  uneatable concoctions  or making invisible macaroni and cheese. He wanted to be a chef really badly. And so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef than an Easy Bake Oven. Right  I mean  we all had those when we were little. And he wanted one so badly. But then he started to realize something. In the commercials  and on the  boxes for the Easy Bake Ovens  Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls. And the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials  and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens and it would be in bright pink and purple  very gender specific colors to females  right  So it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook  boys aren't. And this discouraged my brother a lot. He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef  because that was something that girls did. Girls cooked  boys didn't  or so was the message that Hasbro was sending. And this got me thinking  God  I wish there was a way that I could change this  that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it. And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. Change.org is an online petition sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks  through Facebook  through Twitter  through YouTube  through Reddit  through Tumblr  through whatever you can think of. And so I created a petition along with the YouTube video that I added to the petition basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it  in featuring boys in the commercials  on the boxes  and most of all creating them in less gender specific colors. So this petition started to take off    humongously fast  you have no idea. I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets  and it was amazing. In three weeks  maybe three and a half  I had        signatures on this petition. Thank you. So  needless to say  it was crazy. Eventually  Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy Bake Oven product to me in black  silver and blue. It was literally one of the best moments of my life. It was like  quot Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. quot  That thing was amazing. What I didn't realize at the time  however  was that I had become an activist  I could change something  that even as a kid  or maybe  even especially as a kid  my voice mattered  and your voice matters too. I want to let you know it's not going to be easy  and it wasn't easy for me  because I faced a lot of obstacles. People online  and sometimes even in real life  were disrespectful to me and my family  and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time  and it really discouraged me. And actually  I have some examples  because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy  So  let's see. From user name Liquidsore      interesting user names we have here   quot Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay. quot  Liquidsore    really  Really  Okay. How about from Whiteboy  AGS   People always need something to  female dog  about.  From Jeffrey Gutierrez   quot OMG  shut up. You just want money and attention. quot  So it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought  people don't care  people think it's a waste of time  and people are going to be disrespectful  to me and my family. It hurt me  and it made me think  what's the point of making change in the future  But then I started to realize something. Haters gonna hate. Come on  say it with me. One  two  three  Haters gonna hate. So let your haters hate  you know what  and make your change  because I know you can. I look out into this crowd  and I see     people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change  and I know that you can  and all of you watching at home can too because you have so much that you  can do and that you believe in  and you can trade it across all these social media  through Facebook  through Twitter  through  YouTube  through Reddit  through Tumblr  through whatever else you can think of. And you can make that change. You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it. And that spark that you've been  hearing about all day today  you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire. Thank you. Science  science has allowed us to know so much about the far reaches of the universe  which is at the same time tremendously important and extremely remote  and yet much  much closer  much more directly related to us  there are many things we don't really understand. And one of them is the extraordinary social complexity of the animals around us  and today I want to tell you a few stories of animal complexity. But first  what do we call complexity  What is complex  Well  complex is not complicated. Something complicated comprises many small parts  all different  and each of them has its own precise role in the machinery. On the opposite  a complex system is made of many  many similar parts  and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior. Complex systems have many interacting parts which behave according to simple  individual rules  and this results in emergent properties. The behavior of the system as a whole cannot be predicted from the individual rules only. As Aristotle wrote  the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. But from Aristotle  let's move onto a more concrete example of complex systems. These are Scottish terriers. In the beginning  the system is disorganized. Then comes a perturbation  milk. Every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens. The pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction. So it's all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges. I call this simplifying complexity  and it's what we do at the chair of systems design at ETH Zurich. We collect data on animal populations  analyze complex patterns  try to explain them. It requires physicists who work with biologists  with mathematicians and computer scientists  and it is their interaction that produces cross boundary competence to solve these problems. So again  the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In a way  collaboration is another example of a complex system. And you may be asking yourself which side I'm on  biology or physics  In fact  it's a little different  and to explain  I need to tell you a short story about myself. When I was a child  I loved to build stuff  to create complicated machines. So I set out to study electrical engineering and robotics  and my end of studies project was about building a robot called ER      it looked like this  that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground. It was very  very complicated  but it worked beautifully in our test room  and on demo day  professors had  assembled to grade the project. So we took ER   to the evaluation room. It turned out  the light in that room was slightly different. The robot's vision system got confused. At the first bend in the line  it left its course  and crashed into a wall. We had spent weeks building it  and all it took to destroy it was a subtle change in the color of the light in the room. That's when I realized that the more complicated you make a machine  the more likely that it will fail due to something absolutely unexpected. And I decided that  in fact  I didn't really want to create complicated stuff. I wanted to understand complexity  the complexity of the world around us and especially in the animal kingdom. Which brings us to bats. Bechstein's bats are a common species of European bats. They are very social animals. Mostly they roost  or sleep  together. And they live in maternity colonies  which means that every spring  the females meet after the winter hibernation  and they stay together for about six months to rear their young  and they all carry a very small chip  which means that every time one of them enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes  we know where she is  and more importantly  we know with whom she is. So I study roosting associations in bats  and this is what it looks like. During the day  the bats roost in a number of sub groups in different boxes. It could be that on one day  the colony is split between two boxes  but on another day  it could be together in a single box  or split between three or more boxes  and that all seems rather erratic  really. It's called fission fusion dynamics  the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups. So what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony. Okay  So that's what this picture looks like. In this network  all the circles are nodes  individual bats  and the lines between them are social bonds  associations between individuals. It turns out this is a very interesting picture. This bat colony is organized in two different communities which cannot be predicted from the daily fission fusion dynamics. We call them cryptic social units. Even more interesting  in fact  Every year  around October  the colony splits up  and all bats hibernate separately  but year after year  when the bats come together again in the spring  the communities stay the same. So these bats remember their friends for a really long time. With a brain the size of a peanut  they maintain individualized  long term social bonds  We didn't know that was possible. We knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that  but compared to bats  they have huge brains. So how could it be that the bats maintain this complex  stable social structure with such limited cognitive abilities  And this is where complexity brings an answer. To understand this system  we built a computer model of roosting  based on simple  individual rules  and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony. It's a mathematical model  but it's not complicated. What the model told us is that  in a nutshell  each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends  and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them. Simple  individual rules. This is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats. But it gets better. Between      and       the colony lost more than two thirds of its members  probably due to the very cold winter. The next spring  it didn't form two communities like every year  which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small. Instead  it formed a single  cohesive social unit  which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years. What we know is that the bats are not aware that their colony is doing this. All they do is follow simple association rules  and from this simplicity emerges social complexity which allows the colony to be resilient against dramatic changes in the population structure. And I find this incredible. Now I want to tell you another story  but for this we have to travel from Europe to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa. This is where meerkats live. I'm sure you know meerkats. They're fascinating creatures. They live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy. There is one dominant pair  and many subordinates  some acting as sentinels  some acting as babysitters  some teaching pups  and so on. What we do is put very small GPS collars on these animals to study how they move together  and what this has to do with their social structure. And there's a very interesting example of collective movement in meerkats. In the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road. On this road there are cars  so it's dangerous. But the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to another. So we asked  how exactly do they do this  We found that the dominant female is mostly the one who leads the group to the road  but when it comes to crossing it  crossing the road  she gives way to the subordinates  a manner of saying   Go ahead  tell me if it's safe.  What I didn't know  in fact  was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it. So I built a model  a model of simulated meerkats crossing a simulated road. It's a simplistic model. Moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment. They simply move together. When these particles get to the road  they sense some kind of obstacle  and they bounce against it. The only difference between the dominant female  here in red  and the other individuals  is that for her  the height of the obstacle  which is in fact the risk perceived from the road  is just slightly higher  and this tiny difference in the individual's rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe  that the dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first. George Box  who was an English statistician  once wrote   All models are false  but some models are useful.  And in fact  this model is obviously false  because in reality  meerkats are anything but random particles. But it's also useful  because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group. So again  that's simplifying complexity. I would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species. When the dominant female gives way to a subordinate  it's not out of courtesy. In fact  the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group. If she dies on the road  the whole group is at risk. So this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response. These meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic that is thousands of generations old  and they're adapting it to a modern risk  in this case a road built by humans. They adapt very simple rules  and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat. In the end  it may be bats which change their social structure in response to a population crash  or it may be meerkats who show a novel adaptation to a human road  or it may be another species. My message here    and it's not a complicated one  but a simple one of wonder and hope    my message here is that animals show extraordinary social complexity  and this allows them to adapt and respond to changes in their environment. In three words  in the animal kingdom  simplicity leads to complexity which leads to resilience. Thank you. Dania Gerhardt  Thank you very much  Nicolas  for this great start. Little bit nervous  Nicolas Perony  I'm okay  thanks. DG  Okay  great. I'm sure a  lot of people in the audience somehow tried to make associations between the animals you were talking about    the bats  meerkats    and humans. You brought some examples  The females are the social ones  the females are the dominant ones  I'm not sure who thinks how. But is it okay to do these associations  Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard that can be valid across all species  NP  Well  I would say there are also counter examples to these stereotypes. For examples  in sea horses or in koalas  in fact  it is the males who take care of the young always. And the lesson is that it's often difficult  and sometimes even a bit dangerous  to draw parallels between humans and animals. So that's it. DG  Okay. Thank you very much for this great start.

Maya Penn  I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon  and I've been making animated flip books since I was three years old. At that age  I also learned about what an animator was. There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don't know about. When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV  I immediately said   That's what I want to be.  I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud  but that was a greatly defining moment in my life. Animation and art has always been my first love. It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for  Malicious Dishes.  There was a virus on my computer  and I was trying to get rid of it  and all of a sudden  I just thought  what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer  Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things  And thus   Malicious Dishes  was born. At four years old  my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again. That started my love for technology. I built my first website myself in HTML  and I'm learning JavaScript and Python. I'm also working on an animated series called  The Pollinators.  It's about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they're so important. If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators  then all creatures  including ourselves  that depend on these plants  would starve. So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team. Pollinator  Deforestsaurus  I should have known  I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators  Thank you.  Applause  All of my animations start with ideas  but what are ideas  Ideas can spark a movement. Ideas are opportunities and innovation. Ideas truly are what make the world go round. If it wasn't for ideas  we wouldn't be where we are now with technology  medicine  art  culture  and how we even live our lives. At eight years old  I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya's Ideas  and my nonprofit  Maya's Ideas for the Planet. And I make eco friendly clothing and accessories. I'm    now  and although I started my business in       my artistic journey started way before then. I was greatly influenced by art  and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did  even my business. I would find different fabrics around the house  and say   quot This could be a scarf or a hat  quot  and I had all these ideas for designs. I noticed when I wore my creations  people would stop me and say   Wow  that's really cute. Where can I get one   And I thought  I can start my own business. Now I didn't have any business plans at only eight years old. I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back. My mom taught me how to sew  and on my back porch  I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon  and I would write down the names and the price of each item. I started making more items like hats  scarves and bags. Soon  my items began selling all over the world  and I had customers in Denmark  Italy  Australia  Canada and more. Now  I had a lot to learn about my business  like branding and marketing  staying engaged with my customers  and seeing what sold the most and the least. Soon  my business really started to take off. Then one day  Forbes magazine  contacted me when I was    years old. They wanted to feature me and my company in their article. Now a lot of people ask me  why is your business eco friendly  I've had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little. My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment. I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet  so I started doing my own research  and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed  there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment. For example  the grinding of materials  or the dumping of dried powder materials. These actions can pollute the air  making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it. So when I started my business  I knew two things  All of my items had to be eco friendly  and    to    percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations. I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business  but also a sustainable future. I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow. We live in a big  diverse and beautiful world  and that makes me even more passionate to save it. But it's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world. It takes to get it through your hearts  because when you get it through your heart  that is when movements are sparked. That is when opportunities and innovation are created  and that is why ideas come to life. Thank you  and peace and blessings. Thank you.  Applause  Pat Mitchell  So  you heard Maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman. Where are they  Please  Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just    Ah  I want you to imagine what a breakthrough this was for women who were victims of violence in the     s. They would come into the emergency room with what the police would call  a lovers' quarrel   and I would see a woman who was beaten  I would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist and swollen eyes. And as activists  we would take our Polaroid camera  we would take her picture  we would wait    seconds  and we would give her the photograph. And she would then have the evidence she needed to go to court. We were making what was invisible visible. I've been doing this for    years. I've been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children. And for all those years  I've had an absolutely passionate and sometimes not popular belief that this violence is not inevitable  that it is learned  and if it's learned  it can be un learned  and it can be prevented. Why do I believe this  Because it's true. It is absolutely true. Between      and       domestic violence among adult women in the United States has gone down by    percent  and that is great news. Sixty four percent. Now  how did we get there  Our eyes were wide open. Thirty years ago  women were beaten  they were stalked  they were raped  and no one talked about it. There was no justice. And as an activist  that was not good enough. And so step one on this journey is we organized  and we created this extraordinary underground network of amazing women who opened shelters  and if they didn't open a shelter  they opened their home so that women and children could be safe. And you know what else we did  We had bake sales  we had car washes  and we did everything we could do to fundraise  and then at one point we said  you know  it's time that we went to the federal government and asked them to pay for these extraordinary services that are saving people's lives. Right   Applause  And so  step number two  we knew we needed to change the laws. And so we went to Washington  and we lobbied for the first piece of legislation. And I remember walking through the halls of the U.S. Capitol  and I was in my   s  and my life had purpose  and I couldn't imagine that anybody would ever challenge this important piece of legislation. I was probably    and naive. But I heard about a congressman who had a very  very different point of view. Do you know what he called this important piece of legislation  He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act. The Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act. Ladies and gentlemen  that was in      in the United States  and I wish I had Twitter. Ten years later  after lots of hard work  we finally passed the Violence Against Women Act  which is a life changing act that has saved so many lives.  Applause  Thank you. I was proud to be part of that work  and it changed the laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities. And you know what else it did  It collected data. And I have to tell you  I'm passionate about data. In fact  I am a data nerd. I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here. I am a data nerd  and the reason for that is I want to make sure that if we spend a dollar  that the program works  and if it doesn't work  we should change the plan. And I also want to say one other thing  We are not going to solve this problem by building more jails or by even building more shelters. It is about economic empowerment for women  it is about healing kids who are hurt  and it is about prevention with a capital P. And so  step number three on this journey  We know  if we're going to keep making this progress  we're going to have to turn up the volume  we're going to have to increase the visibility  and we're going to have to engage the public. And so knowing that  we went to the Advertising Council  and we asked them to help us build a public education campaign. And we looked around the world to Canada and Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa  and we took this knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence. Take a look at one of our spots. Woman  Well  I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago  and I put everything away  so  Man  What is this  Pizza. Woman  If you had just called me  I would have known  Man  Dinner  Dinner ready is a pizza  Woman  Honey  please don't be so loud. Please don't Let go of me  Man  Get in the kitchen  Woman  No  Help  Man  You want to see what hurts   Slaps woman  That's what hurts  That's what hurts   Breaking glass  Woman  Help me    Children have to sit by and watch. What's your excuse    Esta Soler  As we were in the process of releasing this campaign  O.J. Simpson was arrested for the murder of his wife and her friend. We learned that he had a long history of domestic violence. The media became fixated. The story of domestic violence went from the back page  but actually from the no page  to the front page. Our ads blanketed the airwaves  and women  for the first time  started to tell their stories. Movements are about moments  and we seized this moment. And let me just put this in context. Before       do you have any idea how many articles were in The New York Times on domestic violence  I'll tell you     . And in the     s  over      . We were obviously making a difference. But we were still missing a critical element. So  step four  We needed to engage men. We couldn't solve this problem with    percent of the population on the sidelines. And I already told you I'm a data nerd. National polling told us that men felt indicted and not invited into this conversation. So we wondered  how can we include men  How can we get men to talk about violence against women and girls  And a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said   You want men to talk about violence against women and girls. Men don't talk.  I apologize to the men in the audience. I know you do. But he said   Do you know what they do do  They do talk to their kids. They talk to their kids as parents  as coaches.  And that's what we did. We met men where they were at and we built a program. And then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach was talking to a room filled with male athletes and men from all walks of life. And he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving men the tools to have healthy relationships. And all of a sudden  he looked at the back of the room  and he saw his daughter  and he called out his daughter's name  Michaela  and he said   Michaela  come up here.  And she's nine years old  and she was kind of shy  and she got up there  and he said   Sit down next to me.  She sat right down next to him. He gave her this big hug  and he said   People ask me why I do this work. I do this work because I'm her dad  and I don't want anyone ever to hurt her.  And as a parent  I get it. I get it  knowing that there are so many sexual assaults on college campuses that are so widespread and so under reported. We've done a lot for adult women. We've got to do a better job for our kids. We just do. We have to.  Applause  We've come a long way since the days of the Polaroid. Technology has been our friend. The mobile phone is a global game changer for the empowerment of women  and Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube and all the social media helps us organize and tell our story in a powerful way. And so those of you in this audience who have helped build those applications and those platforms  as an organizer  I say  thank you very much. Really. I clap for you. I'm the daughter of a man who joined one club in his life  the Optimist Club. You can't make that one up. And it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my DNA. I have been doing this work for over    years  and I am convinced  now more than ever  in the capacity of human beings to change. I believe we can bend the arc of human history toward compassion and equality  and I also fundamentally believe and passionately believe that this violence does not have to be part of the human condition. And I ask you  stand with us as we create futures without violence for women and girls and men and boys everywhere. Thank you very much. Five years ago  I was a Ph.D. student living two lives. In one  I used NASA supercomputers to design next generation spacecraft  and in the other I was a data scientist looking for potential smugglers of sensitive nuclear technologies. As a data scientist  I did a lot of analyses  mostly of facilities  industrial facilities around the world. And I was always looking for a better canvas to tie these all together. And one day  I was thinking about how all data has a location  and I realized that the answer had been staring me in the face. Although I was a satellite engineer  I hadn't thought about using satellite imagery in my work. Now  like most of us  I'd been online  I'd see my house  so I thought  I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up some of these facilities. And what I found really surprised me. The pictures that I was finding were years out of date  and because of that  it had relatively little relevance to the work that I was doing today. But I was intrigued. I mean  satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff. There are millions and millions of sensors surrounding us today  but there's still so much we don't know on a daily basis. How much oil is stored in all of China  How much corn is being produced  How many ships are in all of our world's ports  Now  in theory  all of these questions could be answered by imagery  but not if it's old. And if this data was so valuable  then how come I couldn't get my hands on more recent pictures  So the story begins over    years ago with the launch of the first generation of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites. And today  there's a handful of the great  great grandchildren of these early Cold War machines which are now operated by private companies and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery that you and I see on a daily basis comes. During this period  launching things into space  just the rocket to get the satellite up there  has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each  and that's created tremendous pressure to launch things infrequently and to make sure that when you do  you cram as much functionality in there as possible. All of this has only made satellites bigger and bigger and bigger and more expensive  now nearly a billion  with a b  dollars per copy. Because they are so expensive  there aren't very many of them. Because there aren't very many of them  the pictures that we see on a daily basis tend to be old. I think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally  but in order to visualize just how sparsely our planet is collected  some friends and I put together a dataset of the    million pictures that have been gathered by these satellites between      and     . As you can see in blue  huge areas of our world are barely seen  less than once a year  and even the areas that are seen most frequently  those in red  are seen at best once a quarter. Now as aerospace engineering grad students  this chart cried out to us as a challenge. Why do these things have to be so expensive  Does a single satellite really have to cost the equivalent of three     jumbo jets  Wasn't there a way to build a smaller  simpler  new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging  I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites  but fortunately we had help. In the late     s  a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the price of putting things in space. This was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites. This dropped the cost of putting objects up there by over a factor of      and suddenly we could afford to experiment  to take a little bit of risk  and to realize a lot of innovation. And a new generation of engineers and scientists  mostly out of universities  began launching these very small  breadbox sized satellites called CubeSats. And these were built with electronics obtained from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin. Now it was using the lessons learned from these early missions that my friends and I began a series of sketches of our own satellite design. And I can't remember a specific day where we made a conscious decision that we were actually going to go out and build these things  but once we got that idea in our minds of the world as a dataset  of being able to capture millions of data points on a daily basis describing the global economy  of being able to unearth billions of connections between them that had never before been found  it just seemed boring to go work on anything else. And so we moved into a cramped  windowless office in Palo Alto  and began working to take our design from the drawing board into the lab. The first major question we had to tackle was just how big to build this thing. In space  size drives cost  and we had worked with these very small  breadbox sized satellites in school  but as we began to better understand the laws of physics  we found that the quality of pictures those satellites could take was very limited  because the laws of physics dictate that the best picture you can take through a telescope is a function of the diameter of that telescope  and these satellites had a very small  very constrained volume. And we found that the best picture we would have been able to get looked something like this. Although this was the low cost option  quite frankly it was just too blurry to see the things that make satellite imagery valuable. So about three or four weeks later  we met a group of engineers randomly who had worked on the first private imaging satellite ever developed  and they told us that back in the     s  the U.S. government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff    that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution  being able to see objects one meter in size  they had found that they could not just get very high quality images  but get a lot of them at an affordable price. From our own computer simulations  we quickly found that one meter really was the minimum viable product to be able to see the drivers of our global economy  for the first time  being able to count the ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks that move around our world on a daily basis  while conveniently still not being able to see individuals. We had found our compromise. We would have to build something larger than the original breadbox  now more like a mini fridge  but we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck. So now we had our constraint. The laws of physics dictated the absolute minimum sized telescope that we could build. What came next was making the rest of the satellite as small and as simple as possible  basically a flying telescope with four walls and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book that used less power than a     watt lightbulb. The big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope. Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner  similar to a Xerox machine  and as they traverse the Earth  they take pictures  scanning row by row by row to build the complete image. Now people use these because they get a lot of light  which means less of the noise you see in a low cost cell phone image. The problem with them is they require very sophisticated pointing. You have to stay focused on a    centimeter target from over     miles away while moving at more than seven kilometers a second  which requires an awesome degree of complexity. So instead  we turned to a new generation of video sensors  originally created for use in night vision goggles. Instead of taking a single  high quality image  we could take a videostream of individually noisier frames  but then we could recombine all of those frames together into very high quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground  at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system. And we applied this technique to many of the other systems on the satellite as well  and day by day  our design evolved from CAD to prototypes to production units. A few short weeks ago  we packed up SkySat    put our signatures on it  and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth. Today  it's sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks. And soon  we'll turn our attention to launching a constellation of    or more of these satellites and beginning to build the scalable analytics that will allow us to unearth the insights in the petabytes of data we will collect. So why do all of this  Why build these satellites  Well  it turns out imaging satellites have a unique ability to provide global transparency  and providing that transparency on a timely basis is simply an idea whose time has come. We see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier  and beyond economic data  unlocking the human story  moment by moment. For a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid  it just doesn't get much better than that. Thank you. The urban explosion of the last years of economic boom also produced dramatic marginalization  resulting in the explosion of slums in many parts of the world. This polarization of enclaves of mega wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered is really at the center of today's urban crisis. But I want to begin tonight by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic or environmental. It's particularly a cultural crisis  a crisis of the institutions unable to reimagine the stupid ways which we have been growing  unable to challenge the oil hungry  selfish urbanization that have perpetuated cities based on consumption  from southern California to New York to Dubai. So I just really want to share with you a reflection that the future of cities today depends less on buildings and  in fact  depends more on the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations  that the best ideas in the shaping of the city in the future will not come from enclaves of economic power and abundance  but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity from which an urgent imagination can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today. And let me illustrate what I mean by understanding or engaging sites of conflict as harboring creativity  as I briefly introduce you to the Tijuana San Diego border region  which has been the laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect. This is the wall  the border wall  that separates San Diego and Tijuana  Latin America and the United States  a physical emblem of exclusionary planning policies that have perpetuated the division of communities  jurisdictions and resources across the world. In this border region  we find some of the wealthiest real estate  as I once found in the edges of San Diego  barely    minutes away from some of the poorest  settlements in Latin America. And while these two cities have the same population  San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana in the last decades  immediately thrusting us to confront the tensions and conflicts between sprawl and density  which are at the center of today's discussion about environmental sustainability. So I've been arguing in the last years that  in fact  the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot to the sprawls of San Diego when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability  that we should pay attention and learn from the many migrant communities on both sides of this border wall so that we can translate their informal processes of urbanization. What do I mean by the informal in this case  I'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization. I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence of the bottom up  whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana that build themselves  in fact  with the waste of San Diego  or the many migrant neighborhoods in Southern California that have begun to be retrofitted with difference in the last decades. So I've been interested as an artist in the measuring  the observation  of many of the trans border informal flows across this border  in one direction  from south to north  the flow of immigrants into the United States  and from north to south the flow of waste from southern California into Tijuana. I'm referring to the recycling of these old post war bungalows that Mexican contractors bring to the border as American developers are disposing of them in the process of building a more inflated version of suburbia in the last decades. So these are houses waiting to cross the border. Not only people cross the border here  but entire chunks of one city move to the next  and when these houses are placed on top of these steel frames  they leave the first floor to become the second to be in filled with more house  with a small business. This layering of spaces and economies is very interesting to notice. But not only houses  also small debris from one city  from San Diego  to Tijuana. Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires that are used in the slums to build retaining walls. But look at what people have done here in conditions of socioeconomic emergency. They have figured out how to peel off the tire  how to thread it and interlock it to construct a more efficient retaining wall. Or the garage doors that are brought from San Diego in trucks to become the new skin of emergency housing in many of these slums surrounding the edges of Tijuana. So while  as an architect  this is a very compelling thing to witness  this creative intelligence  I also want to keep myself in check. I don't want to romanticize poverty. I just want to suggest that this informal urbanization is not just the image of precariousness  that informality here  the informal  is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures that we could translate as artists  that this is about a bottom up urbanization that performs. See here  buildings are not important just for their looks  but  in fact  they are important for what they can do. They truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources. So while waste flows southbound  people go north in search of dollars  and most of my research has had to do with the impact of immigration in the alteration of the homogeneity of many neighborhoods in the United States  particularly in San Diego. And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization    I mean  on steroids    with the small programs  social and economic. I'm referring to how immigrants  when they come to these neighborhoods  they begin to alter the one dimensionality of parcels and properties into more socially and economically complex systems  as they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage  or as they build an illegal granny flat to support an extended family. This socioeconomic entrepreneurship on the ground within these neighborhoods really begins to suggest ways of translating that into new  inclusive and more equitable land use policies. So many stories emerge from these dynamics of alteration of space  such as  quot the informal Buddha  quot  which tells the story of a small house that saved itself  it did not travel to Mexico  but it was retrofitted in the end into a Buddhist temple  and in so doing  this small house transforms or mutates from a singular dwelling into a small  or a micro  socioeconomic and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood. So these action neighborhoods  as I call them  really become the inspiration to imagine other interpretations of citizenship that have less to do  in fact  with belonging to the nation state  and more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city. As an artist  I've been interested  in fact  in the visualization of citizenship  the gathering of many anecdotes  urban stories  in order to narrativize the relationship between social processes and spaces. This is a story of a group of teenagers that one night  a few months ago  decided to invade this space under the freeway to begin constructing their own skateboard park. With shovels in hand  they started to dig. Two weeks later  the police stopped them. They barricaded the place  and the teenagers were evicted  and the teenagers decided to fight back  not with bank cards or slogans but with constructing a critical process. The first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political jurisdiction inscribed in that empty space. They found out that they had been lucky because they had not begun to dig under Caltrans territoy. Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway  so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them. They were lucky  they said  because they began to dig under an arm of the freeway that belongs to the local municipality. They were also lucky  they said  because they began to dig in a sort of Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction  between port authority  airport authority  two city districts  and a review board. All these red lines are the invisible political institutions that were inscribed in that leftover empty space. With this knowledge  these teenagers as skaters confronted the city. They came to the city attorney's office. The city attorney told them that in order to continue the negotiation they had to become an NGO  and of course they didn't know what an NGO was. They had to talk to their friends in Seattle who had gone through the same experience. And they began to realize the necessity to organize themselves even deeper and began to fundraise  to organize budgets  to really be aware of all the knowledge embedded in the urban code in San Diego so that they could begin to redefine the very meaning of public space in the city  expanding it to other categories. At the end  the teenagers won the case with that evidence  and they were able to construct their skateboard park under that freeway. Now for many of you  this story might seem trivial or naive. For me as an architect  it has become a fundamental narrative  because it begins to teach me that this micro community not only designed another category of public space but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols that were necessary to be inscribed in that space for its long term sustainability. They also taught me that similar to the migrant communities on both sides of the border  they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool  because they had to produce a process that enabled them to reorganize resources and the politics of the city. In that act  that informal  bottom up act of transgression  really began to trickle up to transform top down policy. Now this journey from the bottom up to the transformation of the top down is where I find hope today. And I'm thinking of how these modest alterations with space and with policy in many cities in the world  in primarily the urgency of a collective imagination as these communities reimagine their own forms of governance  social organization  and infrastructure  really is at the center of the new formation of democratic politics of the urban. It is  in fact  this that could become the framework for producing new social and economic justice in the city. I want to say this and emphasize it  because this is the only way I see that can enable us to move from urbanizations of consumption to neighborhoods of production today. Thank you. Intelligence    what is it  If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed  one seminal example has been Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that  the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim.  Now  Edsger Dijkstra  when he wrote this  intended it as a criticism of the early pioneers of computer science  like Alan Turing. However  if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that  fly   you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines. And so  several years ago  I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence. Let's take a step back. Let's first begin with a thought experiment. Pretend that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence  but you have amazing telescopes and you're able to watch the Earth  and you have amazingly long lives  so you're able to watch the Earth over millions  even billions of years. And you observe a really strange effect. You observe that  over the course of the millennia  Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point  and that at some point  corresponding roughly to our year       AD  asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth. Now of course  as earthlings  we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves. We're trying to prevent an impact. But if you're an alien race who doesn't know any of this  doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence  you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how  up until a certain point in time  asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that. And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence. So in this program that I undertook several years ago  I looked at a variety of different threads across science  across a variety of disciplines  that were pointing  I think  towards a single  underlying mechanism for intelligence. In cosmology  for example  there have been a variety of different threads of evidence that our universe appears to be finely tuned for the development of intelligence  and  in particular  for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible futures. In game play  for example  in Go    everyone remembers in      when IBM's Deep Blue beat  Garry Kasparov at chess    fewer people are aware that in the past    years or so  the game of Go  arguably a much more challenging game because it has a much higher branching factor  has also started to succumb to computer game players for the same reason  the best techniques right now for computers playing Go are techniques that try to maximize future options during game play. Finally  in robotic motion planning  there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tasks. And so  taking all of these different threads and putting them together  I asked  starting several years ago  is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads  Is there a single equation for intelligence  And the answer  I believe  is yes.   F   T   S    What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E   mc  for intelligence that I've seen. So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force  F  that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action. It acts to maximize future freedom of action  or keep options open  with some strength T  with the diversity of possible accessible futures  S  up to some future time horizon  tau. In short  intelligence doesn't like to get trapped. Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open. And so  given this one equation  it's natural to ask  so what can you do with this  How predictive is it  Does it predict human level intelligence  Does it predict artificial intelligence  So I'm going to show you now a video that will  I think  demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation. has suggested that universes that produce more disorder  or  entropy   over their lifetimes should tend to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves. But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship  What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate with the production of long term entropy  but actually emerges directly from it  To find out  we developed a software engine called Entropica  designed to maximize the production of long term entropy of any system that it finds itself in. Amazingly  Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests  play human games  and even earn money trading stocks  all without being instructed to do so. Here are some examples of Entropica in action. Just like a human standing upright without falling over  here we see Entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart. This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Entropica a goal. It simply decided on its own to balance the pole. This balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies. Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces  here we see that Entropica  again on its own initiative  was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk  representing a tool  to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position. This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture. In addition  just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food  here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish a model version of that task. This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields. Entropica is broadly applicable to a variety of domains. For example  here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself  illustrating its potential for gaming. Here we see Entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected. This same network orchestration ability also has applications in health care  energy  and intelligence. Here we see Entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships  successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific. By the same token  Entropica is broadly applicable to problems in autonomous defense  logistics and transportation. Finally  here we see Entropica spontaneously discovering and executing a buy low  sell high strategy on a simulated range traded stock  successfully growing assets under management exponentially. This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance. Alex Wissner Gross  So what you've just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright and social cooperation all follow from a single equation  which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action. Now  there's a profound irony here. Going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot  the play  RUR   there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence  there would be a cybernetic revolt. The machines would rise up against us. One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades  we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse. It's not that machines first become intelligent and then megalomaniacal and try to take over the world. It's quite the opposite  that the urge to take control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence  that general intelligence may in fact emerge directly from this sort of control grabbing  rather than vice versa. Another important consequence is goal seeking. I'm often asked  how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of framework  And the answer is  the ability to seek goals will follow directly from this in the following sense  just like you would travel through a tunnel  a bottleneck in your future path space  in order to achieve many other diverse objectives later on  or just like you would invest in a financial security  reducing your short term liquidity in order to increase your wealth over the long term  goal seeking emerges directly from a long term drive to increase future freedom of action. Finally  Richard Feynman  famous physicist  once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization  that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart but repel each other when they're close together. My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence  is the following  Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future. Thank you very much. Hi. So today  I'd like to share some works in progress. Since we are still realizing these works  we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery  still. So I'm going to try and describe some of the experiences that we're looking for through each of the works. So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes. A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room  and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall. Within seconds  as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer  they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry. So this is the sketch of the two states. One is total chaos. The other is absolute order. And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state. This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions. One is the altar tablets of the   th century  and the other is about     years ago  Malevich's abstract compositions. So I'm just going to take you to a video. To give you a sense of scale  the largest panel is about two meters high. That's about this much.  And the smallest one is an A . So a viewer enters the space  and they snap to attention. And after a while  if the viewer continues to remain in the space  the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again  until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement  when they will again snap to attention. So here it appears as if it's the viewer that's sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels  but it could also be the other way around  that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant. So this brings me to a quieter  small work called Handheld. The viewer sees a piece of paper that's mounted on the far end of the wall  but when you go closer  you see that it's a blank A   or a letter sized piece of paper  that's held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood. The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly  as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time  and somehow are not managing to. So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera. So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips. One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera. And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view. So we've just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel. So here's a video. You have to imagine the other hand. It's not there yet. But to us  we're sort of trying to evoke a self effacing gesture  as if there's a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper. That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them. The next work is Decoy. This is a cardboard model  so the object is about as tall as I am. It has a rounded body  two arms  and a very tall  head like antenna  and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself. So when a viewer passes by  it sort of tilts from side to side  and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer. So here is the first test scenario. You see the two movements integrated  and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation. But the idea is that once it's got the person's attention  it's no longer interested  and it looks for the next person whose attention to get. So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy. It appears to be mass manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines. Because we are always working from a very personal space  we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance  at least. And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention  but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help. The next work is an object  that's also a kind of sound instrument. In the shape of an amphitheater that's scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage. So from where I'm standing  each of you appears to be this big  and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision. Seated in this audience are     small figures. They're mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will. This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap  how hard  for how long  how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others  and if they want to contribute to innovation. So when the viewer steps in front of the audience  there will be a response. It could be a few claps or a strong applause  and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage  and again the audience will respond. It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience  or it could be a very loud ovation. So to us  I think we're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that's also got a sort of musical like quality to it  an instrument. So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied  nuanced musical or sound patterns  but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response. So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved. It also has an alluring and trap like quality to it. So here if you see we're quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands. So here's a small visual animation  as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension. And here is a prototype. So we can't wait to be engulfed by     of them. Okay  this is the last work. It's called the Framerunners. It comes out of the idea of a window. This is an actual window in our studio  and as you can see  it's made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections. So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that's suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides. This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures. They're also made up of three different sizes  as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain. Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks. So in contrast to this very tight grid  we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick like quality  as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path. So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they're oblivious and carefree and happy go lucky and content  until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall. So to us  this work also presents its own contradiction. These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid  which is like a prison  but also a fortress  because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world. So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration  and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype. So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head bobbing movement and the back and forth movement. So it's really quite small. You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand. So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio  and here it is. Thank you. I'd like to start  if I may  with the story of the Paisley snail. On the evening of the   th of August        May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow to the town of Paisley  seven miles east of the city  and there at the Wellmeadow Caf   she had a Scots ice cream float  a mix of ice cream and ginger beer bought for her by a friend. The ginger beer came in a brown  opaque bottle labeled  D. Stevenson  Glen Lane  Paisley.  She drank some of the ice cream float  but as the remaining ginger beer was poured into her tumbler  a decomposed snail floated to the surface of her glass. Three days later  she was admitted to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock. The case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followed set a very important legal precedent  Stevenson  the manufacturer of the ginger beer  was held to have a clear duty of care towards May Donoghue  even though there was no contract between them  and  indeed  she hadn't even bought the drink. One of the judges  Lord Atkin  described it like this  You must take care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbor. Indeed  one wonders that without a duty of care  how many people would have had to suffer from gastroenteritis before Stevenson eventually went out of business. Now please hang on to that Paisley snail story  because it's an important principle. Last year  the Hansard Society  a nonpartisan charity which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy and encourage greater public involvement in politics published  alongside their annual audit of political engagement  an additional section devoted entirely to politics and the media. Here are a couple of rather depressing observations from that survey. Tabloid newspapers do not appear to advance the political citizenship of their readers  relative even to those who read no newspapers whatsoever. Tabloid only readers are twice as likely to agree with a negative view of politics than readers of no newspapers. They're not just less politically engaged. They are consuming media that reinforces their negative evaluation of politics  thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical attitude to democracy and their own role within it. Little wonder that the report concluded that in this respect  the press  particularly the tabloids  appear not to be living up to the importance of their role in our democracy. Now I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously challenge that view. But if Hansard are right  and they usually are  then we've got a very serious problem on our hands  and it's one that I'd like to spend the next    minutes focusing upon. Since the Paisley snail  and especially over the past decade or so  a great deal of thinking has been developed around the notion of a duty of care as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society. Generally a duty of care arises when one individual or a group of individuals undertakes an activity which has the potential to cause harm to another  either physically  mentally or economically. This is principally focused on obvious areas  such as our empathetic response to children and young people  to our service personnel  and to the elderly and infirm. It is seldom  if ever  extended to equally important arguments around the fragility of our present system of government  to the notion that honesty  accuracy and impartiality are fundamental to the process of building and embedding an informed  participatory democracy. And the more you think about it  the stranger that is. A couple of years ago  I had the pleasure of opening a brand new school in the northeast of England. It had been renamed by its pupils as Academy    . As I walked through their impressive  glass covered atrium  in front of me  emblazoned on the wall in letters of fire was Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction  If it's not true  don't say it  if it's not right  don't do it. The head teacher saw me staring at it  and he said   Oh  that's our school motto.  On the train back to London  I couldn't get it out of my mind. I kept thinking  can it really have taken us over       years to come to terms with that simple notion as being our minimum expectation of each other  Isn't it time that we develop this concept of a duty of care and extended it to include a care for our shared but increasingly endangered democratic values  After all  the absence of a duty of care within many professions can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence  and that being the case  can we be really comfortable with the thought that we're in effect being negligent in respect of the health of our own societies and the values that necessarily underpin them  Could anyone honestly suggest  on the evidence  that the same media which Hansard so roundly condemned have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving in ways which they could reasonably have foreseen would be likely to undermine or even damage our inherently fragile democratic settlement. Now there will be those who will argue that this could all too easily drift into a form of censorship  albeit self censorship  but I don't buy that argument. It has to be possible to balance freedom of expression with wider moral and social responsibilities. Let me explain why by taking the example from my own career as a filmmaker. Throughout that career  I never accepted that a filmmaker should set about putting their own work outside or above what he or she believed to be a decent set of values for their own life  their own family  and the future of the society in which we all live. I'd go further. A responsible filmmaker should never devalue their work to a point at which it becomes less than true to the world they themselves wish to inhabit. As I see it  filmmakers  journalists  even bloggers are all required to face up to the social expectations that come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium with their well honed professional skills. Obviously this is not a mandated duty  but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger  it strikes me as being utterly inescapable. We should always remember that our notion of individual freedom and its partner  creative freedom  is comparatively new in the history of Western ideas  and for that reason  it's often undervalued and can be very quickly undermined. It's a prize easily lost  and once lost  once surrendered  it can prove very  very hard to reclaim. And its first line of defense has to be our own standards  not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation  our own standards and our own integrity. Our integrity as we deal with those with whom we work and our own standards as we operate within society. And these standards of ours need to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda. They're part of a collective responsibility  the responsibility of the artist or the journalist to deal with the world as it really is  and this  in turn  must go hand in hand with the responsibility of those governing society to also face up to that world  and not to be tempted to misappropriate the causes of its ills. Yet  as has become strikingly clear over the last couple of years  such responsibility has to a very great extent been abrogated by large sections of the media. And as a consequence  across the Western world  the over simplistic policies of the parties of protest and their appeal to a largely disillusioned  older demographic  along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial that typifies at least some of the young  taken together  these and other similarly contemporary aberrations are threatening to squeeze the life out of active  informed debate and engagement  and I stress active. The most ardent of libertarians might argue that Donoghue v. Stevenson should have been thrown out of court and that Stevenson would eventually have gone out of business if he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it. But most of us  I think  accept some small role for the state to enforce a duty of care  and the key word here is reasonable. Judges must ask  did they take reasonable care and could they have reasonably foreseen the consequences of their actions  Far from signifying overbearing state power  it's that small common sense test of reasonableness that I'd like us to apply to those in the media who  after all  set the tone and the content for much of our democratic discourse. Democracy  in order to work  requires that reasonable men and women take the time to understand and debate difficult  sometimes complex issues  and they do so in an atmosphere which strives for the type of understanding that leads to  if not agreement  then at least a productive and workable compromise. Politics is about choices  and within those choices  politics is about priorities. It's about reconciling conflicting preferences wherever and whenever possibly based on fact. But if the facts themselves are distorted  the resolutions are likely only to create further conflict  with all the stresses and strains on society that inevitably follow. The media have to decide  Do they see their role as being to inflame or to inform  Because in the end  it comes down to a combination of trust and leadership. Fifty years ago this week  President John F. Kennedy made two epoch making speeches  the first on disarmament and the second on civil rights. The first led almost immediately to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty  and the second led to the      Civil Rights Act  both of which represented giant leaps forward. Democracy  well led and well informed  can achieve very great things  but there's a precondition. We have to trust that those making those decisions are acting in the best interest not of themselves but of the whole of the people. We need factually based options  clearly laid out  not those of a few powerful and potentially manipulative corporations pursuing their own frequently narrow agendas  but accurate  unprejudiced information with which to make our own judgments. If we want to provide decent  fulfilling lives for our children and our children's children  we need to exercise to the very greatest degree possible that duty of care for a vibrant  and hopefully a lasting  democracy. Thank you very much for listening to me. So imagine  you're in the supermarket  you're buying some groceries  and you get given the option for a plastic or a paper shopping bag. Which one do you choose if you want to do the right thing by the environment  Most people do pick the paper. Okay  let's think of why. It's brown to start with. Therefore  it must be good for the environment. It's biodegradable. It's reusable. In some cases  it's recyclable. So when people are looking at the plastic bag  it's likely they're thinking of something like this  which we all know is absolutely terrible  and we should be avoiding at all expenses these kinds of environmental damages. But people are often not thinking of something like this  which is the other end of the spectrum. When we produce materials  we need to extract them from the environment  and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts. You see  what happens is  when we need to make complex choices  us humans like really simple solutions  and so we often ask for simple solutions. And I work in design. I advise designers and innovators around sustainability  and everyone always says to me   Oh Leyla  I just want the eco materials.  And I say   Well  that's very complex  and we'll have to spend four hours talking about what exactly an eco material means  because everything at some point comes from nature  and it's how you use the material that dictates the environmental impact. So what happens is  we have to rely on some sort of intuitive framework when we make decisions. So I like to call that intuitive framework our environmental folklore. It's either the little voice at the back of your head  or it's that gut feeling you get when you've done the right thing  so when you've picked the paper bag or when you've bought a fuel efficient car. And environmental folklore is a really important thing because we're trying to do the right thing. But how do we know if we're actually reducing the net environmental impacts that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment  So the thing about environmental folklore is it tends to be based on our experiences  the things we've heard from other people. It doesn't tend to be based on any scientific framework. And this is really hard  because we live in incredibly complex systems. We have the human systems of how we communicate and interrelate and have our whole constructed society  We have the industrial systems  which is essentially the entire economy  and then all of that has to operate within the biggest system  and  I would argue  the most important  the ecosystem. And you see  the choices that we make as an individual  but the choices that we make in every single job that we have  no matter how high or low you are in the pecking order  has an impact on all of these systems. And the thing is that we have to find ways if we're actually going to address sustainability of interlocking those complex systems and making better choices that result in net environmental gains. What we need to do is we need to learn to do more with less. We have an increasing population  and everybody likes their mobile phones  especially in this situation here. So we need to find innovative ways of solving some of these problems that we face. And that's where this process called life cycle thinking comes in. So essentially  everything that is created goes through a series of life cycle stages  and we use this scientific process called life cycle assessment  or in America  you guys say life cycle analysis  in order to have a clearer picture of how everything that we do in the technical part of those systems affects the natural environment. So we go all the way back to the extraction of raw materials  and then we look at manufacturing  we look at packaging and transportation  use  and end of life  and at every single one of these stages  the things that we do have an interaction with the natural environment  and we can monitor how that interaction is actually affecting the systems and services that make life on Earth possible. And through doing this  we've learned some absolutely fascinating things. And we've busted a bunch of myths. So to start with  there's a word that's used a lot. It's used a lot in marketing  and it's used a lot  I think  in our conversation when we're talking about sustainability  and that's the word biodegradability. Now biodegradability is a material property  it is not a definition of environmental benefits. Allow me to explain. When something natural  something that's made from a cellulose fiber like a piece of bread  even  or any food waste  or even a piece of paper  when something natural ends up in the natural environment  it degrades normally. Its little carbon molecules that it stored up as it was growing are naturally released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide  but this is a net situation. Most natural things don't actually end up in nature. Most of the things  the waste that  we produce  end up in landfill. Landfill is a different environment. In landfill  those same carbon molecules degrade in a different way  because a landfill is anaerobic. It's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot. Those same molecules  they become methane  and methane is a    times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. So our old lettuces and products that we have thrown out that are made out of biodegradable materials  if they end up in landfill  contribute to climate change. You see  there are facilities now that can actually capture that methane and generate power  displacing the need for fossil fuel power  but we need to be smart about this. We need to identify how we can start to leverage these types of things that are already happening and start to design systems and services that alleviate these problems. Because right now  what people do is they turn around and they say   Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper because that is better for the environment.  But if you're throwing it in the bin  and your local landfill facility is just a normal one  then we're having what's called a double negative. I'm a product designer by trade. I then did social science. And so I'm absolutely fascinated by consumer goods and how the consumer goods that we have kind of become immune to that fill our lives have an impact on the natural environment. And these guys are  like  serial offenders  and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room has a refrigerator. Now America has this amazing ability to keep growing refrigerators. In the last few years  they've grown one cubic foot on average  the standard size of a refrigerator. And the problem is  they're so big now  it's easier for us to buy more food that we can't eat or find. I mean  I have things at the back of my refrigerator that have been there for years  all right  And so what happens is  we waste more food. And as I was just explaining  food waste is a problem. In fact  here in the U.S.     percent of food purchased for the home is wasted. Half of the world's produced food is wasted. That's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food. It's insane. It's  .  billion tons of food per annum. And I blame it on the refrigerator  well  especially in Western cultures  because it makes it easier. I mean  there's a lot of complex systems going on here. I don't want to make it so simplistic. But the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this  and one of the features of it is the crisper drawer. You all got crisper drawers  The drawer that you put your lettuces in  Lettuces have a habit of going soggy in the crisper drawers  don't they  Yeah  Soggy lettuces  In the U.K.  this is such a problem that there was a government report a few years ago that actually said the second biggest offender of wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce. It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report. Okay  So this is a problem  people. These poor little lettuces are getting thrown out left  right and center because the crisper drawers are not designed to actually keep things crisp. Okay. You need a tight environment. You need  like  an airless environment to prevent the degrading that would happen naturally. But the crisper drawers  they're just a drawer with a slightly better seal. Anyway  I'm clearly obsessed. Don't ever invite me over because I'll just start going through your refrigerator and looking at all sorts of things like that. But essentially  this is a big problem. Because when we lose something like the lettuce from the system  not only do we have that impact  I just explained at the end of life  but we actually have had to grow that lettuce. The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical. We've had to clear land. We've had to plant seeds  phosphorus  fertilizers  nutrients  water  sunlight. All of the embodied impacts in that lettuce get lost from the system  which makes it a far bigger environmental impact than the loss of the energy from the fridge. So we need to design things like this far better if we're going to start addressing serious environmental problems. We could start with the crisper drawer and the size. For those of you in the room who do design fridges  that would be great. The problem is  imagine if we actually started to reconsider  how we designed things. So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity  but we actually haven't really changed the design of them that much since the     s. A little bit  but essentially they're still big boxes  cold boxes that we store stuff in. So imagine if we actually really started to identify these problems and use that as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant design solutions that will solve those problems. This is design led system change  design dictating the way in which the system can be far more sustainable. Forty percent food waste is a major problem. Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that. Another item that I find fascinating is the electric tea kettle  which I found out that you don't do tea kettles in this country  really  do you  But that's really big in the U.K. Ninety seven percent of households in the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle. So they're very popular. And  I mean  if I were to work with a design firm or a designer  and they were designing one of these  and they wanted to do it eco  they'd usually ask me two things. They'd say   Leyla  how do I make it technically efficient   Because obviously energy's a problem with this product. Or   How do I make it green materials  How do I make the materials green in the manufacturing   Would you ask me those questions  They seem logical  right  Yeah. Well I'd say   You're looking at the wrong problems.  Because the problem is with use. It's with how people use the product. Sixty five percent of Brits admit to over filling their kettle when they only need one cup of tea. All of this extra water that's being boiled requires energy  and it's been calculated that in one day of extra energy use from boiling kettles is enough to light all of the streetlights in England for a night. But this is the thing. This is what I call a product person failure. But we've got a product system failure going on with these little guys  and they're so ubiquitous  you  don't even notice they're there. And this guy over here  though  he does. He's named Simon. Simon works for the national electricity company in the U.K. He has a very important job of monitoring all of the electricity coming into the system to make sure there is enough so it powers everybody's homes. He's also watching television. The reason is because there's a unique phenomenon that happens in the U.K. the moment that very popular TV shows end. The minute the ad break comes on  this man has to rush to buy nuclear power from France  because everybody turns their kettles on at the same time.  .  million kettles  seriously problematic. So imagine if you designed kettles  you actually found a way to solve these system failures  because this is a huge amount of pressure on the system  just because the product hasn't thought about the problem that it's going to have when it exists in the world. Now  I looked at a number of kettles available on the market  and found the minimum fill lines  so the little piece of information that tells you how much you need to put in there  was between two and a five and a half cups of water just to make one cup of tea. So this kettle here is an example of one where it actually has two reservoirs. One's a boiling chamber  and one's the water holder. The user actually has to push that button to get their hot water boiled  which means  because we're all lazy  you only fill exactly what you need. And this is what I call behavior changing products  products  systems or services that intervene and solve these problems up front. Now  this is a technology arena  so obviously these things are quite popular  but I think if we're going to keep designing  buying and using and throwing out these kinds of products at the rate we currently do  which is astronomically high  there are seven billion people who live in the world right now. There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions as of last year. Every single year   .  billion mobile phones roll off production lines  and some companies report their production rate as being greater than the human birth rate. One hundred fifty two million phones  were thrown out in the U.S. last year  only    percent were recycled. I'm from Australia. We have a population of    million    don't laugh    and it's been reported that    million phones are in people's drawers. We need to find ways of solving the problems around this  because these things are so complicated. They have so much locked up inside them. Gold  Did you know that it's actually cheaper now to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones than it is out of a ton of gold ore  There's a number of highly complex and valuable materials embodied inside these things  so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly  because this is otherwise what happens. This is a community in Ghana  and e waste is reported  or electronic waste is reported by the U.N. as being up to    million tons trafficked. This is how they get the gold and the other valuable materials out. They burn the electronic waste in open spaces. These are communities  and this is happening all over the world. And because we don't see the ramifications of the choices that we make as designers  as businesspeople  as consumers  then these kinds of externalities happen  and these are people's lives. So we need to find smarter  more systems based  innovative solutions to these problems  if we're going to start to live sustainably within this world. So imagine if  when you bought your mobile phone  your new one because you replaced your old one    after    to    months is the average time that people replace their phones  by the way   so if we're going to keep this kind of expedient mobile phone replacing  then we should be looking at closing the loop on these systems. The people who produce these phones  and some of which I'm sure are in the room right now  could potentially look at doing what we call closed loop systems  or product system services  so identifying that there is a market demand and that market demand's not going to go anywhere  so you design the product to solve the problem. Design for disassembly  design for light weighting. We heard some of those kinds of strategies being used in the Tesla Motors car today. These kinds of approaches are not hard  but understanding the system and then looking for viable  market driven consumer demand alternatives is how we can start radically altering the sustainability agenda  because I hate to break it to you all  Consumption is the biggest problem. But design is one of the best solutions. These kinds of products are everywhere. By identifying alternative ways of doing things  we can actually start to innovate  and I say actually start to innovate. I'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative. But in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter  as a criteria for fueling systems based solutions  because as I've just demonstrated with these simple products  they're participating in these major problems. So we need to look across the entire life of the things that we do. If you just had paper or plastic    obviously reusable is far more beneficial    then the paper is worse  and the paper is worse because it weighs four to    times more than the plastic  and when we actually compare  from a life cycle perspective  a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper  the paper is far better  but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag to carry your groceries home is not  done with a kilo of each material. It's done with a very small amount of plastic and quite a lot more paper. Because functionality defines environmental impact  and I said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco materials. I say  there's only a few materials that you should completely avoid. The rest of them  it's all about application  and at the end of the day  everything we design and produce in the economy or buy as consumers is done so for function. We want something  therefore we buy it. So breaking things back down and delivering smartly  elegantly  sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing  everything  all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life  we can start to actually find really innovative solutions. And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently  who I work with  a senior designer. I said   How come you're not doing  sustainability  I know you know this.  And he said   Well  recently I pitched a sustainability project to a client  and turned and he said to me  'I know it's going to cost less  I know it's going to sell more  but we're not pioneers  because pioneers have arrows in their backs.'  I think we've got a roomful of pioneers  and I hope there are far more pioneers out there  because we need to solve these problems. Thank you. The world is changing in some really profound ways  and I worry that investors aren't paying enough attention to some of the biggest drivers of change  especially when it comes to sustainability. And by sustainability  I mean the really juicy things  like environmental and social issues and corporate governance. I think it's reckless to ignore these things  because doing so can jeopardize future long term returns. And here's something that may surprise you  the balance of power to really influence sustainability rests with institutional investors  the large investors like pension funds  foundations and endowments. I believe that sustainable investing is less complicated than you think  better performing than you believe  and more important than we can imagine. Let me remind you what we already know. We have a population that's both growing and aging  we have seven billion souls today heading to    billion at the end of the century  we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished  and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change just keep increasing. Now clearly  these are environmental and social issues  but that's not all. They're economic issues  and that makes them relevant to risk and return. And they are really complex and they can seem really far off  that the temptation may be to do this  bury our heads in the sand and not think about it. Resist this  if you can. Don't do this at home. But it makes me wonder if the investment rules of today are fit for purpose tomorrow. We know that investors  when they look at a company and decide whether to invest  they look at financial data  metrics like sales growth  cash flow  market share  valuation    you know  the really sexy stuff. And these things are fundamental  of course  but they're not enough. Investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call ESG  environment  social and governance. Environment includes energy consumption  water availability  waste and pollution  just making efficient uses of resources. Social includes human capital  things like employee engagement and innovation capacity  as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights. And governance relates to the oversight of companies by their boards and investors. See  I told you this is the really juicy stuff. But ESG is the measure of sustainability  and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors with financial factors into the investment process. It means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet  and it means providing capital to users who deploy it towards productive and sustainable outcomes. So if sustainability matters financially today  and all signs indicate more tomorrow  is the private sector paying attention  Well  the really cool thing is that most CEOs are. They started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success. About    percent of global CEOs see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation and leading to competitive advantage in their industries. But    percent see ESG as the future  or as important to the future of their business. So the views of CEOs are clear. There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability. So how are companies actually leveraging ESG to drive hard business results  One example is near and dear to our hearts. In       State Street migrated    applications to the cloud environment  and we retired another   . We virtualized our operating system environments  and we completed numerous automation projects. Now these initiatives create a more mobile workplace  and they reduce our real estate footprint  and they yield savings of    million dollars in operating costs annually  and avoid the emissions of a         metric tons of carbon. That's the equivalent of taking        cars off the road. So awesome  right  Another example is Pentair. Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate  and about a decade ago  they sold their core power tools business and reinvested those proceeds in a water business. That's a really big bet. Why did they do that  Well  with apologies to the Home Improvement fans  there's more growth in water than in power tools  and this company has their sights set on what they call  the new New World.  That's four billion middle class people demanding food  energy and water. Now  you may be asking yourself  are these just isolated cases  I mean  come on  really  Do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially  The answer that may surprise you is yes. The data shows that stocks with better ESG performance perform just as well as others. In blue  we see the MSCI World. It's an index of large companies from developed markets across the world. And in gold  we see a subset of companies rated as having the best ESG performance. Over three plus years  no performance tradeoff. So that's okay  right  We want more. I want more. In some cases  there may be outperformance from ESG. In blue  we see the performance of the     largest global companies  and in gold  we see a subset of companies with best practice in climate change strategy and risk management. Now over almost eight years  they've outperformed by about two thirds. So yes  this is correlation. It's not causation. But it does illustrate that environmental leadership is compatible with good returns. So if the returns are the same or better and the planet benefits  wouldn't this be the norm  Are investors  particularly institutional investors  engaged  Well  some are  and a few are really at the vanguard. Hesta. Hesta is a retirement fund for health and community services employees in Australia  with assets of    billion  dollars . They believe that ESG has the potential to impact risks and returns  so incorporating it into the investment process is core to their duty to act in the best interest of fund members  core to their duty. You gotta love the Aussies  right  CalPERS is another example. CalPERS is the pension fund for public employees in California  and with assets of     billion  dollars   they are the second largest in the U.S. and the sixth largest in the world. Now  they're moving toward     percent sustainable investment by systematically integrated ESG across the entire fund. Why  They believe it's critical to superior long term returns  full stop. In their own words   long term value creation requires the effective management of three forms of capital  financial  human  and physical. This is why we are concerned with ESG.  Now  I do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job  and not all of them see it this way. Often I hear   We are required to maximize returns  so we don't do that here   or   We don't want to use the portfolio to make policy statements.  The one that just really gets under my skin is   If you want to do something about that  just make money  give the profits to charities.  It's eyes rolling  eyes rolling. I mean  let me clarify something right here. Companies and investors are not singularly responsible for the fate of the planet. They don't have indefinite social obligations  and prudent investing and finance theory aren't subordinate to sustainability. They're compatible. So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here. But institutional investors are the x factor in sustainability. Why do they hold the key  The answer  quite simply  is  they have the money. A lot of it. I mean  a really lot of it. The global stock market is worth    trillion dollars. The global bond market     trillion. That's     trillion combined. That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S. That's the world's largest economy. That's some serious freaking firepower. So we can reconsider some of these pressing challenges  like fresh water  clean air  feeding    billion mouths  if institutional investors integrated ESG into investment. What if they used that firepower to allocate more of their capital to companies working the hardest at solving these challenges or at least not exacerbating them  What if we work and save and invest  only to find that the world we retire into is more stressed and less secure than it is now  What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water  Now a fair question might be  what if all this sustainability risk stuff is exaggerated  overstated  it's not urgent  something for virtuous consumers or lifestyle choice  Well  President John F. Kennedy said something about this that is just spot on   There are risks and costs to a program of action  but they are far less than the long range risks and costs of comfortable inaction.  I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this  but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus  the odds that it's not completely wrong are better than the odds that our house will burn down or we'll get in a car accident. Well  maybe not if you live in Boston.  Laughter  But my point is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially in case those things happen  right  So by investing sustainably we're doing two things. We're creating insurance  reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy  and at the same time  in the short term  we're not sacrificing performance.  Man in comic   What if it's a big hoax  and we create a better world for nothing    Good  you like it. I like it too. I like it because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue. I bet you can't guess which side I'm on. But what I really like about it is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said  which is   Plan for the future  because that's where you're going to spend the rest of your life.  Thank you. I'd like to talk today about a powerful and fundamental aspect of who we are  our voice. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint that reflects our age  our size  even our lifestyle and personality. In the words of the poet Longfellow   the human voice is the organ of the soul.  As a speech scientist  I'm fascinated by how the voice is produced  and I have an idea for how it can be engineered. That's what I'd like to share with you. I'm going to start by playing you a sample of a voice that you may recognize. it was fairly obvious what I meant.  Rupal Patel  That was the voice of Professor Stephen Hawking. What you may not know is that same voice may also be used by this little girl who is unable to speak because of a neurological condition. In fact  all of these individuals may be using the same voice  and that's because there's only a few options available. In the U.S. alone  there are  .  million Americans who are unable to speak  and many of whom use computerized devices to communicate. Now that's millions of people worldwide who are using generic voices  including Professor Hawking  who uses an American accented voice. This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when I was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago  and I recall walking into an exhibit hall and seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices  different devices  but the same voice. And I looked around and I saw this happening all around me  literally hundreds of individuals using a handful of voices  voices that didn't fit their bodies or their personalities. We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl with the prosthetic limb of a grown man. So why then the same prosthetic voice  It really struck me  and I wanted to do something about this. I'm going to play you now a sample of someone who has  two people actually  who have severe speech disorders. I want you to take a listen to how they sound. They're saying the same utterance. You probably didn't understand what they said  but I hope that you heard their unique vocal identities. So what I wanted to do next is  I wanted to find out how we could harness these residual vocal abilities and build a technology that could be customized for them  voices that could be customized for them. So I reached out to my collaborator  Tim Bunnell. Dr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis  and what he'd been doing is building personalized voices for people by putting together pre recorded samples of their voice and reconstructing a voice for them. These are people who had lost their voice later in life. We didn't have the luxury of pre recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder. But I thought  there had to be a way to reverse engineer a voice from whatever little is left over. So we decided to do exactly that. We set out with a little bit of funding from the National Science Foundation  to create custom crafted voices that captured their unique vocal identities. We call this project VocaliD  or vocal I.D.  for vocal identity. Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it  I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson. Okay  So first  we know that the voice is changing dramatically over the course of development. Children sound different from teens who sound different from adults. We've all experienced this. Fact number two is that speech is a combination of the source  which is the vibrations generated by your voice box  which are then pushed through the rest of the vocal tract. These are the chambers of your head and neck that vibrate  and they actually filter that source sound to produce consonants and vowels. So the combination of source and filter is how we produce speech. And that happens in one individual. Now I told you earlier that I'd spent a good part of my career understanding and studying the source characteristics of people with severe speech disorder  and what I've found is that even though their filters were impaired  they were able to modulate their source  the pitch  the loudness  the tempo of their voice. These are called prosody  and I've been documenting for years that the prosodic abilities of these individuals are preserved. So when I realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity  I had this idea. Why don't we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like  because it's preserved  and borrow the filter from someone about the same age and size  because they can articulate speech  and then mix them  Because when we mix them  we can get a voice that's as clear as our surrogate talker    that's the person we borrowed the filter from  and is similar in identity to our target talker. It's that simple. That's the science behind what we're doing. So once you have that in mind  how do you go about building this voice  Well  you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate. It's not such an ominous thing. Being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances. The process goes something like this. I love to sleep. The sky is blue without clouds. RP  Now she's going to go on like this for about three to four hours  and the idea is not for her to say everything that the target is going to want to say  but the idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language. The more speech you have  the better sounding voice you're going to have. Once you have those recordings  what we need to do is we have to parse these recordings into little snippets of speech  one  or two sound combinations  sometimes even whole words that start populating a dataset or a database. We're going to call this database a voice bank. Now the power of the voice bank is that from this voice bank  we can now say any new utterance  like   I love chocolate     everyone needs to be able to say that  fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance. RP  So that's speech synthesis. It's called concatenative synthesis  and that's what we're using. That's not the novel part. What's novel is how we make it sound like this young woman. This is Samantha. I met her when she was nine  and since then  my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice. We first had to find a surrogate donor  and then we had to have Samantha produce some utterances. What she can produce are mostly vowel like sounds  but that's enough for us to extract her source characteristics. What happens next is best described by my daughter's analogy. She's six. She calls it mixing colors to paint voices. It's beautiful. It's exactly that. Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice just like this. RP  So now  Samantha can say this. I can't wait to use my new voice with my friends. RP  Thank you.  Applause  I'll never forget the gentle smile that spread across her face when she heard that voice for the first time. Now there's millions of people around the world like Samantha  millions  and we've only begun to scratch the surface. What we've done so far is we have a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S. who have donated their voices  and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices. But there's so much more work to be done. For Samantha  her surrogate came from somewhere in the Midwest  a stranger who gave her the gift of voice. And as a scientist  I'm so excited to take this work out of the laboratory and finally into the real world so it can have real world impact. What I want to share with you next is how I envision taking this work to that next level. I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life  different sizes  different ages  coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities. To do that as a first step  we've put together this website  VocaliD.org  as a way to bring together those who want to join us as voice donors  as expertise donors  in whatever way to make this vision a reality. They say that giving blood can save lives. Well  giving your voice can change lives. All we need is a few hours of speech from our surrogate talker  and as little as a vowel from our target talker  to create a unique vocal identity. So that's the science behind what we're doing. I want to end by circling back to the human side that is really the inspiration for this work. About five years ago  we built our very first voice for a little boy named William. When his mom first heard this voice  she said   This is what William would have sounded like had he been able to speak.  And then I saw William typing a message on his device. I wondered  what was he thinking  Imagine carrying around someone else's voice for nine years and finally finding your own voice. Imagine that. This is what William said   Never heard me before.  Thank you. What is love  It's a hard term to define in so far as it has a very wide application. I can love jogging. I can love a book  a movie. I can love escalopes. I can love my wife. But there's a great difference between an escalope and my wife  for instance. That is  if I value the escalope  the escalope  on the other hand   it doesn't value me back. Whereas my wife  she calls me the star of her life. Therefore  only another desiring conscience can conceive me as a desirable being. I know this  that's why love can be defined in a more accurate way as the desire of being desired. Hence the eternal problem of love  how to become and remain desirable  The individual used to find an answer to this problem by submitting his life to community rules. You had a specific part to play according to your sex  your age  your social status  and you only had to play your part to be valued and loved by the whole community. Think about the young woman who must remain chaste before marriage. Think about the youngest son  who must obey the eldest son  who in turn must obey the patriarch. But a phenomenon started in the   th century  mainly in the Renaissance  in the West  that caused the biggest identity crisis in the history of humankind. This phenomenon is modernity. We can basically summarize it through a triple process. First  a process of rationalization of scientific research  which has accelerated technical progress. Next  a process of political democratization  which has fostered individual rights. And finally  a process of rationalization  of economic production and of trade liberalization. These three intertwined processes have completely annihilated all the traditional bearings of Western societies  with radical consequences for the individual. Now individuals are free to value or disvalue any attitude  any choice  any object. But as a result  they are themselves confronted with this same freedom that others have to value or disvalue them. In other words  my value was once ensured by submitting myself  to the traditional authorities. Now it is quoted in the stock exchange. On the free market of individual desires  I negotiate my value every day. Hence the anxiety of contemporary man. He is obsessed   Am I desirable  How desirable  How many people are going to love me   And how does he respond to this anxiety  Well  by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability. I call this act of collecting  along with others  seduction capital. Indeed  our consumer society is largely based on seduction capital. It is said about this consumption that our age is materialistic. But it's not true  We only accumulate objects in order to communicate with other minds. We do it to make them love us  to seduce them. Nothing could be less materialistic   or more sentimental  than a teenager buying brand new jeans and tearing them at the knees  because he wants to please Jennifer. Consumerism is not materialism. It is rather what is swallowed up and sacrificed in the name of the god of love  or rather in the name of seduction capital. In light of this observation on contemporary love  how can we think of love in the years to come  We can envision two hypotheses  The first one consists of betting that this process of narcissistic  capitalization will intensify. It is hard to say what shape  this intensification will take  because it largely depends on social and technical innovations  which are by definition difficult to predict. But we can  for instance  imagine a dating website which  a bit like those loyalty points programs  uses seduction capital points that vary according to my age   my height weight ratio  my degree  my salary  or the number of clicks on my profile. We can also imagine a chemical treatment for breakups that weakens the feelings of attachment. By the way  there's a program on MTV already in which seduction teachers treat heartache as a disease. These teachers call themselves  pick up artists.   Artist  in French is easy  it means  artiste.   Pick up  is to pick someone up  but not just any picking up    it's picking up chicks. So they are artists of picking up chicks. And they call heartache  one itis.  In English   itis  is a suffix that signifies infection. One itis can be translated as  an infection from one.  It's a bit disgusting. Indeed  for the pick up artists  falling in love with someone is a waste of time  it's squandering your seduction capital  so it must be eliminated like a disease  like an infection. We can also envision a romantic use of the genome. Everyone would carry it around and present it like a business card to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction. Of course  this race for seduction  like every fierce competition  will create huge disparities  in narcissistic satisfaction  and therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too. So we can expect that modernity itself  which is the origin of seduction capital  would be called into question. I'm thinking particularly of the reaction of neo fascist or religious communes. But such a future doesn't have to be. Another path to thinking about love may be possible. But how  How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued  Well  by becoming aware of my uselessness. Yes  I'm useless. But rest assured  so are you. We are all useless. This uselessness is easily demonstrated  because in order to be valued I need another to desire me  which shows that I do not have any value of my own. I don't have any inherent value. We all pretend to have an idol  we all pretend to be an idol for someone else  but actually we are all impostors  a bit like a man on the street who appears totally cool and indifferent  while he has actually anticipated and calculated so that all eyes are on him. I think that becoming aware of this general imposture that concerns all of us would ease our love relationships. It is because I want to be loved from head to toe  justified in my every choice  that the seduction hysteria exists. And therefore I want to seem perfect so that another can love me. I want them to be perfect so that I can be reassured of my value. It leads to couples obsessed with performance who will break up  just like that  at the slightest underachievement. In contrast to this attitude  I call upon tenderness    love as tenderness. What is tenderness  To be tender is to accept  the loved one's weaknesses. It's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies. That's pretty bad. On the contrary  there's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness. I refer specifically to a kind of humor that is unfortunately underused. It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness. I refer to self mockery. For a couple who is no longer sustained  supported by the constraints of tradition  I believe that self mockery is one of the best means for  the relationship to endure. As humans  it's in our nature to want to improve our health  and minimize our suffering. Whatever life throws at us  whether it's cancer  diabetes  heart disease  or even broken bones  we want to try and get better. Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab  and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body over time. Take  for example  this beautiful blue nacre shell. This was actually used by the Mayans as an artificial tooth replacement. We're not quite sure why they did it. It's hard. It's durable. But it also had other very nice properties. In fact  when they put it into the jawbone  it could integrate into the jaw  and we know now with very sophisticated imaging technologies that part of that integration comes from the fact that this material is designed in a very specific way  has a beautiful chemistry  has a beautiful architecture. And I think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans as the first real application of the bluetooth technology. But if we move on and think throughout history how people have used different  materials in the body  very often it's been physicians that have been quite creative. They've taken things off the shelf. One of my favorite examples is that of Sir Harold Ridley  who was a famous ophthalmologist  or at least became a famous ophthalmologist. And during World War II  what he would see would be pilots coming back from their missions  and he noticed that within their eyes they had shards of small bits of material lodged within the eye  but the very interesting thing about it was that material  actually  wasn't causing any inflammatory response. So he looked into this  and he figured out that actually that material was little shards of plastic that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires. And this led him to propose that material as a new material for intraocular lenses. It's called PMMA  and it's now used in millions of people every year and helps in preventing cataracts. And that example  I think  is a really nice one  because it helps remind us that in the early days  people often chose materials because they were bioinert. Their very purpose was to  perform a mechanical function. You'd put them in the body and you wouldn't get an adverse response. And what I want to show you is that in regenerative medicine  we've really shifted away from that idea of taking a bioinert material. We're actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive  that will interact with the body  and that furthermore we can put in the body  they'll have their function  and then they'll dissolve away over time. If we look at this schematic  this is showing you what we think of as the typical tissue engineering approach. We have cells there  typically from the patient. We can put those onto a material  and we can make that material  very complex if we want to  and we can then grow that up in the lab or we can put it straight back into the patient. And this is an approach that's  used all over the world  including in our lab. But one of the things that's really important when we're thinking about stem cells is that obviously stem cells  can be many different things  and they want to be many different things  and so we want to make sure that the environment we put them into has enough information so that they can become the right sort of specialist tissue. And if we think about the different types of tissues that people are looking at regenerating all over the world  in all the  different labs in the world  there's pretty much every tissue you can think of. And actually  the structure of those tissues is quite different  and it's going to really depend on whether your patient has any underlying disease  other conditions  in terms of how you're going to regenerate your tissue  and you're going to need to think about the materials you're going to use really carefully  their biochemistry  their mechanics  and many other properties as well. Our tissues all have very  different abilities to regenerate  and here we see poor Prometheus  who made a rather tricky career choice and was punished by the Greek gods. He was tied to a rock  and an eagle would come every day to eat his liver. But of course his liver would regenerate every day  and so day after day he was punished for eternity by the gods. And liver will regenerate in this very nice way  but actually if we think of other tissues  like cartilage  for example  even the simplest nick and you're going to find it really difficult to regenerate your cartilage. So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue. Now  bone is somewhere in between  and this is one of the tissues  that we work on a lot in our lab. And bone is actually quite good at repairing. It has to be. We've probably all had fractures at some point or other. And one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here  called  an iliac crest harvest. And what the surgeon might do is take some bone from your iliac crest  which is just here  and then transplant that  somewhere else in the body. And it actually works really well  because it's your own bone  and it's well vascularized  which means it's got a really good blood supply. But the problem is  there's only so much you can take  and also when you do that operation  your patients might actually have significant pain in that defect site even two  years after the operation. So what we were thinking is  there's a tremendous need  for bone repair  of course  but this iliac crest type approach really has a lot of limitations to it  and could we perhaps recreate the generation of bone within the body on demand and then be able to transplant it without these very  very painful aftereffects that you would have with the iliac crest harvest  And so this is what we did  and the way we did it was by coming back to this typical tissue engineering approach but actually thinking about it rather differently. And we simplified it a lot  so we got rid of a lot of these steps. We got rid of the need to  harvest cells from the patient  we got rid of the need to put  in really fancy chemistries  and we got rid of the need to culture these scaffolds in the lab. And what we really focused on was our material system and making it quite simple  but because we used it in a really clever way  we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone using this approach. So we were using the body as really the catalyst to help us to make lots of new bone. And it's an approach that we call the in vivo bioreactor  and we were able to make enormous amounts of bone using this approach. And I'll talk you through this. So what we do is  in humans  we all have a layer of stem cells on the outside of our long bones. That layer is called the periosteum. And that layer is actually normally very  very tightly bound to the underlying bone  and it's got stem cells in it. Those stem cells are really important in the embryo when it develops  and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture to help you with repairing the bone. So we take that periosteum layer and we developed a way to inject underneath it a liquid that then  within    seconds  would turn into quite a rigid gel and can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone. So it creates  in essence  an artificial cavity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells. And we go in through a pinhole incision so that no other cells from the body can get in  and what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells  and they can form lots of new tissue  and then over time  you can harvest that tissue and use it elsewhere in the body. This is a histology slide of what we see when we do that  and essentially what we see is very large amounts of bone. So in this picture  you can see the middle of the leg  so the bone marrow  then you can see the original bone  and you can see where that original bone finishes  and just to the left of that is the new bone that's grown within that bioreactor cavity  and you can actually make it even larger. And that demarcation that you can see between the original bone and the new bone acts as a very slight point of weakness  so actually now the surgeon can come along  can harvest away that new bone  and the periosteum can grow back  so you're left with the leg in the same sort of state as if you hadn't operated on it in the first place. So it's very  very low in terms of after pain compared to an iliac crest harvest. And you can grow different amounts of bone depending on how much gel you put in there  so it really is an on demand sort of procedure. Now  at the time that we did this  this received a lot of attention in the press  because it was a really nice way of generating new bone  and we got many  many contacts from different people that  were interested in using this. And I'm just going to tell you  sometimes those contacts are very strange  slightly unexpected  and the very most interesting  let me put it that way  contact that I had  was actually from a team of American footballers that all wanted to have double thickness skulls made on their head. And so you do get these kinds of contacts  and of course  being British and also growing up in France  I tend to be very blunt  and so I had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case  there probably wasn't that much in there to protect in the first place. So this was our approach  and it was simple materials  but we thought about it carefully. And actually we know that those cells in the body  in the embryo  as they develop can form a different kind of tissue  cartilage  and so we developed a gel that was slightly different in nature and slightly different chemistry  put it in there  and we were able to get     percent cartilage instead. And this approach works really well  I think  for pre planned procedures  but it's something you do have to pre plan. So for other kinds of operations  there's definitely a need for other scaffold based approaches. And when you think about designing those other scaffolds  actually  you need a really multi disciplinary team. And so our team has chemists  it has cell biologists  surgeons  physicists even  and those people all come together and we think really hard about  designing the materials. But we want to make them have enough information that we can get the cells to do what we want  but not be so complex as to make it difficult to get to clinic. And so one of the things we think about a lot is really trying to understand the structure of the tissues in the body. And so if we think of bone  obviously my own favorite tissue  we zoom in  we can see  even if you don't know anything  about bone structure  it's beautifully organized   really beautifully organized. We've lots of blood vessels in there. And if we zoom in again  we see that the cells are actually surrounded by a  D matrix of nano scale fibers  and they give a lot of information to the cells. And if we zoom in again  actually in the case of bone  the matrix around the cells is beautifully organized at the nano scale  and it's a hybrid material that's part organic  part inorganic. And that's led to a whole field  really  that has looked at developing materials that have this hybrid kind of structure. And so I'm showing here just two examples where we've made some materials that have that sort of structure  and you can really tailor it. You can see here a very squishy one and now a material that's also  this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable toughness  and it's no longer brittle. And an inorganic material  would normally be really brittle  and you wouldn't be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it. One other thing I want to quickly mention is that many of the scaffolds we make  are porous  and they have to be  because you want blood vessels to grow in there. But the pores are actually oftentimes much bigger than the cells  and so even though it's  D  the cell might see it more  as a slightly curved surface  and that's a little bit unnatural. And so one of the things you can think about doing is actually making scaffolds  with slightly different dimensions that might be able to surround your cells in  D and give them a little bit more information. And there's a lot of work going  on in both of these areas. Now finally  I just want to talk a little bit about applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease  because this is a really big clinical problem. And one of the things that we know is that  unfortunately  if you have a heart attack  then that tissue can start to die  and your outcome may not be very good over time. And it would be really great  actually  if we could stop that dead tissue either from dying or help it to regenerate. And there's lots and lots of stem  cell trials going on worldwide  and they use many different types of cells  but one common theme that seems to be coming out is that actually  very often  those cells will die once you've implanted them. And you can either put them into the heart or into the blood system  but either way  we don't seem to be able to get quite the right number of cells getting to the location we want them to and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful cell regeneration that we would like to have to get good clinical outcomes. And so some of the things that we're thinking of  and many other people in the field are thinking of  are actually developing materials for that. But there's a difference here. We still need chemistry  we still need mechanics  we still need really interesting topography  and we still need really interesting  ways to surround the cells. But now  the cells also would probably quite like a material that's going to be able to be conductive  because the cells themselves will respond very well and will actually conduct signals  between themselves. You can see them now beating synchronously on these materials  and that's a very  very exciting development that's going on. So just to wrap up  I'd like to actually say that being able to work in this sort of field  all of us that work in this field that's not only super exciting science  but also has the potential to impact on patients  however big or small they are  is really a great privilege. And so for that  I'd like to thank all of you as well. Thank you. What makes a great leader today  Many of us carry this image of this all knowing superhero who stands and commands and protects his followers. But that's kind of an image from another time  and what's also outdated are the leadership development programs that are based on success models for a world that was  not a world that is or that is coming. We conducted a study of       companies  and we asked them  let's see the effectiveness of your leadership development programs. Fifty eight percent of the companies cited significant talent gaps for critical leadership roles. That means that despite corporate training programs  off sites  assessments  coaching  all of these things  more than half the companies had failed to grow enough great leaders. You may be asking yourself  is my company helping me to prepare to be a great   st century leader  The odds are  probably not. Now  I've spent    years of my professional life observing what makes great leaders. I've worked inside Fortune     companies  I've advised over     CEOs  and I've cultivated more leadership pipelines than you can imagine. But a few years ago  I noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation. I noticed that  despite all the efforts  there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals. One story was about Chris  a high potential  superstar leader who moves to a new unit and fails  destroying unrecoverable value. And then there were stories like Sidney  the CEO  who was so frustrated because her company is cited as a best company for leaders  but only one of the top    leaders is equipped to lead their crucial initiatives. And then there were stories like the senior leadership team of a once thriving business that's surprised by a market shift  finds itself having to force the company to reduce its size in half or go out of business. Now  these recurring stories cause me to ask two questions. Why are the leadership gaps widening when there's so much more investment in leadership development  And what are the great leaders doing distinctly different to thrive and grow  One of the things that I did  I was so consumed by these questions and also frustrated by those stories  that I left my job so that I could study this full time  and I took a year to travel to different parts of the world to learn about effective and ineffective leadership practices in companies  countries and nonprofit organizations. And so I did things like travel to South Africa  where I had an opportunity to understand how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political  social and economic context. I also met a number of nonprofit leaders who  despite very limited financial resources  were making a huge impact in the world  often bringing together seeming adversaries. And I spent countless hours in presidential libraries trying to understand how the environment had shaped the leaders  the moves that they made  and then the impact of those moves beyond their tenure. And then  when I returned to work full time  in this role  I joined with wonderful colleagues who were also interested in these questions. Now  from all this  I distilled the characteristics of leaders who are thriving and what they do differently  and then I also distilled the preparation practices that enable people to grow to their potential. I want to share some of those with you now. In a   st century world  which is more global  digitally enabled and transparent  with faster speeds of information  flow and innovation  and where nothing big gets done without some kind of a complex matrix  relying on traditional development practices will stunt your growth as a leader. In fact  traditional assessments like narrow     surveys or outdated performance criteria will give you false positives  lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are. Leadership in the   st century is defined and evidenced by three questions. Where are you looking to anticipate the next change to your business model or your life  The answer to this question is on your calendar. Who are you spending time with  On what topics  Where are you traveling  What are you reading  And then how are you distilling this into understanding potential discontinuities  and then making a decision to do something right now so that you're prepared and ready  There's a leadership team that does a practice where they bring together each member collecting  here are trends that impact me  here are trends that impact another team member  and they share these  and then make decisions  to course correct a strategy or to anticipate a new move. Great leaders are not head down. They see around corners  shaping their future  not just reacting to it. The second question is  what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network  You know  we hear often about  good ol' boy networks and they're certainly alive and  well in many institutions. But to some extent  we all have a network of people that we're comfortable with. So this question is about your capacity to develop relationships with people that are very different than you. And those differences can be biological  physical  functional  political   cultural  socioeconomic. And yet  despite all these differences  they connect with you and they trust you enough to cooperate with you in achieving a shared goal. Great leaders understand that having a more diverse network is a source of pattern identification at greater levels and also of solutions  because you have people that are thinking differently than you are. Third question  are you courageous enough to abandon a practice that has  made you successful in the past  There's an expression  Go along to get along. But if you follow this advice  chances are as a leader  you're going to keep doing what's familiar and comfortable. Great leaders dare to be different. They don't just talk about risk taking  they actually do it. And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea is na ve or reckless or just plain stupid. Now interestingly  the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network. They're often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a courageous leap. And it's a leap  not a step. More than traditional leadership programs  answering these three questions will determine your effectiveness as a   st century leader. So what makes a great leader in the   st century  I've met many  and they stand out. They are women and men who are preparing themselves not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday but also for the realities of today and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow. Thank you. I'm going to go off script and make Chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation. All right. Are you with me  Yeah. Yeah. All right. So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand if you've ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex. Could be the neighbors  hotel room  your parents. Sorry. Okay. Pretty much everybody. Now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman. I see one guy there. It doesn't count if it was you  sir. So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay. Sitting next to a loud guy. Now what does this tell us  It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex  and it's generally the woman who makes more noise. This is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd. I wasn't even going to mention this  but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here  and she is the world's most famous female copulatory vocalizer. So I thought  got to talk about that. We'll get back to that a little bit later. Let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes  despite what you may have heard. We are apes. We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant  as Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books. We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate    gorillas  orangutans  what have you. So we're extremely closely related to them  and as you'll see in terms of our behavior  we've got some relationship as well. So what I'm asking today  the question I want to explore with you today is  what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality  Now  since Darwin's day there's been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution  and you're all familiar with it  even if you haven't read this stuff. The idea is that  as part of human nature  from the beginning of our species' time  men have sort of leased women's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services. Generally we're talking about meat  shelter  status  protection  things like that. And in exchange  women have offered fidelity  or at least a promise of fidelity. Now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship. The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA  according to this vision. Right  What Cacilda and I have argued is that no  this economic relationship  this oppositional relationship  is actually an artifact of agriculture  which only arose about        years ago at the earliest. Anatomically modern human beings have been around for about         years  so we're talking about five percent  at most  of our time as a modern  distinct species. So before agriculture  before the agricultural revolution  it's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they're found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism. They not only share things  they demand that things be shared  meat  shelter  protection  all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity  it turns out  are shared widely among these societies. Now I'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages  and I'm not saying modern day hunter gatherers are noble savages either. What I'm saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context. And there's really no argument about this among anthropologists. All Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality. So we've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved  until agriculture  as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex  flexible social systems  networks  that our ancestors were very good at  and that's why our species has survived so well. Now  this makes some people uncomfortable  and so I always need to take  a moment in these talks to say  listen  I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous  but I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. There were no strangers. Right  In a hunter gatherer band  there are no strangers. You've known these people your entire life. So I'm saying  yes  there were overlapping sexual relationships  that our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives. But I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. I'm not saying that they didn't love the people they were having sex with. And I'm not saying there was no pair bonding going on. I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive. And those of us who have chosen to be monogamous    my parents  for example  have been married for    years monogamously  and if it wasn't monogamously  Mom and Dad  I don't want to hear about it  I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this. What I'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism. You can choose to be a vegetarian  but don't think that just because you've made that decision  bacon suddenly stops smelling good. Okay  So this is my point. That one took a minute to sink in  huh  Now  in addition to being a great genius  a wonderful man  a wonderful husband  a wonderful father  Charles Darwin was also a world class Victorian prude. All right  He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates  including chimps and bonobos  because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females. So he couldn't understand why on Earth would the female have developed this thing if all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond  right  Chimps and bonobos  Darwin didn't really know this  but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings. Interestingly  chimps have sexual swellings through    percent  roughly  of their menstrual cycle  bonobos    percent  and humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle  whether she's menstruating  whether she's post menopausal  whether she's already pregnant. This is vanishingly rare among mammals. So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality. Now  Darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day  as scientists tend to do sometimes. So what we're talking about is sperm competition. Now the average human ejaculate has about     million sperm cells  so it's already a competitive environment. The question is whether these sperm are  competing against other men's sperm or just their own. There's a lot to talk about in this chart. The one thing I'll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human. That indicates female copulatory vocalization. Just look at the numbers. The average human has sex about       times per birth. If that number seems high for some of you  I assure you it seems low for others in the room. We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos. We don't share it with the other three apes  the gorilla  the orangutan and the gibbon  who are more typical of mammals  having sex only about a dozen times per birth. Humans and bonobos are the only  animals that have sex face to face when both of them are alive. And you'll see that the human  chimp and bonobo all have external testicles  which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer. If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage  you expect a party to happen at any moment  and you need to be ready. That's what the external testicles are. They keep the sperm cells cool so you can have frequent ejaculations. I'm sorry. It's true. The human  some of you will be happy to hear  has the largest  thickest penis of any primate. Now  this evidence goes way beyond anatomy. It goes into anthropology as well. Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution. These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China. In their society  everyone  men and women  are completely sexually autonomous. There's no shame associated with sexual behavior. Women have hundreds of partners. It doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nobody gossips. It's not an issue. When the woman becomes pregnant  the child is cared for by her   her sisters  and her brothers. The biological father is a nonissue. On the other side of the planet  in the Amazon  we've got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity. These people actually believe    and they have no contact among them  no common language or anything  so it's not an idea that spread  it's an idea that's arisen around the world    they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen. So a woman who wants to have a child who's smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy  the funny guy and the strong guy  to get the essence of each of these men into the baby  and then when the child is born  these different men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child. So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor in this society. So there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book. Now  why does this matter  Edward Wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation. I think that's true. This matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world. The contradictions between what we're told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering. My hope is that a more accurate  updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves  for each other  greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations like same sex marriage or polyamorous unions  and that we'll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate  instinctive right to monitor and control women's sexual behavior. Thank you. And we'll see that it's not only gay people that have to come out of the closet. We all have closets we have to come out of. Right  And when we do come out of those closets  we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other  our fight is with an outdated   Victorian sense of human sexuality that conflates desire with property rights  generates shame and confusion in place of understanding and empathy. It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus  because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Christopher Ryan  Thank you. CA  So a question. It's so perplexing  trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today. Someone could give a talk and say  look at us  we've got these really sharp teeth and muscles and a brain that's really good at throwing weapons  and if you look at lots of societies around the world  you'll see very high rates of violence. Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism  but it's not who you are. How is that different from the talk you gave  CR  Well first of all  the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable. But that's just an example. Certainly  you know  lots of people say to me  just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn't mean we should live that  way now  and I agree with that. Everyone has to respond to the modern world. But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories. And so you could live on McDonald's and milkshakes  but your body will rebel against  that. We have appetites. I think it was Schopenhauer who said  a person can do what they want but not want what they want. And so what I'm arguing against is the shame that's associated with desires. It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people  there's something wrong with you  there's something wrong with your marriage  something wrong with your partner. I think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality. That's what I'm trying to get at. CA  Thank you. Communicated powerfully. Thanks a lot. CR  Thank you  Chris.  Applause  I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet  and not in the traditional sense  not just the gay closet. I think we all have closets. Your closet may be telling someone you love her for the first time  or telling someone that you're pregnant  or telling someone you have cancer  or any of the other hard conversations we have throughout our lives. All a closet is is a hard conversation  and although our topics may vary tremendously  the experience of being in and coming out of the closet is universal. It is scary  and we hate it  and it needs to be done. Several years ago  I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe  a local diner in town  and during my time there I would go through phases of militant lesbian intensity  not shaving my armpits  quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel. And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts and how recently I had shaved my head  the question would often be sprung on me  usually by a little kid   Um  are you a boy or are you a girl   And there would be an awkward silence at the table. I'd clench my jaw a little tighter  hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance. The dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid. But I would say nothing  and I would seethe inside. And it got to the point where every time I walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and    years old  I was ready to fight. And that is a terrible feeling. So I promised myself  the next time  I would say something. I would have that hard conversation. So within a matter of weeks  it happens again.  Are you a boy or are you a girl   Familiar silence  but this time I'm ready  and I am about to go all Women's Studies     on this table.  Laughter  I've got my Betty Friedan quotes. I've got my Gloria Steinem quotes. I've even got this little bit from  Vagina Monologues  I'm going to do. So I take a deep breath and I look down and staring back at me is a four year old girl in a pink dress  not a challenge to a feminist duel  just a kid with a question   Are you a boy or are you a girl   So I take another deep breath  squat down to next to her  and say   Hey  I know it's kind of confusing. My hair is short like a boy's  and I wear boy's clothes  but I'm a girl  and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress  and sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies  Well  I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl.  And this kid looks me dead in the eye  without missing a beat  and says   My favorite pajamas are purple with fish. Can I get a pancake  please   And that was it. Just   Oh  okay. You're a girl. How about that pancake   It was the easiest hard conversation I have ever had. And why  Because Pancake Girl and I  we were both real with each other. So like many of us  I've lived in a few closets in my life  and yeah  most often  my walls happened to be rainbow. But inside  in the dark  you can't tell what color the walls are. You just know what it feels like to live in a closet. So really  my closet is no different than yours or yours or yours. Sure  I'll give you     reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours  but here's the thing  Hard is not relative. Hard is hard. Who can tell me that explaining to someone you've just declared bankruptcy is harder than telling someone you just cheated on them  Who can tell me that his coming out story is harder than telling your five year old  you're getting a divorce  There is no harder  there is just hard. We need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else's hard to make us feel better or worse about our closets and just commiserate on the  fact that we all have hard. At some point in our lives  we all live in closets  and they may feel safe  or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door. But I am here to tell you  no matter what your walls are made of  a closet is no place for a person to live. Thanks.  Applause  So imagine yourself    years ago. Me  I had a ponytail  a strapless dress  and high heeled shoes. I was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any four year old that walked into the cafe. I was frozen by fear  curled up in the corner of my pitch black closet clutching my gay grenade  and moving one muscle is the scariest thing I have ever done. My family  my friends  complete strangers    I had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people  and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose. I was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long  but if you do not throw that grenade  it will kill you. One of my most memorable grenade tosses was at my sister's wedding. It was the first time that many in attendance knew I was gay  so in doing  my maid of honor duties  in my black dress and heels  I walked around to tables and finally landed on a table of my parents' friends  folks that had known me for years. And after a little small talk  one of the women shouted out   I love Nathan Lane   And the battle of gay relatability had begun.  Ash  have you ever been to the Castro    Well  yeah  actually  we have friends in San Francisco.   Well  we've never been there but we've heard it's fabulous.   Ash  do you know my hairdresser Antonio  He's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend.   Ash  what's your favorite TV show  Our favorite TV show  Favorite  Will   Grace. And you know who we love  Jack. Jack is our favorite.  And then one woman  stumped but wanting so desperately to show her support  to let me know she was on my side  she finally blurted out   Well  sometimes my husband wears pink shirts.  And I had a choice in that moment  as all grenade throwers do. I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay loving table and mock their responses  chastise their unworldliness and their inability to jump through the politically correct  gay hoops I had brought with me  or I could empathize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done  that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their closets. Sure  it would have been easy to point out where they felt short. It's a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were trying. And what else can you ask someone to do but try  If you're going to be real with someone  you gotta be ready for real in return. So hard conversations are still not my strong suit. Ask anybody I have ever dated. But I'm getting better  and I follow what I like to call the three Pancake Girl principles. Now  please view this through gay colored lenses  but know what it takes to come out of any closet is essentially the same. Number one  Be authentic. Take the armor off. Be yourself. That kid in the cafe had no armor  but I was ready for battle. If you want someone to be real with you  they need to know that you bleed too. Number two  Be direct. Just say it. Rip the Band Aid off. If you know you are gay  just say it. If you tell your parents you might be gay  they will hold out hope that this will change. Do not give them that sense of false hope. And number three  and most important    Be unapologetic. You are speaking your truth. Never apologize for that. And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way  so sure  apologize for what you've done  but never apologize for who you are. And yeah  some folks may be disappointed  but that is on them  not on you. Those are their expectations of who you are  not yours. That is their story  not yours. The only story that matters is the one that you want to write. So the next time you find yourself in a pitch black closet clutching your grenade  know we have all been there before. And you may feel so very alone  but you are not. And we know it's hard but we need you out here  no matter what your walls are made of  because I guarantee you there are others peering through the keyholes of their closets looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open  so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our closets and that a closet is no place for a person to truly live. Thank you  Boulder. Enjoy your night.  Applause  I'm very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about how we might repair the damaged brain  and I'm particularly excited by this field  because as a neurologist myself  I believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope for patients who today live with devastating and yet untreatable diseases of the brain. So here's the problem. You can see here the picture of somebody's brain with Alzheimer's disease next to a healthy brain  and what's obvious is  in the Alzheimer's brain  ringed red  there's obvious damage    atrophy  scarring. And I could show you equivalent pictures from other disease  multiple sclerosis  motor neuron disease  Parkinson's disease  even Huntington's disease  and they would all tell a similar story. And collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time. And the numbers here are really rather staggering. At any one time  there are    million people today living with one of these brain diseases  and the annual cost globally is     billion dollars. I mean  just think about that. That's greater than one percent of the global GDP. And it gets worse  because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large age related diseases  and we're living longer. So the question we really need to ask ourselves is  why  given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual  never mind the scale of the societal problem  why are there no effective treatments  Now in order to consider this  I first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works. So in other words  I need to tell you everything I learned at medical school. But believe me  this isn't going to take very long. Okay   Laughter  So the brain is terribly simple  it's made up of four cells  and two of them are shown here. There's the nerve cell  and then there's the myelinating cell  or the insulating cell. It's called oligodendrocyte. And when these four cells work together in health and harmony  they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity  and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think  to emote  to remember  to learn  move  feel and so on. But equally  each of these individual four cells alone or together  can go rogue or die  and when that happens  you get damage. You get damaged wiring. You get disrupted connections. And that's evident here with the slower conduction. But ultimately  this damage will manifest as disease  clearly. And if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve  for example  you'll get motor neuron disease. So I'd like to give you a real life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease. So this is a patient of mine called John. John I saw just last week in the clinic. And I've asked John to tell us something  about what were his problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease. John  I was diagnosed in October in       and the main problem was a breathing problem  difficulty breathing. Siddharthan Chandran  I don't know if you caught all of that  but what John was telling us was that difficulty with breathing led eventually to the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. So John's now    months further down in that journey  and I've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament. John  What I've got now is  the breathing's gotten worse. I've got weakness in my hands   my arms and my legs. So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time. SC  John's just told us he's in a wheelchair most of the time. So what these two clips show is not just the devastating consequence of the disease  but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease  because in just    months  a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair  and respirator dependent. And let's face it  John could be anybody's father  brother or friend. So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies. But what happens when that myelin cell dies  You get multiple sclerosis. So the scan on your left is an illustration of the brain  and it's a map of the connections of the brain  and superimposed upon which are areas of damage. We call them lesions of demyelination. But they're damage  and they're white. So I know what you're thinking here. You're thinking   My God  this bloke came up and said he's going to talk about hope  and all he's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale.  I've told you these diseases are terrible. They're devastating  numbers are rising  the costs are ridiculous  and worst of all  we have no treatment. Where's the hope  Well  you know what  I think there is hope. And there's hope in this next section  of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.  because what it illustrates is  amazingly  the brain can repair itself. It just doesn't do it well enough. And so again  there are two things I want to show you. First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S. And again  it's another one of these white masses. But crucially  the area that's ringed red highlights an area that is pale blue. But that area that is pale blue was once white. So it was damaged. It's now repaired. Just to be clear  It's not because of doctors. It's in spite of doctors  not because of doctors. This is spontaneous repair. It's amazing and it's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain  even  which can enable new myelin  new insulation  to be laid down over the damaged nerves. And this observation is important for two reasons. The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school  or at least I did  admittedly last century  which is that the brain doesn't repair itself  unlike  say  the bone or the liver. But actually it does  but it just doesn't do it well enough. And the second thing it does  and it gives us a very clear direction  of travel for new therapies    I mean  you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here. You simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous  spontaneous repair that occurs anyway. So the question is  why  if we've known that for some time  as we have  why do we not have those treatments  And that in part reflects the complexity of drug development. Now  drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet  and the odds of this bet are roughly this  they're        to one against  because you need to screen about        compounds to find that one potential winner. And then you need to spend    years and spend over a billion dollars  and even then  you may not have a winner. So the question for us is  can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds  And in order to do that  you have to think  where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery  And one of the bottlenecks is  early in drug discovery. All that screening occurs in animal models. But we know that the proper  study of mankind is man  to borrow from Alexander Pope. So the question is  can we study these diseases using human material  And of course  absolutely we can. We can use stem cells  and specifically we can use human stem cells. And human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things  they can self renew or make more of themselves  but they can also become specialized to make bone  liver or  crucially  nerve cells  maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell. And the challenge has long been  can we harness the power  the undoubted power of these stem cells in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology  And I think we can now  and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last        years. One of them was here in Edinburgh  and it must be the only celebrity sheep  Dolly. So Dolly was made in Edinburgh  and Dolly was an example of the first cloning of a mammal from an adult cell. But I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in      by a Japanese scientist called Yamanaka. And what Yamaka did  in a fantastic form of scientific cookery  was he showed that four ingredients  just four ingredients  could effectively convert any cell  adult cell  into a master stem cell. And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate  because what it means that from anybody in this room  but particularly patients  you could now generate a bespoke  personalized tissue repair kit. Take a skin cell  make it a master pluripotent cell  so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease  both to study but potentially to treat. Now  the idea of that at medical school    this is a recurring theme  isn't  it  me and medical school    would have been ridiculous  but it's an absolute reality today. And I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration  repair and hope. And whilst we're on the theme of hope  for those of you who might have failed at school  there's hope for you as well  because this is the school report of John Gerdon.   I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist  on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.   So they didn't think much of him then. But what you may not know is that he  got the Nobel Prize for medicine just three months ago. So to return to the original problem  what is the opportunity of these stem cells  or this disruptive technology  for repairing the damaged brain  which we call regenerative neurology  I think there are two ways you can think about this  as a fantastic   st century drug discovery tool  and or as a form of therapy. So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments. Drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this. It's very simple  You take a patient with a disease  let's say motor neuron disease  you take a skin sample  you do the pluripotent reprogramming  as I've already told you  and you generate live motor nerve cells. That's straightforward  because that's what pluripotent cells can do. But crucially  you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts  ideally from an unaffected relative. That way  you're matching for genetic variation. And that's exactly what we did here. This was a collaboration with colleagues  in London  Chris Shaw  in the U.S.   Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis. And what you're looking at  and this is amazing  these are living  growing  motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease. It happens to be an inherited form. I mean  just imagine that. This would have been unimaginable    years ago. So apart from seeing them grow and put out processes  we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce  but crucially  we can then track their individual health and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones. And when you do all that and put it together  you realize that the diseased ones  which is represented in the red line  are two and a half times more likely to die than the healthy counterpart. And the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs  because what would you ask of the drugs  and you could do this through a high throughput automated screening system  you'd ask the drugs  give me one thing  find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line  because that drug will be a high value candidate that you could probably take direct to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that I've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models  if that makes sense. It's fantastic. But I want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage. And again there are two ways to think about this  and they're not mutually exclusive. The first  and I think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend  but it's not thought of that way just yet  is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain  and I've told you that. All of us have stem cells in the brain  even the diseased brain  and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it. That will be the future. There will be drugs that will do that. But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells  transplant them in  to replace dying or lost cells  even in the brain. And I want to tell you now an experiment  it's a clinical trial that we did  which recently completed  which is with colleagues in UCL  David Miller in particular. So this study was very simple. We took patients with multiple sclerosis and asked a simple question  Would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves  So what we did was we took this bone marrow  grew up the stem cells in the lab  and then injected them back into the vein. I'm making this sound really simple. It took five years off a lot of people  okay  And it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues. But conceptually  it's essentially simple. So we've given them into the vein  right  So in order to measure whether this was successful or not  we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure. And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.  because patients with M.S. sadly suffer with problems with vision    loss of vision  unclear vision. And so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with David Miller three times       months  six months  and before the infusion    and you can see the gently declining red line. And that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking  which makes sense  because their nerves are dying. We then gave the stem cell infusion and repeated the measurement twice    three months and six months    and to our surprise  almost  the line's gone up. That suggests that the intervention has been protective. I don't think myself that what's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves. What I think they've done is they've promoted the endogenous stem cells  or precursor cells  to do their job  wake up  lay down new myelin. So this is a proof of concept. I'm very excited about that. So I just want to end with the theme I began on  which was regeneration and hope. So here I've asked John what his hopes are for the future. John  I would hope that sometime in the future through the research that you people are doing  we can come up with a cure so that people like me can lead a normal life. SC  I mean  that speaks volumes. But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John    thanking John for allowing me to share his insights and these clips with you all. But I'd also like to add to John and to others that my own view is  I'm hopeful for the future. I do believe that the disruptive technologies like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you do offer very real hope. And I do think that the day that we might be able to repair the damaged brain is sooner than we think. Thank you. I'm going to talk about hackers. And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin  but I'm going to explain to you why it should be. The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous  or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity  or of an international rogue with a political agenda. And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of. But like most things in technology and the technology world  hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil. For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill. Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system  and it is a deeply democratic activity. It's about critical thinking. It's about questioning existing ways of doing things. It's the idea that if you see a  problem  you work to fix it  and not just complain about it. And in many ways  hacking is what built America. Betsy Ross was a hacker. The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack. And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs  hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy. So if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today  it's that the next time you think about who a hacker is  you think not of this guy but of this guy  Benjamin Franklin  who was one of the greatest hackers of all time. He was one of America's most prolific inventors  though he famously never filed a patent  because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available. He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod  and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of American democracy. And in Code For America  we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin. He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action. He believed that government could be built by the people  and we call those people civic hackers. So it's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy  like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise  are the same values that underly the Internet. And so it's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government. But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like  I want to make clear that you don't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker. You just have to believe that you can bring a   st century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces. And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects. So keep that in mind. All of you are potential civic hackers. So what does civic hacking look like  Our team last year in Honolulu  which in this case was three full time fellows who were doing a year of public service  were asked by the city to rebuild the website. And it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn't going to be possible in the few months that they had. So instead  they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website. They're looking for answers to questions  and they want to take action when they're done  which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this. So our team built Honolulu Answers  which is a super simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action. Now the site itself was easy enough to build  but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content. It would have taken the three of them a very long time  especially given that none of  them are actually from Honolulu. And so they did something that's really radical  when you think about how government is used to working. They asked citizens to write the content. So you've heard of a hack a thon. They held a write a thon  where on one Saturday afternoon    Wild pigs are a huge problem  in Honolulu  apparently. In one Saturday afternoon  they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions  but more importantly than that  they created a new way for citizens  to participate in their government. Now  I think this is a really cool story in and of itself  but it gets more awesome. On the National Day of Civic Hacking this past June in Oakland  where I live  the Code For America team in Oakland took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers and turned it into Oakland Answers  and again we held a write a thon where we took the most frequently asked questions and had citizens write the answers to them  and I got into the act. I authored this answer  and a few others. And I'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation. And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we're enabling through civic hacking  we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government. At this point  you may be wondering what city officials think of all this. They actually love it. As most of you guys know  cities are being asked every day to do more with less  and they're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems. So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting  cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government. Now I don't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon. It's happening across the globe  and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City  where earlier this year  the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills. So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House. And the contract was a two year contract for  .  million dollars. Now a lot of people were really angry about this  especially geeks who knew that  .  million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app. But instead of taking to the streets  they issued a challenge. They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper  and they offered a prize of       dollars           times cheaper than the government contract  and they gave the entrants    days. And in those    days  they submitted     apps  five of which were presented to Congress and are still in the app store today. And because of this action  that contract was vacated  and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners  Code for Mexico City. And so what you see in all three of these places  in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City  are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking. It's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them  and through that work  they're creating a   st century ecosystem of participation. They're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved  besides voting or signing a petition or protesting. They can actually build government. So back to our friend Ben Franklin  who  one of his lesser known accomplishments was that in      he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia  called a brigade. And it's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city  so in true civic hacker fashion  they built a solution. And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I've just described  and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps and come join us. We have    brigades in the U.S. We are pleased to announce today that we're opening up the  brigade to international cities for the first time  starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland. You can find out if there's a brigade where you live at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and if there's not a brigade where you live  we will help you. We've created a tool kit which also lives at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and we will support you along the way. Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems  that will support local government  and that will empower citizens. So please come hack with us. Thank you. Thirteen years ago  we set ourselves a goal to end poverty. After some success  we've hit a big hurdle. The aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments  which have fallen for two consecutive years. My question is whether the lessons learned from saving the financial system can be used to help us overcome that hurdle and help millions. Can we simply print money for aid   Surely not.  It's a common reaction. It's a quick talk. Others channel John McEnroe.  You cannot be serious   Now  I can't do the accent  but I am serious  thanks to these two children  who  as you'll learn  are very much at the heart of my talk. On the left  we have Pia. She lives in England. She has two loving parents  one of whom is standing right here. Dorothy  on the right  lives in rural Kenya. She's one of        orphans and vulnerable children who are assisted by a charity that I support. I do that because I believe that Dorothy  like Pia  deserves the best life chances that we can afford to give her. You'll all agree with me  I'm sure. The U.N. agrees too. Their overriding aim for international aid is to strive for a life of dignity for all. But    and here's that hurdle    can we afford our aid aspirations  History suggests not. In       governments set themselves a target to increase overseas aid payments to  .  percent of their national income. As you can see  a big gap opens up between actual aid and that target. But then come the Millennium Development Goals  eight ambitious targets to be met by     . If I tell you that just one of those targets is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty  you get a sense of the ambition. There's also been some success. The number of people living on less than   .   a day has halved. But a lot remains to be done in two years. One in eight remain hungry. In the context of this auditorium  the front two rows aren't going to get any food. We can't settle for that  which is why the concern about the eighth goal  which relates to funding  which I said at the beginning is falling  is so troubling. So what can be done  Well  I work in financial markets  not development. I study the behavior of investors  how they react to policy and the economy. It gives me a different angle on the aid issue. But it took an innocent question from my then four year old daughter to make me appreciate that. Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe and we passed a man collecting for charity. I didn't have any change to give him  and she was disappointed. Once in the cafe  Pia takes out her coloring book and starts scribbling. After a little while  I ask her what she's doing  and she shows me a drawing of a    note to give to the man outside. It's so sweet  and more generous than Dad would have been. But of course I explained to her   You can't do that  it's not allowed.  To which I get the classic four year old response   Why not   Now I'm excited  because I actually think I can answer this time. So I launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money chasing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon. Something about that exchange stuck with me  not because of the look of relief on Pia's face when I finally finished  but because it related to the sanctity of the money supply  a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned by the reaction of central banks to the financial crisis. To reassure investors  central banks began buying assets to try and encourage investors to do the same. They funded these purchases with money they created themselves. The money wasn't actually physically printed. It's still sort of locked away in the banking system today. But the amount created was unprecedented. Together  the central banks of the U.S.  U.K and Japan increased the stock of money in their economies by  .  trillion dollars. That's three times  in fact that's more than three times  the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation. Three times  Before the crisis  this would have been utterly unthinkable  yet it was accepted remarkably quickly. The price of gold  an asset thought to protect against inflation  did jump  but investors bought other assets that offered little protection from inflation. They bought fixed income securities  bonds. They bought equities too. For all the scare stories  the actual actions of investors spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence. That confidence was based on two pillars. The first was that  after years of keeping inflation under control  central banks were trusted to take the money printing away if inflation became a threat. Secondly  inflation simply never became a threat. As you can see  in the United States  inflation for most of this period remained below average. It was the same elsewhere. So how does all this relate to aid  Well  this is where Dorothy and the Mango Tree charity that supports her comes in. I was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year  and I was inspired to give a one off donation when I remembered that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make. So think of this  Instead of just being able to help Dorothy and four of her classmates to go through secondary school for a few years  I was able to double my contribution. Brilliant. So following that conversation with my daughter  and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of money printing  and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time  this made me wonder  Could we match but just on a much grander scale  Let's call this scheme  Print Aid.  And here's how it might work. Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so  the central bank would be mandated to match the government's overseas aid payments up to a certain limit. Governments have been aiming to get aid to  .  percent for years  so let's set the limit at half of that   .   percent of their income. So it would work like this  If in a given year the government gave  .  percent of its income to overseas aid  the central bank would simply top it up with a further  .  percent. So far so good. How risky is this  Well  this involves the creation of money to buy goods  not assets. It sounds more inflationary already  doesn't it. But there are two important mitigating factors here. The first is that by definition  this money printed would be spent overseas. So it's not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country. That is unlikely for the second reason  the scale of the money that would be printed under this scheme. So let's think of an example where Print Aid was in place in the U.S.  U.K. and Japan. To match the aid payments made by those governments over the last four years  Print Aid would have generated     billion dollars' worth of extra aid. What would that look like in the context of the increase in the money stock that had already happened in those countries to save the financial system  Are you read for this  You might struggle to see that at the back  because the gap is quite small. So what we're saying here is that we took a   .  trillion gamble to save our financial systems  and you know what  it paid off. There was no inflation. Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk to print an extra     billion for aid  Would the risks really be that different  To me  it's not that clear. What is clear is the impact on aid. Even though this is the printing of just three central banks  the global aid that's given over this period is up by almost    percent. Aid as a proportion of national income all of a sudden is at a    year high. Now  we don't get to  .  percent. Governments are still incentivized to give. But you know what  that's the  point of a matching scheme. So I think what we've learned is that the risks from this money creation scheme are quite modest  but the benefits are potentially huge. Imagine what we could do with    percent more funding. We might be able to feed the front row. The thing that I fear  the only thing that I fear  apart from the fact that I've run out of time  is that the window of opportunity for this idea is a short one. Today  money creation by central banks is an accepted policy tool. That may not always be the case. Today there are universally agreed aims for international aid. That may not always be the case. Today might be the only time that these two things coincide  such that we can afford the aid that we've always aspired to give. So  can we print money for international aid  I seriously believe the question should be  why not  Thank you very much. Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies  bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars  but collections of stars  or galaxies. Now  by showing you some of these images  I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects  but more than that  I think galaxy clusters are mysterious  they are surprising  and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories  to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types  and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So  how big  Well  here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent  it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And  in fact  if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now  to give you a number  this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind boggling how  massive these systems can get. But more than their mass  they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems  so if we like  we can think of them as a scaled down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales  such as  how does gravity work  might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay  if I take an image of a galaxy cluster  and I subtract away all of the starlight  what I'm left with is this big  blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X ray light that we're seeing. And the question is  if it's not galaxies  what is emitting this light  The answer is hot gas  million degree gas    in fact  it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds  and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea  but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us  still puzzle us  and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing  probing the very small. Now  to explain this  I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something  very  very mysterious  which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that  doesn't like to interact very much  except through gravity  and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist  you want to know what happens  when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well  how do we do this  To answer that question  I'm going to have to ask another one  which is  what happens when galaxy clusters collide  Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe  scaled down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter  and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas  and  of course  you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge  huge scale. And this is very important  because what it means is that very  very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab  might be compounded and compounded into something that we could  possibly observe in nature. So  it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter  the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small  is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing  the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay  if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air  I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever increasing rate. Similarly  cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name  and they call it dark energy. And  again  we want to learn more about it. So  one particular question that we have is  how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales  Depending on how strong it is  maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well  the problem with the large scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well  I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic  the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly  I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So  as I come to a close  you might feel slightly cheated. I mean  I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful  and I've given some reasons  but what is their use really  Well  to answer this  I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say   If I had asked people what they wanted  they would have said faster horses.  Today  we as a society are faced with many  many difficult problems. And the solutions to these  problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So  yes  we need to focus  yes  we need to concentrate  but we also need to remember that innovation  ingenuity  inspiration    these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. I'm very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about how we might repair the damaged brain  and I'm particularly excited by this field  because as a neurologist myself  I believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope for patients who today live with devastating and yet untreatable diseases of the brain. So here's the problem. You can see here the picture of somebody's brain with Alzheimer's disease next to a healthy brain  and what's obvious is  in the Alzheimer's brain  ringed red  there's obvious damage    atrophy  scarring. And I could show you equivalent pictures from other disease  multiple sclerosis  motor neuron disease  Parkinson's disease  even Huntington's disease  and they would all tell a similar story. And collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time. And the numbers here are really rather staggering. At any one time  there are    million people today living with one of these brain diseases  and the annual cost globally is     billion dollars. I mean  just think about that. That's greater than one percent of the global GDP. And it gets worse  because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large age related diseases  and we're living longer. So the question we really need to ask ourselves is  why  given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual  never mind the scale of the societal problem  why are there no effective treatments  Now in order to consider this  I first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works. So in other words  I need to tell you everything I learned at medical school. But believe me  this isn't going to take very long. Okay   Laughter  So the brain is terribly simple  it's made up of four cells  and two of them are shown here. There's the nerve cell  and then there's the myelinating cell  or the insulating cell. It's called oligodendrocyte. And when these four cells work together in health and harmony  they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity  and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think  to emote  to remember  to learn  move  feel and so on. But equally  each of these individual four cells alone or together  can go rogue or die  and when that happens  you get damage. You get damaged wiring. You get disrupted connections. And that's evident here with the slower conduction. But ultimately  this damage will manifest as disease  clearly. And if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve  for example  you'll get motor neuron disease. So I'd like to give you a real life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease. So this is a patient of mine called John. John I saw just last week in the clinic. And I've asked John to tell us something  about what were his problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease. John  I was diagnosed in October in       and the main problem was a breathing problem  difficulty breathing. Siddharthan Chandran  I don't know if you caught all of that  but what John was telling us was that difficulty with breathing led eventually to the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. So John's now    months further down in that journey  and I've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament. John  What I've got now is  the breathing's gotten worse. I've got weakness in my hands   my arms and my legs. So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time. SC  John's just told us he's in a wheelchair most of the time. So what these two clips show is not just the devastating consequence of the disease  but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease  because in just    months  a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair  and respirator dependent. And let's face it  John could be anybody's father  brother or friend. So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies. But what happens when that myelin cell dies  You get multiple sclerosis. So the scan on your left is an illustration of the brain  and it's a map of the connections of the brain  and superimposed upon which are areas of damage. We call them lesions of demyelination. But they're damage  and they're white. So I know what you're thinking here. You're thinking   My God  this bloke came up and said he's going to talk about hope  and all he's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale.  I've told you these diseases are terrible. They're devastating  numbers are rising  the costs are ridiculous  and worst of all  we have no treatment. Where's the hope  Well  you know what  I think there is hope. And there's hope in this next section  of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.  because what it illustrates is  amazingly  the brain can repair itself. It just doesn't do it well enough. And so again  there are two things I want to show you. First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S. And again  it's another one of these white masses. But crucially  the area that's ringed red highlights an area that is pale blue. But that area that is pale blue was once white. So it was damaged. It's now repaired. Just to be clear  It's not because of doctors. It's in spite of doctors  not because of doctors. This is spontaneous repair. It's amazing and it's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain  even  which can enable new myelin  new insulation  to be laid down over the damaged nerves. And this observation is important for two reasons. The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school  or at least I did  admittedly last century  which is that the brain doesn't repair itself  unlike  say  the bone or the liver. But actually it does  but it just doesn't do it well enough. And the second thing it does  and it gives us a very clear direction  of travel for new therapies    I mean  you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here. You simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous  spontaneous repair that occurs anyway. So the question is  why  if we've known that for some time  as we have  why do we not have those treatments  And that in part reflects the complexity of drug development. Now  drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet  and the odds of this bet are roughly this  they're        to one against  because you need to screen about        compounds to find that one potential winner. And then you need to spend    years and spend over a billion dollars  and even then  you may not have a winner. So the question for us is  can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds  And in order to do that  you have to think  where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery  And one of the bottlenecks is  early in drug discovery. All that screening occurs in animal models. But we know that the proper  study of mankind is man  to borrow from Alexander Pope. So the question is  can we study these diseases using human material  And of course  absolutely we can. We can use stem cells  and specifically we can use human stem cells. And human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things  they can self renew or make more of themselves  but they can also become specialized to make bone  liver or  crucially  nerve cells  maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell. And the challenge has long been  can we harness the power  the undoubted power of these stem cells in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology  And I think we can now  and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last        years. One of them was here in Edinburgh  and it must be the only celebrity sheep  Dolly. So Dolly was made in Edinburgh  and Dolly was an example of the first cloning of a mammal from an adult cell. But I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in      by a Japanese scientist called Yamanaka. And what Yamaka did  in a fantastic form of scientific cookery  was he showed that four ingredients  just four ingredients  could effectively convert any cell  adult cell  into a master stem cell. And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate  because what it means that from anybody in this room  but particularly patients  you could now generate a bespoke  personalized tissue repair kit. Take a skin cell  make it a master pluripotent cell  so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease  both to study but potentially to treat. Now  the idea of that at medical school    this is a recurring theme  isn't  it  me and medical school    would have been ridiculous  but it's an absolute reality today. And I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration  repair and hope. And whilst we're on the theme of hope  for those of you who might have failed at school  there's hope for you as well  because this is the school report of John Gerdon.   I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist  on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.   So they didn't think much of him then. But what you may not know is that he  got the Nobel Prize for medicine just three months ago. So to return to the original problem  what is the opportunity of these stem cells  or this disruptive technology  for repairing the damaged brain  which we call regenerative neurology  I think there are two ways you can think about this  as a fantastic   st century drug discovery tool  and or as a form of therapy. So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments. Drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this. It's very simple  You take a patient with a disease  let's say motor neuron disease  you take a skin sample  you do the pluripotent reprogramming  as I've already told you  and you generate live motor nerve cells. That's straightforward  because that's what pluripotent cells can do. But crucially  you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts  ideally from an unaffected relative. That way  you're matching for genetic variation. And that's exactly what we did here. This was a collaboration with colleagues  in London  Chris Shaw  in the U.S.   Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis. And what you're looking at  and this is amazing  these are living  growing  motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease. It happens to be an inherited form. I mean  just imagine that. This would have been unimaginable    years ago. So apart from seeing them grow and put out processes  we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce  but crucially  we can then track their individual health and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones. And when you do all that and put it together  you realize that the diseased ones  which is represented in the red line  are two and a half times more likely to die than the healthy counterpart. And the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs  because what would you ask of the drugs  and you could do this through a high throughput automated screening system  you'd ask the drugs  give me one thing  find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line  because that drug will be a high value candidate that you could probably take direct to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that I've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models  if that makes sense. It's fantastic. But I want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage. And again there are two ways to think about this  and they're not mutually exclusive. The first  and I think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend  but it's not thought of that way just yet  is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain  and I've told you that. All of us have stem cells in the brain  even the diseased brain  and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it. That will be the future. There will be drugs that will do that. But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells  transplant them in  to replace dying or lost cells  even in the brain. And I want to tell you now an experiment  it's a clinical trial that we did  which recently completed  which is with colleagues in UCL  David Miller in particular. So this study was very simple. We took patients with multiple sclerosis and asked a simple question  Would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves  So what we did was we took this bone marrow  grew up the stem cells in the lab  and then injected them back into the vein. I'm making this sound really simple. It took five years off a lot of people  okay  And it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues. But conceptually  it's essentially simple. So we've given them into the vein  right  So in order to measure whether this was successful or not  we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure. And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.  because patients with M.S. sadly suffer with problems with vision    loss of vision  unclear vision. And so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with David Miller three times       months  six months  and before the infusion    and you can see the gently declining red line. And that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking  which makes sense  because their nerves are dying. We then gave the stem cell infusion and repeated the measurement twice    three months and six months    and to our surprise  almost  the line's gone up. That suggests that the intervention has been protective. I don't think myself that what's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves. What I think they've done is they've promoted the endogenous stem cells  or precursor cells  to do their job  wake up  lay down new myelin. So this is a proof of concept. I'm very excited about that. So I just want to end with the theme I began on  which was regeneration and hope. So here I've asked John what his hopes are for the future. John  I would hope that sometime in the future through the research that you people are doing  we can come up with a cure so that people like me can lead a normal life. SC  I mean  that speaks volumes. But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John    thanking John for allowing me to share his insights and these clips with you all. But I'd also like to add to John and to others that my own view is  I'm hopeful for the future. I do believe that the disruptive technologies like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you do offer very real hope. And I do think that the day that we might be able to repair the damaged brain is sooner than we think. Thank you. I'm going to talk about hackers. And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin  but I'm going to explain to you why it should be. The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous  or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity  or of an international rogue with a political agenda. And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of. But like most things in technology and the technology world  hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil. For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill. Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system  and it is a deeply democratic activity. It's about critical thinking. It's about questioning existing ways of doing things. It's the idea that if you see a  problem  you work to fix it  and not just complain about it. And in many ways  hacking is what built America. Betsy Ross was a hacker. The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack. And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs  hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy. So if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today  it's that the next time you think about who a hacker is  you think not of this guy but of this guy  Benjamin Franklin  who was one of the greatest hackers of all time. He was one of America's most prolific inventors  though he famously never filed a patent  because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available. He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod  and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of American democracy. And in Code For America  we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin. He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action. He believed that government could be built by the people  and we call those people civic hackers. So it's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy  like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise  are the same values that underly the Internet. And so it's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government. But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like  I want to make clear that you don't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker. You just have to believe that you can bring a   st century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces. And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects. So keep that in mind. All of you are potential civic hackers. So what does civic hacking look like  Our team last year in Honolulu  which in this case was three full time fellows who were doing a year of public service  were asked by the city to rebuild the website. And it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn't going to be possible in the few months that they had. So instead  they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website. They're looking for answers to questions  and they want to take action when they're done  which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this. So our team built Honolulu Answers  which is a super simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action. Now the site itself was easy enough to build  but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content. It would have taken the three of them a very long time  especially given that none of  them are actually from Honolulu. And so they did something that's really radical  when you think about how government is used to working. They asked citizens to write the content. So you've heard of a hack a thon. They held a write a thon  where on one Saturday afternoon    Wild pigs are a huge problem  in Honolulu  apparently. In one Saturday afternoon  they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions  but more importantly than that  they created a new way for citizens  to participate in their government. Now  I think this is a really cool story in and of itself  but it gets more awesome. On the National Day of Civic Hacking this past June in Oakland  where I live  the Code For America team in Oakland took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers and turned it into Oakland Answers  and again we held a write a thon where we took the most frequently asked questions and had citizens write the answers to them  and I got into the act. I authored this answer  and a few others. And I'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation. And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we're enabling through civic hacking  we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government. At this point  you may be wondering what city officials think of all this. They actually love it. As most of you guys know  cities are being asked every day to do more with less  and they're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems. So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting  cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government. Now I don't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon. It's happening across the globe  and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City  where earlier this year  the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills. So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House. And the contract was a two year contract for  .  million dollars. Now a lot of people were really angry about this  especially geeks who knew that  .  million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app. But instead of taking to the streets  they issued a challenge. They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper  and they offered a prize of       dollars           times cheaper than the government contract  and they gave the entrants    days. And in those    days  they submitted     apps  five of which were presented to Congress and are still in the app store today. And because of this action  that contract was vacated  and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners  Code for Mexico City. And so what you see in all three of these places  in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City  are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking. It's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them  and through that work  they're creating a   st century ecosystem of participation. They're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved  besides voting or signing a petition or protesting. They can actually build government. So back to our friend Ben Franklin  who  one of his lesser known accomplishments was that in      he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia  called a brigade. And it's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city  so in true civic hacker fashion  they built a solution. And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I've just described  and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps and come join us. We have    brigades in the U.S. We are pleased to announce today that we're opening up the  brigade to international cities for the first time  starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland. You can find out if there's a brigade where you live at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and if there's not a brigade where you live  we will help you. We've created a tool kit which also lives at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and we will support you along the way. Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems  that will support local government  and that will empower citizens. So please come hack with us. Thank you. Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies  bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars  but collections of stars  or galaxies. Now  by showing you some of these images  I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects  but more than that  I think galaxy clusters are mysterious  they are surprising  and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories  to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types  and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So  how big  Well  here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent  it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And  in fact  if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now  to give you a number  this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind boggling how  massive these systems can get. But more than their mass  they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems  so if we like  we can think of them as a scaled down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales  such as  how does gravity work  might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay  if I take an image of a galaxy cluster  and I subtract away all of the starlight  what I'm left with is this big  blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X ray light that we're seeing. And the question is  if it's not galaxies  what is emitting this light  The answer is hot gas  million degree gas    in fact  it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds  and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea  but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us  still puzzle us  and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing  probing the very small. Now  to explain this  I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something  very  very mysterious  which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that  doesn't like to interact very much  except through gravity  and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist  you want to know what happens  when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well  how do we do this  To answer that question  I'm going to have to ask another one  which is  what happens when galaxy clusters collide  Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe  scaled down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter  and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas  and  of course  you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge  huge scale. And this is very important  because what it means is that very  very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab  might be compounded and compounded into something that we could  possibly observe in nature. So  it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter  the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small  is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing  the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay  if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air  I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever increasing rate. Similarly  cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name  and they call it dark energy. And  again  we want to learn more about it. So  one particular question that we have is  how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales  Depending on how strong it is  maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well  the problem with the large scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well  I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic  the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly  I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So  as I come to a close  you might feel slightly cheated. I mean  I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful  and I've given some reasons  but what is their use really  Well  to answer this  I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say   If I had asked people what they wanted  they would have said faster horses.  Today  we as a society are faced with many  many difficult problems. And the solutions to these  problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So  yes  we need to focus  yes  we need to concentrate  but we also need to remember that innovation  ingenuity  inspiration    these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. Almost two years ago  I was driving in my car in Germany  and I turned on the radio. Europe at the time was in the middle of the Euro crisis  and all the headlines were about European countries getting downgraded by rating agencies in the United States. I listened and thought to myself   What are these rating agencies  and why is everybody so upset about their work   Well  if you were sitting next to me in the car that day and would have told me that I would devote the next years to trying to reform them  obviously I would have called you crazy. But guess what's really crazy  the way these rating agencies are run. And I would like to explain to you not only why it's time to change this  but also how we can do it. So let me tell you a little bit about what rating agencies really do. As you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get  investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money. A rating can range from a so called AAA  which means it's a top performing product  and it can go down to the level of the so called BBB   which means it's a fairly risky investment. Rating agencies are rating companies. They are rating banks. They are rating even financial products like the infamous mortgage backed securities. But they can also rate countries  and these ratings are called sovereign ratings  and I would like to focus in particular on these sovereign ratings. And I can tell  as you're listening to me right now  you're thinking  so why should I really care about this  right  Be honest. Well  ratings affect you. They affect all of us. If a rating agency rates a country  it basically assesses and evaluates a country's debt and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt. So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency  the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets. So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer  because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow. But what if a country can't afford to pay more because it's maybe too expensive  Well  then the country has less available for other services  like roads  schools  healthcare. And this is the reason why you should care  because sovereign ratings affect everyone. And that is the reason why I believe they should be defined as public goods. They should be transparent  accessible  and available to everyone at no cost. But here's the situation  the rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players only    Standard   Poor's  Moody's  and Fitch    and we know whenever there is a market concentration  there is really no competition. There is no incentive to improve the quality of your product. And let's face it  the credit rating  agencies have contributed  putting the global economy on the brink  and yet they have to change the way they operate. The second point  would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer  Obviously not  right  That would be irresponsible. But that's actually what's going on in the rating agency sector every single day. The customers of these rating agencies  like countries or companies  they are paying for their own ratings  and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest. The third point is  the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings  but in this day and age  you can't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that's inside. But for ratings  a crucial element of our economy  we really do not know what all the different ingredients are. We are allowing the rating agencies to be intransparent about their work  and we need to change this. I think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul  not just a trimming at the margins. I think it's time for a bold move. I think it's time to upgrade the system. And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation have invested a lot of time and effort thinking about an alternative for the sector. And we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk  and we call it by its acronym  INCRA. INCRA would make a difference to the current system by adding another nonprofit player to the mix. It would be based on a nonprofit model that would be based on a sustainable endowment. The endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation  to run the rating agency  and it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available. But this is not enough to make a difference  right  INCRA would also be based on a very  very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest  and it would include many stakeholders from society. INCRA would not only be a European or an American rating agency  it would be a truly international one  in which  in particular  the emerging economies would have an equal interest   voice and representation. The second big difference that INCRA would make is that would it base its sovereign risk assessment on a broader set of indicators. Think about it that way. If we conduct a sovereign rating  we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country  its macroeconomic fundamentals. But we also have to ask the question  who is cultivating the economic soil of a country  right  Well  a country has many gardeners  and one of them is the government  so we have to ask the question  how is a country governed  How is it managed  And this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward looking indicators. These are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country. I hope you would agree it's important for you to know if your government is willing to invest  in renewable energy and education. It's important for you to know if the government of your country is able to manage a crisis  if the government is finally able to implement the reforms that it's promised. For example  if INCRA would rate South Africa right now  of course we would take a very  very close look at the youth unemployment of the country  the highest in the world. If over    percent of a country's population under the age of    is unemployed  of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future. Well  our friends at Moody's  Standard   Poor's  and Fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well. But guess what  We do not know exactly how they will take this into account. And this leads me to the third big difference that INCRA would make. INCRA would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology. So in contrast to the current system  INCRA would be fully transparent. So in a nutshell  INCRA would offer an alternative to the current system of the big three rating agencies by adding a new  nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition  it would increase the transparency of the sector  and it would also increase the quality. I can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world  but I tell you it's a very important one  and a very important one to fix  because sovereign ratings affect all of us  and they should be addressed and should be defined as public goods. And this is why we are testing our model right now  and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and willing actors to bring INCRA to life. I truly believe building up INCRA is in everyone's interest  and that we have the unique opportunity right now to turn INCRA into a cornerstone of a new  more inclusive financial system. Because for way too long  we have left the big financial players on their own. It's time to give them some company. Thank you. I had brain surgery    years ago  and since that time  brain science has become a personal passion of mine. I'm actually an engineer. And first let me say  I recently joined Google's Moonshot group  where I had a division  the display division in Google X  and the brain science work I'm speaking about today is work I did before I joined Google and on the side outside of Google. So that said  there's a stigma when you have brain surgery. Are you still smart or not  And if not  can you make yourself smart again  After my neurosurgery  part of my brain was missing  and I had to deal with that. It wasn't the grey matter  but it  was the gooey part dead center that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters. Immediately after my surgery  I had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day  because if I just took nothing  I would die within hours. Every day now for    years    every single day    I've had to try to decide the combinations and mixtures of chemicals  and try to get them  to stay alive. There have been several close calls. But luckily  I'm an experimentalist at heart  so I decided I would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really isn't a clear road map on this that's detailed. I began to try different mixtures  and I was blown away by how tiny changes in dosages dramatically changed my sense of self  my sense of who I was  my thinking  my behavior towards people. One particularly dramatic case  for a couple months I actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early   s  and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed. I was angry all the time  I thought about sex constantly  and I thought I was the smartest person in the entire world  and   Laughter   of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that  or maybe kind of toned down versions of that. I was kind of extreme. But to me  the surprise was  I wasn't trying to be arrogant. I was actually trying  with a little bit of insecurity  to actually fix a problem in front of me  and it just didn't come out that way. So I couldn't handle it. I changed my dosages. But that experience  I think  gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through  and I've gotten along with men a lot better since then. What I was trying to do with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery  my creative thought  my idea flow. And I think mostly in images  and so for me that became a key metric    how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping  if you will  my ideas  trying on different new ideas for size  playing out scenarios. This kind of thinking isn't new. Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes saw things similarly. They thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing. There are those today that dispute that  and lots of debates about how the mind works  but for me it's simple  Mental images  for most of us  are central in inventive and creative thinking. So after several years  I tuned myself up and I have lots of great  really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them. And so now I'm working on  how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster  Can you imagine  if you will  a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her  Or a musician to get the music out of his head  There are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed. And the truth is  the remaining bottleneck in being able to do this is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems. So let me show you why I think  we're pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups. Both used fMRI technology    functional magnetic resonance imaging technology    to image the brain  and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis and his colleagues at Harvard. And the left hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image. The middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining  seeing that same image. And the right column was created by subtracting the middle  column from the left column  showing the difference to be nearly zero. This was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images  always with a similar result. The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing. Next let me share with you one other experiment  this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley. They've been able to decode brainwaves into recognizable visual fields. So let me set this up for you. In this experiment  individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reacting to video sequences. Then a new movie was shown with new images  new people  new animals in it  and a new scan set was recorded. The computer  using brain scan data alone  decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the  individual was actually seeing. On the right hand side  you see the computer's guess  and on the left hand side  the presented clip. This is the jaw dropper. We are so close to being able to do this. We just need to up the resolution. And now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image  it creates the same brain scan. So this was done with the highest resolution brain scan systems available today  and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years. Next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse. How do we do that  There's a lot of techniques in this approach. One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes. I'm not for that. There's a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed  some even by me  but given the recent success of MRI  first we need to ask the question  is it the end of the road with this technology  Conventional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets  but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements  not the thousandfold we need. I'm putting forward an idea  instead of bigger magnets  let's make better magnets. There's some new technology breakthroughs in nanoscience when applied to magnetic structures that have created a whole new class of magnets  and with these magnets  we can lay down very fine detailed magnetic field patterns throughout the brain  and using those  we can actually create holographic like interference structures to get precision control over many patterns  as is shown here by shifting things. We can create much more complicated structures with slightly different arrangements  kind of like making Spirograph. So why does that matter  A lot of effort in MRI over the years has gone into making really big  really huge magnets  right  But yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers in the MRI systems. Let's also  instead of a uniform magnetic field  put down structured magnetic patterns in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies. So by combining the magnetics patterns with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies processing which can massively increase the information that we can extract in a single scan. And on top of that  we can then layer our ever growing knowledge  of brain structure and memory to create a thousandfold increase that we need. And using fMRI  we should be able to measure not just oxygenated blood flow  but the hormones and neurotransmitters  I've talked about and maybe even the direct neural activity  which is the dream. We're going to be able to dump our ideas directly to digital media. Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought  What would we be capable of then  And how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought  You think the Internet was big. These are huge questions. It might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills. And indeed  this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar diseases. We have little option but to open this door. Regardless  pick a year    will it happen in five years or    years  It's hard to imagine it taking much longer. We need to learn how to take this step together. Thank you. I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy and its relationship with technology. We tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic thought  perhaps rather timeless. I'm going to argue that  in fact  business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology  that those assumptions are changing  and  in fact  changing quite dramatically  and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy. Let me start  if I may  with a little bit of history. The idea of strategy in business owes its origins to two intellectual giants  Bruce Henderson  the founder of BCG  and Michael Porter  professor at the Harvard Business School. Henderson's central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness  of overwhelming the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that  in the business world  there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns    scale  experience. The more you do of something  disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. Porter agreed with that premise  but he qualified it. He pointed out  correctly  that that's all very well  but businesses actually have multiple steps to them. They have different components  and each of those components might be driven by a different kind of strategy. A company or a business might actually be advantaged in some activities but disadvantaged in others. He formed the concept of the value chain  essentially the sequence of steps with which a  shall we say  raw material  becomes a component  becomes assembled into a finished product  and then is distributed  for example  and he argued that advantage accrued to each of those components  and that the advantage of the whole was in some sense the sum or the average of that of its parts. And this idea of the value chain was predicated on the recognition that what holds a business together is transaction costs  that in essence you need to coordinate  organizations are more efficient at coordination than markets  very often  and therefore the nature and role and boundaries of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs. It was on those two ideas  Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience  and Porter's idea of the value chain  encompassing heterogenous elements  that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected. Now what I'm going to argue is that those premises are  in fact  being invalidated. First of all  let's think about transaction costs. There are really two components to transaction costs. One is about processing information  and the other is about communication. These are the economics of processing and communicating as they have evolved over a long period of time. As we all know from so many contexts  they have been radically transformed since the days when Porter and Henderson first formulated their theories. In particular  since the mid '  s  communications costs have actually been falling even faster than transaction costs  which is why communication  the Internet  has exploded in such a dramatic fashion. Now  those falling transaction costs have profound consequences  because if transaction costs are the glue that hold value chains together  and they are falling  there is less to economize on. There is less need for vertically integrated organization  and value chains at least can break up. They needn't necessarily  but they can. In particular  it then becomes possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate the competitor in another. That is not just an abstract proposition. There are many very specific stories of how that actually happened. A poster child example was the encyclopedia business. The encyclopedia business in the days of leatherbound books was basically a distribution business. Most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen. The CD ROM and then the Internet came along  new technologies made the distribution of knowledge many orders of magnitude cheaper  and the encyclopedia industry collapsed. It's now  of course  a very familiar story. This  in fact  more generally was the story of the first generation of the Internet economy. It was about falling transaction costs breaking up value chains and therefore allowing disintermediation  or what we call deconstruction. One of the questions I was occasionally asked was  well  what's going to replace the encyclopedia when Britannica no longer has a business model  And it was a while before the answer became manifest. Now  of course  we know what it is  it's the Wikipedia. Now what's special about the Wikipedia is not its distribution. What's special about the Wikipedia is the way it's produced. The Wikipedia  of course  is an encyclopedia created by its users. And this  in fact  defines what you might call the second decade of the Internet economy  the decade in which the Internet as a noun became the Internet as a verb. It became a set of conversations  the era in which user generated content and social networks became the dominant phenomenon. Now what that really meant in terms of the Porter Henderson framework was the collapse of certain kinds of economies of scale. It turned out that tens of thousands of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia could do just as good a job  and certainly a much cheaper job  than professionals in a hierarchical organization. So basically what was happening was that one layer of this value chain was becoming fragmented  as individuals could take over where organizations were no longer needed. But there's another question that obviously this graph poses  which is  okay  we've gone through two decades    does anything distinguish the third  And what I'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third  and it maps exactly on to the kind of Porter Henderson logic that we've been talking about. And that is  about data. If we go back to around       a lot of people were talking about the information revolution  and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data was growing  indeed growing quite fast. but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog. We go forward to       not only had the world's stock of data exploded  but there'd been this massive substitution of digital for analog. And more important even than that  if you look more carefully at this graph  what you will observe is that about a half of that digital data is information that has an I.P. address. It's on a server or it's on a P.C. But having an I.P. address means that it can be connected to any other data that has an I.P. address. It means it becomes possible to put together half of the world's knowledge in order to see patterns  an entirely new thing. If we run the numbers forward to today  it probably looks something like this. We're not really sure. If we run the numbers forward to       we of course have an exact number  courtesy of IDC. It's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present. And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication in the stock of information that is connected via an I.P. address. Now  if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs of data points  a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data is a ten thousandfold multiplication in the number of patterns that we can see in that data  this just in the last    or    years. This  I would submit  is a sea change  a profound change in the economics of the world that we live in. The first human genome  that of James Watson  was mapped as the culmination of the Human Genome Project in the year       and it took about     million dollars and about    years of work to map just one person's genomic makeup. Since then  the costs of mapping the genome have come down. In fact  they've come down in recent years very dramatically indeed  to the point where the cost  is now below       dollars  and it's confidently predicted that by the year      it will be below     dollars    a five or six order of magnitude drop in the cost of genomic mapping in just a    year period  an extraordinary phenomenon. Now  in the days when mapping a genome cost millions  or even tens of thousands  it was basically a research enterprise. Scientists would gather some representative people  and they would see patterns  and they would try and make generalizations about human nature and disease from the abstract patterns they find from these particular selected individuals. But when the genome can  be mapped for     bucks     dollars while you wait  then what happens is  it becomes retail. It becomes above all clinical. You go the doctor with a cold  and if he or she hasn't done it already  the first thing they do is map your genome  at which point what they're now doing is not starting from some abstract  knowledge of genomic medicine and trying to work out how it applies to you  but they're starting from your particular genome. Now think of the power of that. Think of where that takes us when we can combine genomic data with clinical data with data about drug interactions with the kind of ambient data that devices like our phone and medical sensors will increasingly be collecting. Think what happens when we collect all of that data and we can put it together in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before. This  I would suggest  perhaps it will take a while  but this will drive a revolution in medicine. Fabulous  lots of people talk about this. But there's one thing that doesn't get much attention. How is that model of colossal sharing across all of those kinds of databases compatible with the business models of institutions and organizations and corporations that are involved in this business today  If your business is based on proprietary data  if your competitive advantage is defined by your data  how on Earth is that company or is that society in fact going to achieve the value that's implicit in the technology  They can't. So essentially what's happening here  and genomics is merely one example of this  is that technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity beyond the institutional boundaries within which we have been used to thinking about it  and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries in terms of which business strategy as a discipline is formulated. The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated  oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving  by one means or another  from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening  It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together  and allows them to separate. The polarization of scale economies towards the very small    small is beautiful    allows for scalable communities to substitute for conventional corporate production. The scaling in the opposite direction  towards things like big data  drive the structure of business towards the creation of new kinds of institutions that can achieve that scale. But either way  the typically vertical structure gets driven to becoming more horizontal. The logic isn't just about big data. If we were to look  for example  at the telecommunications industry  you can tell the same story about fiber optics. If we look at the pharmaceutical industry  or  for that matter  university research  you can say exactly the same story about so called  big science.  And in the opposite direction  if we look  say  at the energy sector  where all the talk is about how households will be efficient producers of green energy and efficient conservers of energy  that is  in fact  the reverse phenomenon. That is the fragmentation of scale because the very small can substitute for the traditional corporate scale. Either way  what we are driven to is this horizontalization of the structure of industries  and that implies fundamental changes in how we think about strategy. It means  for example  that we need to think about strategy as the curation of these kinds of horizontal structure  where things like business definition and even industry definition are actually the outcomes of strategy  not something that the strategy presupposes. It means  for example  we need to work out how to accommodate collaboration and competition simultaneously. Think about the genome. We need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously. And we need industry structures that will accommodate very  very different motivations  from the amateur motivations of people in communities to maybe the social motivations of infrastructure built by governments  or  for that matter  cooperative institutions built by companies that are otherwise competing  because that is the only way that they can get to scale. These kinds of transformations render the traditional premises  of business strategy obsolete. They drive us into a completely new world. They require us  whether we are in the public sector or the private sector  to think very fundamentally differently about the structure of business  and  at last  it makes strategy interesting again. Thank you. The      Arab Spring captured the attention of the world. It also captured the attention of authoritarian governments in other countries  who were worried that revolution would spread. To respond  they ramped up surveillance of activists  journalists and dissidents who they feared would inspire revolution in their own countries. One prominent Bahraini activist  who was arrested and tortured by his government  has said that the interrogators showed him transcripts of his telephone calls and text messages. Of course  it's no secret that governments are able to intercept telephone calls and text messages. It's for that reason that many activists specifically avoid using the telephone. Instead  they use tools like Skype  which they think are immune to interception. They're wrong. There have now been over the last few years an industry of companies who provide surveillance technology to governments  specifically technology that allows those governments to hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Rather than intercepting the communications  as they go over the wire  instead they now hack into your computer  enable your webcam  enable your microphone  and steal documents from your computer. When the government of Egypt fell in       activists raided the office of the secret police  and among the many documents they found was this document by the Gamma Corporation  by Gamma International. Gamma is a German company that manufactures surveillance software and sells it only to governments. It's important to note that most governments don't really have the in house capabilities to develop this software. Smaller ones don't have the resources or the expertise  and so there's this market of Western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price. Gamma is just one of these companies. I should note also that Gamma never actually sold their software to the Egyptian government. They'd sent them an invoice for a sale  but the Egyptians never bought it. Instead  apparently  the Egyptian government used a free demo version of Gamma's software. So this screenshot is from a sales video that Gamma produced. Really  they're just emphasizing in a relatively slick presentation the fact that the police can sort of sit in an air conditioned office and remotely monitor someone without them having any idea that it's going on. You know  your webcam light won't turn on. There's nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled. This is the managing director of Gamma International. His name is Martin Muench. There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist. This is perhaps my favorite. I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam. You can see there's a little sticker that's placed over his camera. He knows what kind of surveillance is possible  and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used against him. Muench has said that he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles. Of course  he's also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments  he has no way of knowing how it can be used. Gamma's software has been located on servers in countries around the world  many with really atrocious track records and human rights violations. They really are selling their software around the world. Gamma is not the only company in the business. As I said  it's a    billion industry. One of the other big guys in the industry is an Italian company called Hacking Team. Now  Hacking Team has what is probably the slickest presentation. The video they've produced is very sexy  and so I'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it's marketed to their government clients. You have to hack your target.   While your target is browsing the web  exchanging documents  receiving SMS  crossing the borders   You have to hit many different platforms.   Windows  OS X  iOS  Android  Blackberry  Symbian  Linux   You have to overcome encryption and capture relevant data.  Skype   encrypted calls  target location   messaging  relationships  web browsing  audio   video   Being stealth and untraceable.   Immune to any protection system Hidden collection infrastructure   Deployed all over your country.   Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot   Exactly what we do. Christopher Soghoian  So  it would be funny if it wasn't true  but  in fact  Hacking Team's software is being sold to governments around the world. Last year we learned  for example  that it's been used to target Moroccan  journalists by the Moroccan government. Many  many countries it's been found in. So  Hacking Team has also been actively courting the U.S. law enforcement market. In the last year or so  the company has opened a sales office in Maryland. The company has also hired a spokesperson. They've been attending surveillance industry conferences where law enforcement officials show up. They've spoken at the conferences. What I thought was most fascinating was they've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year. I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team has sold their technology in the United States  but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it  it isn't because they haven't been trying hard. So as I said before  governments that don't really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off the shelf surveillance software  and so for that reason  you see that the government of  say  Tunisia  might use the same software as the government of Germany. They're all buying off the shelf stuff. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States does have the budget to build their own surveillance technology  and so for several years  I've been trying to figure out if and how the FBI is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets. My friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation    they're a civil society group   obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies. Most of these documents were heavily redacted  but what you can see from the slides  if I zoom in  is this term  Remote Operations Unit. Now  when I first looked into this  I'd never heard of this unit before. I've been studying surveillance for more than six years. I'd never heard of it. And so I went online and I did some research  and ultimately I hit the mother lode when I went to LinkedIn  the social networking site for job seekers. There were lots of former U.S. government contractors who had at one point worked for the Remote Operating Unit  and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs what they had done in their former job. So I took this information and I gave it to a journalist that I know and trust at the Wall Street Journal  and she was able to contact several other former law enforcement officials who spoke on background and confirmed that yes  in fact  the FBI has a dedicated team that does nothing but hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Like Gamma and Hacking Team  the FBI also has the capability to remotely activate webcams  microphones  steal documents  get web browsing information  the works. There's sort of a big problem with governments going into hacking  and that's that terrorists  pedophiles  drug dealers  journalists and human rights activists all use the same kinds of computers. There's no drug dealer phone and there's no journalist laptop. We all use the same technology  and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys  they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too. So governments around the world have been embracing this technology. They've been embracing hacking as a law enforcement technique  but without any real debate. In the United States  where I live  there have been no congressional hearings. There's no law that's been passed specifically authorizing this technique  and because of its power and potential for abuse  it's vital that we have an informed public debate. Thank you very much. This is a vending machine in Los Angeles. It's in a shopping mall  and it sells fish eggs. It's a caviar vending machine. This is the Art o mat  an art vending machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists  usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes  in limited edition. This is Oliver Medvedik. He's not a vending machine  but he is one of the founders of Genspace  a community biolab in Brooklyn  New York  where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry DNA. In fact  I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions about a year ago  and this is what led me onto this bizarre path that I'm going to talk to you right now. Because strawberry DNA is really  fascinating  because it's so beautiful. I'd never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before  before I saw it in this form. And a lot of people  especially in the art community  don't necessarily engage in science in this way. I instantly joined Genspace after this  and I asked Oliver   Well  if we can do this strawberries  can we do this with people as well   And about    minutes later  we were both spinning it in vials together and coming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction. And I started doing this on my own  and this is what my DNA actually looks like. And I was at a dinner party with some friends  some artist friends  and I was telling them about this project  and they couldn't believe that you could actually see DNA. So I said  all right  let's get out some supplies right now. And I started having these bizarre dinner  parties at my house on Friday nights where people would come over and we would do DNA extractions  and I would actually capture them on video  because it created this kind of funny portrait as well. These are people who don't necessarily regularly engage with science whatsoever. You can kind of tell from their reactions. But they became fascinated by it  and it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science. And so I started doing this regularly. It's kind of an odd thing to do with your Friday nights  but this is what I started doing  and I started collecting a whole group of my friends' DNA in small vials and categorizing them. This is what that looked like. And it started to make me think about a couple of things. First of all  this looked a lot like my Facebook wall. So in a way  I've created sort of a genetic network  a genetic social network  really. And the second thing was  one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like   Oh. Why are they numbered  Is this person more rare than the other one   And I hadn't even thought about that. They were just numbered because that was the order that I extracted the DNA in. But that made me think about collecting toys  and this thing that's going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys  and being able to collect these rare toys. You buy these boxes. You're not sure what's going to be inside of them. But then  when you open them up  you have different rarities of the toys. And so I thought that was interesting. I started thinking about this and the caviar vending machine and the Art o mat all together  and some reason  I was one night drawing a vending machine  thinking about doing paintings of a vending machine  and the little vial of my DNA was sitting there  and I saw this kind of beautiful collaboration between the strands of DNA and the coils of a vending machine. And so  of course  I decided to create an art installation called the DNA Vending Machine. Here it is.   DNA Vending Machine is an art installation about our increasing access to biotechnology.     For a reasonable cost  you can purchase a sample of human DNA from a traditional vending machine.     Each sample comes packaged with a collectible limited edition portrait of the human specimen.     DNA Vending Machine treats DNA as a collectible material and brings to light legal issues over the ownership of DNA.   Gabriel Garcia Colombo  So the DNA Vending Machine is currently in a couple galleries in New York  and it's selling out pretty well  actually. We're in the first edition of     pieces  hoping to do another edition pretty soon. I'd actually like to get it into more of a metro hub  like Grand Central or Penn Station  right next to some of the other  actual  vending machines in that location. But really with this project and a lot of my art projects I want to ask the audience a question  and that is  when biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as  say  laser cutting or  D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine  will you still submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine  And how much will these samples be worth  And will you buy someone else's sample  And what will you be able to do with that sample  Thank you. The year is     . A curious little invention is being talked about. It's called a microscope. What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye. Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases. Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup  not very far from here. This is from London. Fast forward     years. We still have this monster soup around  and it's taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt. Just for malaria itself  there are a million deaths a year  and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections. Now it's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters. You take a stain  like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa  and a microscope  and you look at them. They all have faces. Why is that so  that Alex in Kenya  Fatima in Bangladesh  Navjoot in Mumbai  and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick  And that's primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach. And remember that number  one billion. The problem lies with the microscope itself. Even though the pinnacle of modern science  research microscopes are not designed for field testing. Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all. They are heavy  bulky  really hard to maintain  and cost a lot of money. This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '  s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram in Sevagram in India. Two of my students  Jim and James  traveled around India and Thailand  starting to think about this problem a lot. We saw all kinds of donated equipment. We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses. And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn't know how to even turn it on. What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes. So what is a Foldscope  A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope  a platform for fluorescence  bright field  polarization  projection  all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper. So  now you think  how is that possible  I'm going to show you some examples here  and we will run through some of them. It starts with a single sheet of paper. What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright field and fluorescence microscope. So  there are three stages  There is the optical stage  the illumination stage and the mask holding stage. And there are micro optics at the bottom that's actually embedded in the paper itself. What you do is  you take it on  and just like you are playing like a toy  which it is  I tab it off  and I break it off. This paper has no instructions and no languages. There is a code  a color code embedded  that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope. When it's done  it looks something like this  has all the functionalities of a standard microscope  just like an XY stage  a place where a sample slide could go  for example right here. We didn't want to change this  because this is the standard that's been optimized for over the years  and many health workers are actually used to this. So this is what changes  but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases. You pop this in. There is an XY stage  and then there is a focusing stage  which is a flexure mechanism that's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps. So what's really interesting about this object  and my students hate when I do this  but I'm going to do this anyway  is these are rugged devices. I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it. And they last  even though they're designed from a very flexible material  like paper. Another fun fact is  this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool  but here in this envelope I have    different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder. And I'm going to pick one randomly. This one  it turns out  is actually designed specifically for malaria  because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria. So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this. So up till now  you didn't actually see what I would see from one of these setups. So what I would like to do is  if we could dim the lights  please  it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes. I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn    go to the back of the wall    and just project  and this way you will see exactly what I would see. What you're looking at    This is a cross section of a compound eye  and when I'm going to zoom in closer  right there  I am going through the z axis. You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross section pattern. Another example  one of my favorite insects  I love to hate this one  is a mosquito  and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens. Right there. All from the simple setup that I actually described. So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer. So it turns out they're waterproof  and    right here is just fluorescent water  and I don't know if you can actually see this. This also shows you how  the projection scope works. You get to see the beam the  way it's projected and bent. Can we get the lights back on again  So I'm quickly going to show you  since I'm running out of time  in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture  the biggest idea was roll to roll manufacturing  so we built this out of    cents of parts and costs. And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy  which we call use and throw microscopy. I'm going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in. Here is a sheet of paper. This is when we were thinking about the idea. This is an A  sheet of paper. These are the three stages that you actually see. And the optical components  if you look at the inset up on the right  we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs  so it uses a process of self assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself. So that's where the lenses go. There are some light sources. And essentially  in the end  all the parts line up because of origami  because of the fact that origami allows us micron scale precision of optical alignment. So even though this looks like a simple toy  the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated. So here is another obvious thing that we would do  typically  if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust  is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself. There it is  and it survives. So for us  the next step actually is really finishing our field trials. We are starting at the end of the summer. We are at a stage where we'll be  making thousands of microscopes. That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place. We've started collecting data for malaria  Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves. And I want to leave you with this picture. I had not anticipated this before  but a really interesting link between hands on science education and global health. What are the tools that we're actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow  I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets. Thank you. I work with children with autism. Specifically  I make technologies to help them communicate. Now  many of the problems that children with autism face  they have a common source  and that source is that they find it difficult to understand abstraction  symbolism. And because of this  they have  a lot of difficulty with language. Let me tell you a little bit about why this is. You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup. All of us can see it. All of us understand this. These are two other pictures of soup  but you can see that these are more abstract These are not quite as concrete. And when you get to language  you see that it becomes a word whose look  the way it looks and the way it sounds  has absolutely nothing to do  with what it started with  or what it represents  which is the bowl of soup. So it's essentially a completely abstract  a completely arbitrary representation of something which is in the real world  and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount of difficulty with. Now that's why most of the people  that work with children with autism    speech therapists  educators    what they do is  they try to help children with autism communicate not with words  but with pictures. So if a child with autism wanted to say   I want soup   that child would pick three different pictures   I    want   and  soup   and they would put these together  and then the therapist or the parent would understand that this is what the kid wants to say. And this has been incredibly effective  for the last        years people have been doing this. In fact  a few years back  I developed an app for the iPad which does exactly this. It's called Avaz  and the way it works is that kids select different pictures. These pictures are sequenced together to form sentences  and these sentences are spoken out. So Avaz is essentially converting pictures  it's a translator  it converts pictures into speech. Now  this was very effective. There are thousands of children using this  you know  all over the world  and I started thinking about what it does and what it doesn't do. And I realized something interesting  Avaz helps children with autism learn words. What it doesn't help them do is to learn word patterns. Let me explain this in a little more detail. Take this sentence   I want soup tonight.  Now it's not just the words here that convey the meaning. It's also the way in which these words are arranged  the way these words are modified and arranged. And that's why a sentence like  I want soup tonight  is different from a sentence like  Soup want I tonight   which  is completely meaningless. So there is another hidden abstraction here which children with autism find a lot of difficulty coping with  and that's the fact that you can modify words and you can arrange them to have different meanings  to convey different ideas. Now  this is what we call grammar. And grammar is incredibly powerful  because grammar is this one component of language which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information  an infinite amount of ideas. It's the way in which you can put things together in order to convey anything you want to. And so after I developed Avaz  I worried for a very long time about how I could give grammar  to children with autism. The solution came to me from a very interesting perspective. I happened to chance upon a child with autism conversing with her mom  and this is what happened. Completely out of the blue  very spontaneously  the child got up and said   Eat.  Now what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions. So she asked   Eat what  Do  you want to eat ice cream  You want to eat  Somebody else wants to eat  You want to eat cream now  You want to eat ice cream in the evening   And then it struck me that what the mother had done was something incredible. She had been able to get that child to communicate an idea to her without grammar. And it struck me that maybe this is what I was looking for. Instead of arranging words in an order  in sequence  as a sentence  you arrange them in this map  where they're all linked together not by placing them one after the other but in questions  in question answer pairs. And so if you do this  then what you're conveying is not a sentence in English  but what you're conveying is really a meaning  the meaning of a sentence in English. Now  meaning is really the underbelly  in some sense  of language. It's what comes after thought but before language. And the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form. So I was very excited by this  you know  hopping around all over the place  trying to figure out if I can convert all possible sentences that I hear into this. And I found that this is not enough. Why is this not enough  This is not enough because if you wanted to convey something like negation  you want to say   I don't want soup   then you can't do that by asking a question. You do that by changing the word  want.  Again  if you wanted to say   I wanted soup yesterday   you do that by converting the word  want  into  wanted.  It's a past tense. So this is a flourish which I added to make the system complete. This is a map of words joined together as questions and answers  and with these filters applied on top of them in order to modify them to represent certain nuances. Let me show you this with a different example. Let's take this sentence   I told the carpenter I could not pay him.  It's a fairly complicated sentence. The way that this particular system works  you can start with any part of this sentence. I'm going to start with the word  tell.  So this is the word  tell.  Now this happened in the past  so I'm going to make that  told.  Now  what I'm going to do is  I'm going to ask questions. So  who told  I told. I told whom  I told the carpenter. Now we start with a different part of the sentence. We start with the word  pay   and we add the ability filter to it to make it  can pay.  Then we make it  can't pay   and we can make it  couldn't pay  by making it the past tense. So who couldn't pay  I couldn't pay. Couldn't pay whom  I couldn't pay the carpenter. And then you join these two together by asking this question  What did I tell the carpenter  I told the carpenter I could not pay him. Now think about this. This is   Applause   this is a representation of this sentence without language. And there are two or three interesting things about this. First of all  I could have started anywhere. I didn't have to start with the word  tell.  I could have started anywhere in the sentence  and I could have made this entire thing. The second thing is  if I wasn't an English speaker  if I was speaking in some other language  this map would actually hold true in any language. So long as the questions are standardized  the map is actually independent of language. So I call this FreeSpeech  and I was playing with this for many  many months. I was trying out so many different combinations of this. And then I noticed something very interesting about FreeSpeech. I was trying to convert language  convert sentences in English into sentences in FreeSpeech  and vice versa  and back and forth. And I realized that this particular configuration  this particular way of representing language  it allowed me to actually create very concise rules that go between FreeSpeech on one side and English on the other. So I could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into English. And so I developed this thing. I developed this thing called  the FreeSpeech Engine which takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input and gives out perfectly grammatical English text. And by putting these two pieces together  the representation and the engine  I was able to create an app  a technology for children with autism  that not only gives them words but also gives them grammar. So I tried this out with kids with autism  and I found that there was an  incredible amount of identification. They were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech which were much more complicated but much more effective than equivalent sentences in English  and I started thinking about why that might be the case. And I had an idea  and I want to  talk to you about this idea next. In about       about    years back  there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language  and they found something very interesting. They found that when you learn a language as a child  as a two year old  you learn it with a certain part of your brain  and when you learn a language as an adult    for example  if I wanted to learn Japanese right now   a completely different part of my brain is used. Now I don't know why that's the case  but my guess is that that's because when you learn a language as an adult  you almost invariably learn it through your native language  or through your first language. So what's interesting about FreeSpeech is that when you create a sentence or when you create language  a child with autism creates language with FreeSpeech  they're not using this support language  they're not using this bridge language. They're directly constructing the sentence. And so this gave me this idea. Is it possible to use FreeSpeech not for children with autism but to teach language to people without disabilities  And so I tried a number of experiments. The first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle in which these questions and answers are coded in the form of shapes  in the form of colors  and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works. And I built an app out of it  a game out of it  in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement  a sound reinforcement of visual structures  they're able to learn language. And this  this has a lot of potential  a lot of promise  and the government of India recently licensed this technology from us  and they're going to try it out with millions of different children trying to teach them English. And the dream  the hope  the vision  really  is that when they learn English this way  they learn it with the same proficiency as their mother tongue. All right  let's talk about something else. Let's talk about speech. This is speech. So speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us. Now what's interesting about speech is that speech is one dimensional. Why is it one dimensional  It's one dimensional because it's sound. It's also one dimensional because our mouths are built that way. Our mouths are built to create one dimensional sound. But if you think about the brain  the thoughts that we have in our heads are not one dimensional. I mean  we have these rich  complicated  multi dimensional ideas. Now  it seems to me that language is really the brain's invention to convert this rich  multi dimensional thought on one hand into speech on the other hand. Now what's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays  and almost all of that is done in the language domain. Take Google  for example. Google trawls all these countless billions of websites  all of which are in English  and when you want to use Google  you go into Google search  and you type in English  and it matches the English with the English. What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead  I have a suspicion that if we did this  we'd find that algorithms like searching  like retrieval  all of these things  are much simpler and also more effective  because they don't process the data structure of speech. Instead they're processing the data structure of thought. The data structure of thought. That's a provocative idea. But let's look at this in a little more detail. So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem. We have the Free Speech representation on one side  and we have the FreeSpeech  Engine  which generates English. Now if you think about it  FreeSpeech  I told you  is completely  language independent. It doesn't have any specific information in it which is about English. So everything that this system knows about English is actually encoded into the engine. That's a pretty interesting concept in itself. You've encoded an entire human language into a software program. But if you look at what's inside the engine  it's actually not very complicated. It's not very complicated code. And what's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really English specific. And that gives this interesting idea. It might be very easy for us to actually create these engines in many  many different languages  in Hindi  in French  in German  in Swahili. And that gives another interesting idea. For example  supposing I was a writer  say  for a newspaper or for a magazine. I could create content in one language  FreeSpeech  and the person who's consuming that content  the person who's reading that particular information could choose any engine  and they could read it in their own mother tongue  in their native language. I mean  this is an incredibly attractive idea  especially for India. We have so many different languages. There's a song about India  and there's a description of the country as  it says  That means  ever smiling speaker of beautiful languages.  Language is beautiful. I think it's the most beautiful of human creations. I think it's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented. It entertains  it educates  it enlightens  but what I like the most about language is that it empowers. I want to leave you with this. This is a photograph of my collaborators  my earliest collaborators when I started working on language and autism and various other things. The girl's name is Pavna  and that's her mother  Kalpana. And Pavna's an entrepreneur  but her story is much more remarkable than mine  because Pavna is about   . She has quadriplegic cerebral palsy  so ever since she was born  she could neither move nor talk. And everything that she's accomplished so far  finishing school  going to college  starting a company  collaborating with me to develop Avaz  all of these things she's done with nothing more than moving her eyes. Daniel Webster said this  He said   If all of my possessions were taken from me with one exception  I would choose to keep the power of communication  for with it  I would regain all the rest.  And that's why  of all of these incredible  applications of FreeSpeech  the one that's closest to my heart still remains the ability for this to empower children with disabilities to be able to communicate  the power of communication  to get back all the rest. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  So my moment of truth did not come all at once. In       I had the chance to be considered for promotion from my job as director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department. This was my moment to lean in  to push myself forward for what are really only a handful of the very top foreign policy jobs  and I had just finished a big     month project for Secretary Clinton  successfully  and I knew I could handle a bigger job. The woman I thought I was would have said yes. But I had been commuting for two years between Washington and Princeton  New Jersey  where my husband and my two teenage sons lived  and it was not going well. I tried on the idea of eking out another two years in Washington  or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them to join me. But deep down  I knew that the right decision was to go home  even if I didn't fully recognize the woman who was making that choice. That was a decision based on love and responsibility. I couldn't keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being able to be there for him when and if he needed me. But the real change came more gradually. Over the next year  while my family was righting itself  I started to realize that even if I could go back into government  I didn't want to. I didn't want to miss the last five years that my sons were at home. I finally allowed myself to accept what was really most important to me  not what I was conditioned to want or maybe what I conditioned myself to want  and that decision led to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that I grew up with and have always championed. I am still completely committed to the cause of male female equality  but let's think about what that equality really means  and how best to achieve it. I always accepted the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society are men at the top of their careers  so that the measure of male female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions  prime ministers  presidents  CEOs  directors  managers  Nobel laureates  leaders. I still think we should do everything we possibly can to achieve that goal. But that's only half of real equality  and I now think we're never going to get there unless we recognize the other half. I suggest that real equality  full equality  does not just mean valuing women on male terms. It means creating a much wider range of equally respected choices for women and for men. And to get there  we have to change our workplaces  our policies and our culture. In the workplace  real equality means valuing family just as much as work  and understanding that the two reinforce each other. As a leader and as a manager  I have always acted on the mantra  if family comes first  work does not come second    life comes together. If you work for me  and you have a family issue  I expect you to attend to it  and I am confident  and my confidence has always been borne out  that the work will get done  and done better. Workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused  more efficient  more results focused. And breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts. Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents. He's much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office. And caregiving itself develops patience    a lot of patience    and empathy  creativity  resilience  adaptability. Those are all attributes that are ever more important in a high speed  horizontal  networked global economy. The best companies actually know this. The companies that win awards for workplace flexibility in the United States include some of our most successful corporations  and a      national study on the changing workforce showed that employees in flexible and effective workplaces are more engaged with their work  they're more satisfied and more loyal  they have lower levels of stress and higher levels of mental health. And a      study of employers showed that deep  flexible practices actually lowered operating costs and increased adaptability in a global service economy. So you may think that the privileging of work over family is only an American problem. Sadly  though  the obsession with work is no longer a uniquely American disease. Twenty years ago  when my family first started going to Italy  we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta. Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day. It's actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family lunch. Now  when we go  fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta  reflecting the advance of global corporations and    hour competition. So making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative. In policy terms  real equality means recognizing that the work that women have traditionally done is just as important as the work that men have traditionally done  no matter who does it. Think about it  Breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival. At least if we get beyond a barter economy  somebody has to earn an income and someone else has to convert that income to care and sustenance for loved ones. Now most of you  when you hear me talk about breadwinning and caregiving  instinctively translate those categories into men's work and women's work. And we don't typically challenge why men's work is advantaged. But consider a same sex couple like my friends Sarah and Emily. They're psychiatrists. They got married five years ago  and now they have two year old twins. They love being mothers  but they also love their work  and they're really good at what they do. So how are they going to divide up breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities  Should one of them stop working or reduce hours to be home  Or should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules  And what criteria should they use to make that decision  Is it who makes the most money or who is most committed to her career  Or who has the most flexible boss  The same sex perspective helps us see that juggling work and family are not women's problems  they're family problems. And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones  because they have a choice about how much they want to work. Millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn the income they need  and many of those workers are scrambling. They're patching together care arrangements that are inadequate and often actually unsafe. If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal  then why shouldn't a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care as the foundation of a healthy society as it invests in physical infrastructure as the backbone of a successful economy  The governments that get it    no surprises here    the governments that get it  Norway  Sweden  Denmark  the Netherlands  provide universal child care  support for caregivers at home  school and early childhood education  protections for pregnant women  and care for the elderly and the disabled. Those governments invest in that infrastructure the same way they invest in roads and bridges and tunnels and trains. Those societies also show you that breadwinning and caregiving reinforce each other. They routinely rank among the top    countries of the most globally competitive economies  but at the same time  they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index. In fact  they rank higher than other governments  like my own  the U.S.  or Switzerland  that have higher average levels of income but lower rankings on work life balance. So changing our workplaces and building infrastructures of care would make a big difference  but we're not going to get equally valued choices unless we change our culture  and the kind of cultural change required means re socializing men. Increasingly in developed countries  women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only in the home  but men are actually still where they always were. Men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners  that to derive their self worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder. The feminist revolution still has a long way to go. It's certainly not complete. But    years after  The Feminine Mystique  was published  many women actually have more choices than men do. We can decide to be a breadwinner  a caregiver  or any combination of the two. When a man  on the other hand  decides to be a caregiver  he puts his manhood on the line. His friends may praise his decision  but underneath  they're scratching their heads. Isn't the measure of a man his willingness to compete with other men for power and prestige  And as many women hold that view as men do. We know that lots of women still judge the attractiveness of a man based in large part on how successful he is in his career. A woman can drop out of the work force and still be an attractive partner. For a man  that's a risky proposition. So as parents and partners  we should be socializing our sons and our husbands to be whatever they want to be  either caregivers or breadwinners. We should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys. I can almost hear lots of you thinking   No way.  But in fact  the change is  actually already happening. At least in the United States  lots of men take pride in cooking  and frankly obsess over stoves. They are in the birthing rooms. They take paternity leave when they can. They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can  and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework. Indeed  there are male college students now who are starting to say   I want to be a stay at home dad.  That was completely unthinkable    or even    years ago. And in Norway  where men have an automatic three month's paternity leave  but they lose it if they decide not to take it  a high government official told me that companies are starting to look at prospective male employees and raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact take their leave when they had kids. That means that it's starting to seem like a character defect not to want to be a fully engaged father. So I was raised to believe that championing women's rights meant doing everything we could to get women to the top. And I still hope that I live long enough to see men and women equally represented at all levels of the work force. But I've come to believe that we have to value family every bit as much as we value work  and that we should entertain the idea that doing right by those we love will make all of us better at everything we do. Thirty years ago  Carol Gilligan  a wonderful psychologist  studied adolescent girls and identified an ethic of care  an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice. It turns out that  you don't care  is just as much a part of who we are as  that's not fair.  Bill Gates agrees. He argues that the two great forces of human nature are self interest and caring for others. Let's bring them both together. Let's make the feminist revolution a humanist revolution. As whole human beings  we will be better caregivers and breadwinners. You may think that can't happen  but I grew up in a society where my mother put out small vases of cigarettes for dinner parties  where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms  and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual. Today  not so much. The revolution for human equality can happen. It is happening. It will happen. How far and how fast is up to us. Thank you. Let me start by asking you a question  just with a show of hands  Who has an iPhone  Who has an Android phone  Who has a Blackberry  Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry  And let me guess  how many of you  when you arrived here  like me  went and bought a pay as you go SIM card  Yeah  I'll bet you didn't even know you're using African technology. Pay as you go was a technology  or an idea  pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom a good    years ago  and now  like franchising  pay as you go is one of the most dominant forces of economic activity in the world. So I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa  which I think is the purest form  innovation out of necessity. But first  I'm going to ask you some other questions. You don't have to put your hands up. These are rhetorical. Why did Nikola Tesla have to invent the alternating current that powers the lights in this building or the city that we're in  Why did Henry Ford have to invent the production line to produce these Fords that came in anything as long as they were black  And why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos  Blank stares. That is what a dolos looks like  and in the background  you can see Robben Island. This is a small dolos  and Eric Merrifield is the most famous inventor you've never heard of. In       a storm ripped up the harbor in a small South African town called East London  and while he was watching his kids playing with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse  he had the idea for this. It's a bit like a huge jumping jack  and they have used this in every harbor in the world as a breakwater. The global shipping economy would not be possible without African technology like this. So whenever you talk about Africa  you have to put up this picture of the world from space  and people go   Look  it's the Dark Continent.  Actually  it isn't. What it is is a map of innovation. And it's really easy to see where innovation's going on. All the places with lots of electricity  it isn't. And the reason it isn't is because everybody's watching television or playing Angry Birds. So where it's happening is in Africa. Now  this is real innovation  not the way people have expropriated the word to talk about launching new products. This is real innovation  and I define it as problem solving. People are solving real problems in Africa. Why  Because we have to. Because we have real problems. And when we solve real problems for people  we solve them for the rest of the world at the same time. So in California  everybody's really excited about a little square of plastic that you plug into a phone and you can swipe your credit card  and people say   We've liberated the credit card from the point of sale terminal.  Fantastic. Why do you even need a credit card  In Africa  we've been doing that for years  and we've been doing it on phones like this. This is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela  about an hour south of Nairobi  and the thing that's so remarkable about the payment system that's been pioneered in Africa called M Pesa is that it works on phones like this. It works on every single phone possible  because it uses SMS. You can pay bills with it   you can buy your groceries  you can pay your kids' school fees  and I'm told you can even bribe customs officials. Something like    million dollars a day is transacted through M Pesa. Forty percent of Kenya's GDP moves through M Pesa using phones like this. And you think this is just a feature phone. Actually it's the smartphone of Africa. It's also a radio  and it's also a torch  and more than anything else  it has really superb battery life. Why  Because that's what we need. We have really severe energy problems in Africa. By the way  you can update Facebook and send Gmail from a phone like this. So we have found a way to use the available technology to send money via M Pesa  which is a bit like a check system for the mobile age. I come from Johannesburg  which is a mining town. It's built on gold. This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier. And the difference today is that  the gold of today is mobile. If you think about the railroad system in North America and how that worked  first came the infrastructure  then came the industry around it  the brothels    it's a bit like the Internet today  right    and everything else that worked with it  bars  saloons  etc. The gold of today is mobile  and mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible. So what are some of the things that you can do with it  Well  this is by a guy called Bright Simons from Ghana  and what you do is you take medication  something that some people might spend their entire month's salary on  and you scratch off the code  and you send that to an SMS number  and it tells you if that is legitimate or if it's expired. Really simple  really effective  really life saving. In Kenya  there's a service called iCow  which just sends you really important information about how to look after your dairy. The dairy business in Kenya is a      million business  and the difference between a subsistence farmer and an abundance farmer is only a couple of liters of milk a day. And if you can do that  you can rise out of poverty. Really simple  using a basic phone. If you don't have electricity  no problem  We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts using a windmill  as William Kamkwamba did. There's another great African that you've heard that's busy disrupting the automobile industry in the world. He's also finding a way to reinvent solar power and the electricity industry in North America  and if he's lucky  he'll get us to Mars  hopefully in my lifetime. He comes from Pretoria  the capital of  South Africa   about    kilometers from where I live. So back to Joburg  which is sometimes called Egoli  which means City of Gold. And not only is mobile the gold of today  I don't believe that the gold is under the ground. I believe we are the gold. Like you've heard the other economists say  we are at the point where China was when its boom years began  and that's where we're going. So  you hear the West talk about innovation at the edge. Well  of course it's happening at the edge  because in the middle  everybody's updating Facebook  or worse still  they're trying to understand Facebook's privacy settings. This is not that catchy catchphrase. This is innovation over the edge. So  people like to call Africa a mobile first continent  but actually it's mobile only  so while everybody else is doing all of those things  we're solving the world's problems. So there's only one thing left to say.   You're welcome    Laughter  Anyone in the room thought about sex today  Yeah  you did. Thank you for putting your hand up over there. Well  I'm here to provide you with some biological validation for your sordid daydreams. I'm here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex. Now  when humans think about sex  male and female forms are generally what come to mind  but for many millions of years  such specific categories didn't even exist. Sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of DNA shared between two or more beings. It wasn't until about     million years ago that we start to see structures akin to a penis or a thing that gives DNA out  and a vagina  something that receives it. Now invariably  you're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species  these very familiar structures  but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind blowing. Penile diversity is especially profuse. So this is a paper nautilus. It's a close relative of squid and octopus  and males have a hectocotylus. Just what is a hectocotylus  A detachable  swimming penis. It leaves the  body of the male   finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water  attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm. For many decades  biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether. Now  the tapir is a mammal from South America. And the tapir has a prehensile penis. It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands. And it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus  not to mention it's a pretty good size. The biggest penis in the animal kingdom  however  is not that of the tapir. The biggest penis to body size ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle  and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that of a barnacle. Mm hm.  Laughter  So with all of this diversity in structure  one might think  then  that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction. Simply insert part A into slot B  and we should all be good to go. But of course  that doesn't exactly happen  and that's because we can't just take form into account. We have to think about function as well  and when it comes to sex  function relates to the contributions made by the gametes  or the sperm and the eggs. And these contributions are far from equal. Eggs are very expensive to make  so it makes sense for females to be very choosy about who she shares them with. Sperm  on the other hand  is abundant and cheap  so it makes more sense for males to have a more sex is better strategy when it comes to siring members of future generations. So how do animals cope with these very incongruent needs between the sexes  I mean  if a female doesn't choose a particular male  or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough  then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things  avoiding predators  taking care of offspring  gathering and ingesting food. This is  of course  bad news for any male who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank  and this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies for successful fertilization. This is bedbug sex  and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination. Males have a spiked  barbed penis that they literally stab into the female  and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina. They stab it anywhere in her body  and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries. If a female gets too many stab wounds  or if a stab wound happens to become infected  she can actually die from it. Now if you've ever been out for a nice  peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex  you've undoubtedly been alarmed  because it looks like gang rape. And quite frankly  that's exactly what it is. A group of males will grab a female  hold her down  and ballistically ejaculate their spiral shaped penis into her corkscrew shaped vagina over and over and over again. From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second. Now the female actually gets the last laugh  though  because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries. Now  I like to share stories like this with my audiences because  yeah  we humans  we tend to think sex  sex is fun  sex is good  there's romance  and there's orgasm. But orgasm didn't actually evolve until about    million years ago with the advent of mammals. But some animals had it going on quite a bit before that. There are some more primitive ways of pleasing one's partner. Earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones. It's a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different. Those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all. So going back to our biological minds  then  we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages  because she can use her time for other things  avoiding predators  taking care of young  finding and ingesting food. But biologists have repeatedly observed that females choose to have sex with the males that have the long appendages. Why do they do this  Well  according to the biological literature   During copulation  the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract.  Mm hm. These are Mexican guppies  and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments  and these filaments basically form a fish mustache  if you will. Now males have been observed to prod the female's genital opening prior to copulating with her  and in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum  P.I. hypothesis  females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches. A little guppy porn for you right there. So we've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner. We've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex. We've also seen a titillation strategy where males are actually pleasing their female partners into choosing them as a sex partner. Now unfortunately  in the animal kingdom  it's the coercion strategy that we see time and time again. It's very common in many phyla  from invertebrates to avian species  mammals  and  of course  even in primates. Now interestingly  there  are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place. Female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris  or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally  much like a penis  and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology. So before a male can insert his penis into a female's vagina  she has to take this penile clitoris and basically inside out it in her own body. I mean  imagine putting a penis into another penis. It's simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action. Now  even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal  they're run by females  groups of females  sisters  aunts and offspring  and when young males attain sexual maturity  they're turfed out of the group. In hyena societies  adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale. They can take part in a kill only after everybody else  including the offspring. So it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male  you take away all the social power he has. So what are my take home messages from my talk today  Well  sex is just so much more than insert part A into slot B and hope that the offspring run around everywhere. The sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically dictate how males and females will react to each other  which then dictates how populations and societies form and evolve. So it may not be surprising to any of you that animals  including ourselves  spend a good amount of time thinking about sex  but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it. So thank you  and happy daydreaming.   Rebecca Newberger Goldstein     Steven Pinker     The Long Reach of Reason   Cabbie  Twenty two dollars. Steven Pinker  Okay. Rebecca Newberger Goldstein  Reason  appears to have fallen on hard times  Popular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth and political discourse has become a race to the bottom. We're living in an era of scientific creationism       conspiracy theories  psychic hotlines  and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism. People who think too well are often accused of elitism  and even in the academy  there are attacks on logocentrism  the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking. SP  But is this necessarily a bad thing  Perhaps reason is overrated. Many pundits have argued that a good heart and steadfast moral clarity are superior to triangulations of overeducated policy wonks  like the best and brightest and that dragged us into the quagmire of Vietnam. And wasn't it reason that gave us the means to despoil the planet and threaten our species with weapons of mass destruction  In this way of thinking   it's character and conscience  not cold hearted calculation  that will save us. Besides  a human being is not a brain on a stick. My fellow psychologists have shown that we're led by our bodies and our emotions and use our puny powers of reason merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact. RNG  How could a reasoned argument logically entail the ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments  Look  you're trying to persuade us of reason's impotence. You're not threatening us or bribing us  suggesting that we resolve the issue with a show of hands or a beauty contest. By the very act of trying to reason us into your position  you're conceding reason's potency. Reason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be. You show up for that debate and you've already lost it. SP  But can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral  After all  you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end  and the end depends on the reasoner's passions. Reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reasoner wants peace and harmony  but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife. Can reason force the reasoner to want less cruelty and waste  RNG  All on its own  the answer is no  but it doesn't take much to switch it to yes. You need two conditions  The first is that reasoners all care about their own well being. That's one of the passions that has to be present in order for reason to go to work  and it's obviously present in all of us. We all care passionately about our own well being. The second condition is that reasoners are members of a community of reasoners who can affect one another's well being  can exchange messages  and comprehend each other's reasoning. And that's certainly true of our gregarious and loquatious species  well endowed with the instinct for language. SP  Well  that sounds good in theory  but has it worked that way in practice  In particular  can it explain a momentous historical development that I spoke about five years ago here at TED  Namely  we seem to be getting more humane. Centuries ago  our ancestors would burn cats alive as a form of popular entertainment. Knights waged constant war on each other by trying to kill as many of each other's peasants as possible. Governments executed people for frivolous reasons  like stealing a cabbage or criticizing the royal garden. The executions were designed to be as prolonged and as painful as possible  like crucifixion  disembowelment  breaking on the wheel. Respectable people kept slaves. For all our flaws  we have abandoned these barbaric practices. RNG  So  do you think it's human nature that's changed  SP  Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts that can erupt in violence  like greed  tribalism  revenge  dominance  sadism. But we also have instincts that can steer us away  like self control  empathy  a sense of fairness  what Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. RNG  So if human nature didn't change  what invigorated those better angels  SP  Well  among other things  our circle of empathy expanded. Years ago  our ancestors would feel the pain only of their family and people in their village. But with the expansion of literacy and travel  people started to sympathize with wider and wider circles  the clan  the tribe  the nation  the race  and perhaps eventually  all of humanity. RNG  Can hard headed scientists really give so much credit to soft hearted empathy  SP  They can and do. Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain that respond to other people's actions the same way they respond to our own. Empathy emerges early in life  perhaps before the age of one. Books on empathy have become bestsellers  like  The Empathic Civilization  and  The Age of Empathy.  RNG  I'm all for empathy. I mean  who isn't  But all on its own  it's a feeble instrument for making moral progress. For one thing  it's innately biased toward blood relations  babies and warm  fuzzy animals. As far as empathy is concerned  ugly outsiders can go to hell. And even our best attempts to work up sympathy for those who are unconnected with us fall miserably short  a sad truth about human nature that was pointed out by Adam Smith. Adam Smith  Let us suppose that the great empire of China was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake  and let us consider how a  man of humanity in Europe would react on receiving intelligence of this dreadful calamity. He would  I imagine  first of all express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people. He would make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life  and when all these humane sentiments had been once fairly expressed  he would pursue his business or his pleasure with the same ease and tranquility as if no such accident had happened. If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow  he would not sleep tonight  but provided he never saw them  he would snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren. SP  But if empathy wasn't enough to make us more humane  what else was there  RNG  Well  you didn't mention what might be one of our most effective better angels  reason. Reason has muscle. It's reason that provides the push to widen that circle of empathy. Every one of the humanitarian developments that you mentioned originated with thinkers who gave reasons for why some practice was indefensible. They demonstrated that the way people treated some particular group of others was logically inconsistent with the way they insisted on being treated themselves. SP  Are you saying that reason can actually change people's minds  Don't people just stick with whatever conviction serves their interests or conforms to the culture that they grew up in  RNG  Here's a fascinating fact about us  Contradictions bother us  at least when we're forced to confront them  which is just another way of saying that we are susceptible to reason. And if you look at the history of moral progress  you can trace a direct pathway from reasoned arguments to changes in the way that we actually feel. Time and again  a thinker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was indefensible  irrational  inconsistent with values already held. Their essay would go viral  get translated into many languages  get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons  and at dinner parties  and influence leaders  legislators  popular opinion. Eventually their conclusions get absorbed into the common sense of decency  erasing the tracks of the original argument that had gotten us there. Few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hangings or beating children. By now  these things just feel wrong. But just those arguments had to be made  and they were  in centuries past. SP  Are you saying that people needed a step by step argument to grasp why something might be a wee bit wrong with burning heretics at the stake  RNG  Oh  they did. Here's the French theologian Sebastian Castellio making the case. Sebastian Castellio  Calvin says that he's certain  and other sects say that they are. Who shall be judge  If the matter is certain  to whom is it so  To Calvin  But then  why does he write so many books about manifest truth  In view of the uncertainty  we must define heretics simply as one with whom we disagree. And if then we are going to kill heretics  the logical outcome will be a war of extermination  since each is sure of himself. SP  Or with hideous punishments like breaking on the wheel  RNG  The prohibition in our constitution of cruel and unusual punishments was a response to a pamphlet circulated in      by the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria. Cesare Beccaria  As punishments become more cruel  the minds of men  which like fluids always adjust to the level of the objects that surround them  become hardened  and after a hundred years of cruel punishments  breaking on the wheel causes no more fear than imprisonment previously did. For a punishment to achieve its objective  it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime  and into this calculation ought to be factored the certainty of punishment and the loss of the good that the commission of the crime will produce. Everything beyond this is superfluous  and therefore tyrannical. SP  But surely antiwar movements depended on mass demonstrations and catchy tunes by folk singers and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war. RNG  No doubt  but modern anti war movements reach back to a long chain of thinkers who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize our emotions against war  such as the father of modernity  Erasmus. Erasmus  The advantages derived from peace diffuse themselves far and wide  and reach great numbers  while in war  if anything turns out happily  the advantage redounds only to a few  and those unworthy of reaping it. One man's safety is owing to the destruction of another. One man's prize is derived from the plunder of another. The cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning. Whatever is unfortunate in war  is severely so indeed  and whatever  on the contrary  is called good fortune  is a savage and a cruel good fortune  an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another's woe. SP  But everyone knows that the movement to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion. It was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers  and it only became popular when Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel  Uncle Tom's Cabin  became a bestseller. RNG  But the ball got rolling a century before. John Locke bucked the tide of millennia that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural. He argued that it was inconsistent with the principles of rational government. John Locke  Freedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by common to everyone of that society and made by the legislative power erected in it  a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule prescribes not  not to be subject to the inconstant  uncertain  unknown  arbitrary will of another man  as freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature. SP  Those words sound familiar. Where have I read them before  Ah  yes. Mary Astell  If absolute sovereignty  be not necessary in a state  how comes it to be so in a family  Or if in a family  why not in a state  Since no reason can be alleged for the one that will not hold more strongly for the other  if all men are born free  how is it that all women are born slaves  as they must be if being subjected to the inconstant  uncertain  unknown  arbitrary will of men be the perfect condition of slavery  RNG  That sort of co option is all in the job description of reason. One movement for the expansion of rights inspires another because the logic is the same  and once that's hammered home  it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to ignore the inconsistency. In the     s  the Civil Rights Movement inspired the movements for women's rights  children's rights  gay rights and even animal rights. But fully two centuries before  the Enlightenment thinker Jeremy Bentham had exposed the indefensibility of customary practices such as the cruelty to animals. Jeremy Bentham  The question is not  can they reason  nor can they talk  but can they suffer  RNG  And the persecution of homosexuals. JB  As to any primary mischief  it's evident that it produces no pain in anyone. On the contrary  it produces pleasure. The partners are both willing. If either of them be unwilling  the act is an offense  totally different in its nature of effects. It's a personal injury. It's a kind of rape. As to the any danger exclusive of pain  the danger  if any  much consist in the tendency of the example. But what is the tendency of this example  To dispose others to engage in the same practices. But this practice produces not pain of any kind to anyone. SP  Still  in every case  it took at least a century for the arguments of these great thinkers to trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole. It kind of makes you wonder about our own time. Are there practices that we engage in where the arguments against them are there for all to see but nonetheless we persist in them  RNG  When our great grandchildren look back at us  will they be as appalled by some of our practices as we are by our slave owning  heretic burning  wife beating  gay bashing ancestors  SP  I'm sure everyone here could think of an example. RNG  I opt for the mistreatment of animals in factory farms. SP  The imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders and the toleration of rape in our nation's prisons. RNG  Scrimping on donations to life saving charities in the developing world. SP  The possession of nuclear weapons. RNG  The appeal to religion to justify the otherwise unjustifiable  such as the ban on contraception. SP  What about religious faith in general  RNG  Eh  I'm not holding my breath. SP  Still  I have become convinced that reason is a better angel that deserves the greatest credit for the moral progress our species has enjoyed and that holds out the greatest hope for continuing moral progress in the future. RNG  And if  our friends  you detect a flaw in this argument  just remember you'll be depending on reason to point it out. Thank you. SP  Thank you. I'd like to talk today about how we can change our brains and our society. Meet Joe. Joe's    years old and a murderer. I met Joe    years ago on the lifer wing at Wormwood Scrubs high security prison in London. I'd like you to imagine this place. It looks and feels like it sounds  Wormwood Scrubs. Built at the end of the Victorian Era by the inmates themselves  it is where England's most dangerous prisoners are kept. These individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil. And I was there to study their brains. I was part of a team of researchers from University College London  on a grant from the U.K. department of health. My task was to study a group of inmates who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths. That meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population. What lay at the root of their behavior  Was there a neurological cause for their condition  And if there was a neurological cause  could we find a cure  So I'd like to speak about change  and  especially about emotional change. Growing up  I was always intrigued by how people change. My mother  a clinical psychotherapist  would occasionally see patients at home in the evening. She would shut the door to the living room  and I imagined magical things happened in that room. At the age of five or six I would creep up in my pajamas and sit outside with my ear glued to the door. On more than one occasion  I fell asleep and they had to push me out of the way at the end of the session. And I suppose that's how I found myself walking into the secure interview room on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs. Joe sat across a steel table and greeted me with this blank expression. The prison warden  looking equally indifferent  said   Any trouble  just press the red buzzer  and we'll be around as soon as we can.  I sat down. The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me. I looked up at the red buzzer far behind Joe on the opposite wall. I looked at Joe. Perhaps detecting my concern  he leaned forward  and said  as reassuringly as he could   Ah  don't worry about the buzzer  it doesn't work anyway.  Over the subsequent months  we tested Joe and his fellow inmates  looking specifically at their ability to categorize different images of emotion. And we looked at their physical response to those emotions. So  for example  when most of us look at a picture like this of somebody looking sad  we instantly have a slight  measurable physical response  increased heart rate  sweating of the skin. Whilst the psychopaths in our study were able to describe the pictures accurately  they failed to show the emotions required. They failed to show a physical response. It was as though they knew the words but not the music of empathy. So we wanted to look closer at this to use MRI to image their brains. That turned out to be not such an easy task. Imagine transporting a collection of clinical psychopaths across central London in shackles and handcuffs in rush hour  and in order to place each of them in an MRI scanner  you have to remove all metal objects  including shackles and handcuffs  and  as I learned  all body piercings. After some time  however  we had a tentative answer. These individuals were not just the victims of a troubled childhood. There was something else. People like Joe have a deficit in a brain area called the amygdala. The amygdala is an almond shaped organ deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain. It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy. Normally  the more empathic a person is  the larger and more active their amygdala is. Our population of inmates had a deficient amygdala  which likely led to their lack of empathy and to their immoral behavior. So let's take a step back. Normally  acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up  like learning to speak. At the age of six months  virtually every one of us is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects. At the age of    months  most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others. So for example  your mother raises her hands to stretch  and you imitate her behavior. At first  this isn't perfect. I remember my cousin Sasha  two years old at the time  looking through a picture book and licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand  licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand. Bit by bit  we build the foundations  of the social brain so that by the time we're three  four years old  most children  not all  have acquired the ability to understand the intentions of others  another prerequisite for empathy. The fact that this developmental progression is universal  irrespective of where you live in the world or which culture you inhabit  strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are inborn. If you doubt this  try  as I've done  to renege on a promise you've made to a four year old. You will find that the mind of a four year old is not na ve in the slightest. It is more akin to a Swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development and a sharp sense of fairness. The early years are crucial. There seems to be a window of opportunity  after which mastering moral questions becomes more difficult  like adults learning a foreign language. That's not to say it's impossible. A recent  wonderful study from Stanford University showed that people who have played a virtual reality game in which they took on the role of a good and helpful superhero actually became more caring and helpful towards others afterwards. Now I'm not suggesting we endow criminals with superpowers  but I am suggesting that we need to find ways to get Joe and people like him to change their brains and their behavior  for their benefit and for the benefit of the rest of us. So can brains change  For over     years  neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood  no new brain cells could grow in the adult human brain. The brain could only change within certain set limits. That was the dogma. But then  in the     s  studies starting showing  following the lead of Elizabeth Gould at Princeton and others  studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis  the birth of new brain cells in the adult mammalian brain  first in the olfactory bulb  which is responsible for our sense of smell  then in the hippocampus involving short term memory  and finally in the amygdala itself. In order to understand how this process works  I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford specializing in learning and development. Instead of psychopaths  I studied mice  because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals. So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage  a shoebox  essentially  with cotton wool  alone and without much stimulation  not only does it not thrive  but it will often develop strange  repetitive behaviors. This naturally sociable animal will lose its ability to bond with other mice  even becoming aggressive when introduced to them. However  mice reared in what we called an enriched environment  a large habitation with other mice with wheels and ladders and areas to explore  demonstrate neurogenesis  the birth of new brain cells  and as we showed  they also perform better on a range of learning and memory tasks. Now  they don't develop morality to the point of carrying the shopping bags of little old mice across the street  but their improved environment results in healthy  sociable behavior. Mice reared in a standard cage  by contrast  not dissimilar  you might say  from a prison cell  have dramatically lower levels of new neurons in the brain. It is now clear that the amygdala of mammals  including primates like us  can show neurogenesis. In some areas of the brain  more than    percent of cells are newly formed. We're just beginning to understand what exact function these cells have  but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change way into adulthood. However  our brains are also exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment. Stress hormones  glucocorticoids  released by the brain  suppress the growth of these new cells. The more stress  the less brain development  which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels. This is the interplay between nature and nurture in real time in front of our eyes. When you think about it  it is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth. Of course  imprisonment is a necessary part of the criminal justice system and of protecting society. Our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their MRI scans as evidence in court and get off the hook because they've got a faulty amygdala. The evidence is actually the other way. Because our brains are capable of change  we need to take responsibility for our actions  and they need to take responsibility for their rehabilitation. One way such rehabilitation might work is through restorative justice programs. Here victims  if they choose to participate  and perpetrators meet face to face in safe  structured encounters  and the perpetrator is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions  and the victim plays an active role in the process. In such a setting  the perpetrator can see  perhaps for the first time  the victim as a real person with thoughts and feelings and a genuine emotional response. This stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration. Such programs won't work for everyone  but for many  it could be a way to break the frozen sea within. So what can we do now  How can we apply this knowledge  I'd like to leave you with three lessons that I learned. The first thing that I learned was that we need to change our mindset. Since Wormwood Scrubs was built     years ago  society has advanced in virtually every aspect  in the way we run our schools  our hospitals. Yet the moment we speak about prisons  it's as though we're back in Dickensian times  if not medieval times. For too long  I believe  we've allowed ourselves to be persuaded of the false notion that human  nature cannot change  and as a society  it's costing us dearly. We know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change  and the best way to achieve that  even in adults  is to change and modulate our environment. The second thing I have learned is that we need to create an alliance of people who believe that science is integral to bringing about social change. It's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place a high security inmate in an MRI scanner. Well actually  that turns out not to be so easy  but ultimately what we want to show is whether we're able to reduce the reoffending rates. In order to answer complex questions like that  we need people of different backgrounds    lab based scientists and clinicians  social workers and policy makers  philanthropists and human rights activists   to work together. Finally  I believe we need to change our own amygdalae  because this issue goes to the heart not just of who Joe is  but who we are. We need to change our view of Joe as someone wholly irredeemable  because if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable  how is he going to see himself as any different  In another decade  Joe will be released from Wormwood Scrubs. Will he be among the    percent of inmates who end up reoffending and returning to the prison system  Wouldn't it be better if  while serving his sentence  Joe was able to train his amygdala  which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections  so that he will be able to face the world once he gets released  Surely  that would be in the interest of all of us. Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  The rights of citizens  the future of the Internet. So I would like to welcome to the TED stage the man behind those revelations  Ed Snowden. Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia controlling this bot from his laptop  so he can see what the bot can see. Ed  welcome to the TED stage. What can you see  as a matter of fact  Edward Snowden  Ha  I can see everyone. This is amazing. CA  Ed  some questions for you. You've been called many things in the last few months. You've been called a whistleblower  a traitor  a hero. What words would you describe yourself with  ES  You know  everybody who is involved with this debate has been struggling over me and my personality and how to describe me. But when I think about it  this isn't the question that we should be struggling with. Who I am really doesn't matter at all. If I'm the worst person in the world  you can hate me and move on. What really matters here are the issues. What really matters here is the kind of government we want  the kind of Internet we want  the kind of relationship between people and societies. And that's what I'm hoping the debate will move towards  and we've seen that increasing over time. If I had to describe myself  I wouldn't use words like  hero.  I wouldn't use  patriot   and I wouldn't use  traitor.  I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen  just like everyone else. CA  So just to give some context for those who don't know the whole story    this time a year ago  you were stationed in Hawaii working as a consultant to the NSA. As a sysadmin  you had access to their systems  and you began revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists leading the way to June's revelations. Now  what propelled you to do this  ES  You know  when I was sitting in Hawaii  and the years before  when I was working in the intelligence community  I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me. We do a lot of good things in the intelligence community  things that need to be done  and things that help everyone. But there are also things that go too far. There are things that shouldn't be done  and decisions that were being made in secret without the public's awareness  without the public's consent  and without even our representatives in government having knowledge of these programs. When I really came to struggle with these issues  I thought to myself  how can I do this in the most responsible way  that maximizes the public benefit while minimizing the risks  And out of all the solutions that I could come up with  out of going to Congress  when there were no laws  there were no legal protections for a private employee  a contractor in intelligence like myself  there was a risk that I would be buried along with the information and the public would never find out. But the First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees us a free press for a reason  and that's to enable an adversarial press  to challenge the government  but also to work together with the government  to have a dialogue and debate about how we can inform the public about matters of vital importance without putting our national security at risk. And by working with journalists  by giving all of my information back to the American people  rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication  we've had a robust debate with a deep investment by the government that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone. And the risks that have been threatened  the risks that have been played up by the government have never materialized. We've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm  and because of that  I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made. CA  So let me show the audience a couple of examples of what you revealed. If we could have a slide up  and Ed  I don't know whether you can see  the slides are here. This is a slide of the PRISM program  and maybe you could tell the audience what that was that was revealed. ES  The best way to understand PRISM  because there's been a little bit of controversy  is to first talk about what PRISM isn't. Much of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata. They've said it's just metadata  it's just metadata  and they're talking about a specific legal authority called Section     of the Patriot Act. That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping  mass surveillance of the entire country's phone records  things like that    who you're talking to  when you're talking to them  where you traveled. These are all metadata events. PRISM is about content. It's a program through which the government could compel corporate America  it could deputize corporate America to do its dirty work for the NSA. And even though some of these companies did resist  even though some of them    I believe Yahoo was one of them   challenged them in court  they all lost  because it was never tried by an open court. They were only tried by a secret court. And something that we've seen  something about the PRISM program that's very concerning to me is  there's been a talking point in the U.S. government where they've said    federal judges have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful  but what they don't tell you is those are secret judges in a secret court based on secret interpretations of law that's considered        warrant requests over    years  and in    years only rejected    government requests. These aren't the people that we want deciding what the role of corporate America in a free and open Internet should be. CA  Now  this slide that we're showing here shows the dates in which different technology companies  Internet companies  are alleged to have joined the program  and where data collection began from them. Now  they have denied collaborating with the NSA. How was that data collected by the NSA  ES  Right. So the NSA's own slides refer to it as direct access. What that means to an actual NSA analyst  someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst targeting  Chinese cyber hackers  things like that  in Hawaii  is the provenance of that data is directly from their servers. It doesn't mean that there's a group of company representatives sitting in a smoky room with the NSA palling around and making back room deals about how they're going to give this stuff away. Now each company handles it different ways. Some are responsible. Some are somewhat less responsible. But the bottom line is  when we talk about how this information is given  it's coming from the companies themselves. It's not stolen from the lines. But there's an important thing to remember here  even though companies pushed back  even though companies demanded  hey  let's do this through a warrant process  let's do this where we actually have some sort of legal review  some sort of basis for handing over these users' data  we saw stories in the Washington Post last year that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story that said the NSA broke in to the data center communications between Google to itself and Yahoo to itself. So even these companies that are cooperating in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner with the NSA  the NSA isn't satisfied with that  and because of that  we need our companies to work very hard to guarantee that they're going to represent the interests of the user  and also advocate for the rights of the users. And I think over the last year  we've seen the companies that are named on the PRISM slides take great strides to do that  and I encourage them to continue. CA  What more should they do  ES  The biggest thing that an Internet company in America can do today  right now  without consulting with lawyers  to protect the rights of users worldwide  is to enable SSL web encryption on every page you visit. The reason this matters is today  if you go to look at a copy of        on Amazon.com  the NSA can see a record of that  the Russian intelligence service can see a record of that  the Chinese service can see a record of that  the French service  the German service  the services of Andorra. They can all see it because it's unencrypted. The world's library is Amazon.com  but not only do they not support encryption by default  you cannot choose to use encryption when browsing through books. This is something that we need to change  not just for Amazon  I don't mean to single them out  but they're a great example. All companies need to move to an encrypted browsing habit by default for all users who haven't taken any action or picked any special methods on their own. That'll increase the privacy and the rights that people enjoy worldwide. CA  Ed  come with me to this part of the stage. I want to show you the next slide here.  Applause  This is a program called Boundless Informant. What is that  ES  So  I've got to give credit to the NSA for using appropriate names on this. This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms. Boundless Informant is a program that the NSA hid from Congress. The NSA was previously asked by Congress  was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate of the amount of American communications that were being intercepted. They said no. They said  we don't track those stats  and we can't track those stats. We can't tell you how many communications we're intercepting around the world  because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy. Now  I really appreciate that sentiment from them  but the reality  when you look at this slide is  not only do they have the capability  the capability already exists. It's already in place. The NSA has its own internal data format that tracks both ends of a communication  and if it says  this communication came from America  they can tell Congress how many of those communications they have today  right now. And what Boundless Informant tells us is more communications are being intercepted in America about Americans than there are in Russia about Russians. I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency should be aiming for. CA  Ed  there was a story broken in the Washington Post  again from your data. The headline says   NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year.  Tell us about that. ES  We also heard in Congressional testimony last year  it was an amazing thing for someone like me who came from the NSA and who's seen the actual internal documents  knows what's in them  to see officials testifying under oath that there had been no abuses  that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules  when we knew this story was coming. But what's especially interesting about this  about the fact that the NSA has violated their own rules  their own laws thousands of times in a single year  including one event by itself  one event out of those        that affected more than       people. In another event  they intercepted all the calls in Washington  D.C.  by accident. What's amazing about this  this report  that didn't get that much attention  is the fact that not only were there       abuses  the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee  Dianne Feinstein  had not seen this report until the Washington Post contacted her asking for comment on the report. And she then requested a copy from the NSA and received it  but had never seen this before that. What does that say about the state of oversight in American intelligence when the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has no idea that the rules are being broken thousands of times every year  CA  Ed  one response to this whole debate is this  Why should we care about all this surveillance  honestly  I mean  look  if you've done nothing wrong  you've got nothing to worry about. What's wrong with that point of view  ES  Well  so the first thing is  you're giving up your rights. You're saying hey  you know  I don't think I'm going to need them  so I'm just going to trust that  you know  let's get rid of them  it doesn't really matter  these guys are going to do the right thing. Your rights matter because you never know when you're going to need them. Beyond that  it's a part of our cultural identity  not just in America  but in Western societies and in democratic societies around the world. People should be able to pick up the phone and to call their family  people should be able to send a text message to their loved ones  people should be able to buy a book online  they should be able to travel by train  they should be able to buy an airline ticket without wondering about how these events are going to look to an agent of the government  possibly not even your government years in the future  how they're going to be misinterpreted and what they're going to think your intentions were. We have a right to privacy. We require warrants to be based on probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion because we recognize that trusting anybody  any government authority  with the entirety of human communications in secret and without oversight is simply too great a temptation to be ignored. CA  Some people are furious at what you've done. I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite  Edward Snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog. He thinks you've committed one of the worst acts of betrayal in American history. What would you say to people who think that  ES  Dick Cheney's really something else. Thank you.  Laughter  I think it's amazing  because at the time Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work  Dick Cheney was saying he was going to end governments worldwide  the skies were going to ignite and the seas were going to boil off  and now he's saying it's a flea bite. So we should be suspicious about the same sort of overblown claims of damage to national security from these kind of officials. But let's assume that these people really believe this. I would argue that they have kind of a narrow conception of national security. The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney do not keep the nation safe. The public interest is not always the same as the national interest. Going to war with people who are not our enemy in places that are not a threat doesn't make us safe  and that applies whether it's in Iraq or on the Internet. The Internet is not the enemy. Our economy is not the enemy. American businesses  Chinese businesses  and any other company out there is a part of our society. It's a part of our interconnected world. There are ties of fraternity that bond us together  and if we destroy these bonds by undermining the standards  the security  the manner of behavior  that nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by. CA  But it's alleged that you've stolen  .  million documents. It seems only a few hundred of them have been shared with journalists so far. Are there more revelations to come  ES  There are absolutely more revelations to come. I don't think there's any question that some of the most important reporting to be done is yet to come. CA  Come here  because I want to ask you about this particular revelation. Come and take a look at this. I mean  this is a story which I think for a lot of the techies in this room is the single most shocking thing that they have heard in the last few months. It's about a program called  Bullrun.  Can you explain what that is  ES  So Bullrun  and this is again where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor  this is a program named after a Civil War battle. The British counterpart is called Edgehill  which is a U.K. civil war battle. And the reason that I believe they're named this way is because they target our own infrastructure. They're programs through which the NSA intentionally misleads corporate partners. They tell corporate partners that these are safe standards. They say hey  we need to work with you to secure your systems  but in reality  they're giving bad advice to these companies that makes them degrade the security of their services. They're building in backdoors that not only the NSA can exploit  but anyone else who has time and money to research and find it can then use to let themselves in to the world's communications. And this is really dangerous  because if we lose a single standard  if we lose the trust of something like SSL  which was specifically targeted by the Bullrun program  we will live a less safe world overall. We won't be able to access our banks and we won't be able to access commerce without worrying about people monitoring those communications or subverting them for their own ends. CA  And do those same decisions also potentially open America up to cyberattacks from other sources  ES  Absolutely. One of the problems  one of the dangerous legacies that we've seen in the post      era  is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats. They've been in charge of offensive operations  that is hacking  but they've also been in charge of defensive operations  and traditionally they've always prioritized defense over offense based on the principle that American secrets are simply worth more. If we hack a Chinese business and steal their secrets  if we hack a government office in Berlin and steal their secrets  that has less value to the American people than making sure that the Chinese can't get access to our secrets. So by reducing the security of our communications  they're not only putting the world at risk  they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way  because intellectual property is the basis  the foundation of our economy  and if we put that at risk through weak security  we're going to be paying for it for years. CA  But they've made a calculation that it was worth doing this as part of America's defense against terrorism. Surely that makes it a price worth paying. ES  Well  when you look at the results of these programs in stopping terrorism  you will see that that's unfounded  and you don't have to take my word for it  because we've had the first open court  the first federal court that's reviewed this  outside the secrecy arrangement  called these programs Orwellian and likely unconstitutional. Congress  who has access to be briefed on these things  and now has the desire to be  has produced bills to reform it  and two independent White House panels who reviewed all of the classified evidence said these programs have never stopped a single terrorist attack that was imminent in the United States. So is it really terrorism that we're stopping  Do these programs have any value at all  I say no  and all three branches of the American government say no as well. CA  I mean  do you think there's a deeper motivation for them than the war against terrorism  ES  I'm sorry  I couldn't hear you  say again  CA  Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation for them other than the war against terrorism  ES  Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism has always been what we in the intelligence world would call a cover for action. Terrorism is something that provokes an emotional response that allows people to rationalize authorizing powers and programs that they wouldn't give otherwise. The Bullrun and Edgehill type programs  the NSA asked for these authorities back in the     s. They asked the FBI to go to Congress and make the case. The FBI went to Congress and did make the case. But Congress and the American people said no. They said  it's not worth the risk to our economy. They said it's worth too much damage to our society to justify the gains. But what we saw is  in the post      era  they used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism to start these programs in secret without asking Congress  without asking the American people  and it's that kind of government behind closed doors that we need to guard ourselves against  because it makes us less safe  and it offers no value. CA  Okay  come with me here for a sec  because I've got a more personal question for you. Speaking of terror  most people would find the situation you're in right now in Russia pretty terrifying. You obviously heard what happened  what the treatment that Bradley Manning got  Chelsea Manning as now is  and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that there are people in the intelligence community who want you dead. How are you coping with this  How are you coping with the fear  ES  It's no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead. I've made clear again and again and again that I go to sleep every morning thinking about what I can do for the American people. I don't want to harm my government. I want to help my government  but the fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process  they're willing to declare guilt without ever seeing a trial  these are things that we need to work against as a society  and say hey  this is not appropriate. We shouldn't be threatening dissidents. We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism. And whatever part I can do to see that end  I'm happy to do despite the risks. CA  So I'd actually like to get some feedback from the audience here  because I know there's widely differing reactions to Edward Snowden. Suppose you had the following two choices  right  You could view what he did as fundamentally a reckless act that has endangered America or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act that will work towards America and the world's long term good  Those are the two choices I'll give you. I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with the first of those  that this was a reckless act  There are some hands going up. Some hands going up. It's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here  but I see them. ES  I can see you.  Laughter  CA  And who goes with the second choice  the fundamentally heroic act  And I think it's true to say that there are a lot of people who didn't show a hand and I think are still thinking this through  because it seems to me that the debate around you doesn't split along traditional political lines. It's not left or right  it's not really about pro government  libertarian  or not just that. Part of it is almost a generational issue. You're part of a generation that grew up with the Internet  and it seems as if you become offended at almost a visceral level when you see something done that you think will harm the Internet. Is there some truth to that  ES  It is. I think it's very true. This is not a left or right issue. Our basic freedoms  and when I say our  I don't just mean Americans  I mean people around the world  it's not a partisan issue. These are things that all people believe  and it's up to all of us to protect them  and to people who have seen and enjoyed a free and open Internet  it's up to us to preserve that liberty for the next generation to enjoy  and if we don't change things  if we don't stand up to make the changes we need to do to keep the Internet safe  not just for us but for everyone  we're going to lose that  and that would be a tremendous loss  not just for us  but for the world. CA  Well  I have heard similar language recently from the founder of the world wide web  who I actually think is with us  Sir Tim Berners Lee. Tim  actually  would you like to come up and say  do we have a microphone for Tim  Tim  good to see you. Come up there. Which camp are you in  by the way  traitor  hero  I have a theory on this  but    Tim Berners Lee  I've given much longer answers to that question  but hero  if I have to make the choice between the two. CA  And Ed  I think you've read the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet. Is that something that makes sense  ES  Absolutely. I mean  my generation  I grew up not just thinking about the Internet  but I grew up in the Internet  and although I never expected to have the chance to defend it in such a direct and practical manner and to embody it in this unusual  almost avatar manner  I think there's something poetic about the fact that one of the sons of the Internet has actually become close to the Internet as a result of their political expression. And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet is exactly what we need. We need to encode our values not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet  and it's something that I hope  I invite everyone in the audience  not just here in Vancouver but around the world  to join and participate in. CA  Do you have a question for Ed  TBL  Well  two questions  a general question   CA  Ed  can you still hear us  ES  Yes  I can hear you. CA  Oh  he's back. TBL  The wiretap on your line got a little interfered with for a moment. ES  It's a little bit of an NSA problem. TBL  So  from the    years  stepping back and thinking  what would you think would be the best that we could achieve from all the discussions that we have about the web we want  ES  When we think about in terms of how far we can go  I think that's a question that's really only limited by what we're willing to put into it. I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past has been exactly what we as not just a nation but as a people around the world need  and by cooperating  by engaging not just the technical parts of society  but as you said  the users  the people around the world who contribute through the Internet  through social media  who just check the weather  who rely on it every day as a part of their life  to champion that. We'll get not just the Internet we've had  but a better Internet  a better now  something that we can use to build a future that'll be better not just than what we hoped for but anything that we could have imagined. CA  It's    years ago that TED was founded      . A lot of the conversation since then has been along the lines that actually George Orwell got it wrong. It's not Big Brother watching us. We  through the power of the web  and transparency  are now watching Big Brother. Your revelations kind of drove a stake through the heart of that rather optimistic view  but you still believe there's a way of doing something about that. And you do too. ES  Right  so there is an argument to be made that the powers of Big Brother have increased enormously. There was a recent legal article at Yale that established something called the Bankston Soltani Principle  which is that our expectation of privacy is violated when the capabilities of government surveillance have become cheaper by an order of magnitude  and each time that occurs  we need to revisit and rebalance our privacy rights. Now  that hasn't happened since the government's surveillance powers have increased by several orders of magnitude  and that's why we're in the problem that we're in today  but there is still hope  because the power of individuals have also been increased by technology. I am living proof that an individual can go head to head against the most powerful adversaries and the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win  and I think that's something that we need to take hope from  and we need to build on to make it accessible not just to technical experts but to ordinary citizens around the world. Journalism is not a crime  communication is not a crime  and we should not be monitored in our everyday activities. CA  I'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot  but I imagine it's  this is the hand right here. TBL  That'll come very soon. ES  Nice to meet you  and I hope my beam looks as nice as my view of you guys does. CA  Thank you  Tim. I mean  The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you. Would you welcome the chance to come back to America  ES  Absolutely. There's really no question  the principles that have been the foundation of this project have been the public interest and the principles that underly the journalistic establishment in the United States and around the world  and I think if the press is now saying  we support this  this is something that needed to happen  that's a powerful argument  but it's not the final argument  and I think that's something that public should decide. But at the same time  the government has hinted that they want some kind of deal  that they want me to compromise the journalists with which I've been working  to come back  and I want to make it very clear that I did not do this to be safe. I did this to do what was right  and I'm not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself. CA  In the meantime  courtesy of the Internet and this technology  you're here  back in North America  not quite the U.S.  Canada  in this form. I'm curious  how does that feel  ES  Canada is different than what I expected. It's a lot warmer. CA  At TED  the mission is  ideas worth spreading.  If you could encapsulate it in a single idea  what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment  ES  I would say the last year has been a reminder that democracy may die behind closed doors  but we as individuals are born behind those same closed doors  and we don't have to give up our privacy to have good government. We don't have to give up our liberty to have security. And I think by working together we can have both open government and private lives  and I look forward to working with everyone around the world to see that happen. Thank you very much. CA  Ed  thank you. What's the scariest thing you've ever done  Or another way to say it is  what's the most dangerous  thing that you've ever done  And why did you do it  I know what the most dangerous thing is that I've ever done because NASA does the math. You look back to the first five shuttle launches  the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine. And even when I first flew in the shuttle back in          shuttle flight  the odds were still now that we look back about one in    or so    one in     one in   . Not great odds  so it's a really interesting day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center and you're going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day you're either going to be floating  effortlessly  gloriously in space  or you'll be dead. You go into  at the Kennedy Space Center  the suit up room  the same room that our childhood heroes got dressed in  that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon. And I got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad    in the Astro van    heading out to the launchpad  and as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center  it's normally predawn  and in the distance  lit up by the huge xenon lights  is your spaceship    the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet. The crew is sitting in the Astro van sort of hushed  almost holding hands  looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger. We ride the elevator up and we crawl in  on your hands and knees into the spaceship  one at a time  and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back. And the hatch is closed  and suddenly  what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real  something that I dreamed about  in fact  that I chose to do when I was nine years old  is now suddenly within not too many minutes of actually happening. In the astronaut business    the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle  it's the most complicated flying machine ever built. And in the astronaut business   we have a saying  which is  there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse. And so you're very conscious in the cockpit  you're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do  all the switches and all the  wickets you have to go through. And as the time gets closer and closer  this excitement is building. And then about three and a  half minutes before launch  the huge nozzles on the back  like the size of big church bells  swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle  like the vehicle is alive underneath you  like an elephant getting up  off its knees or something. And then about    seconds before launch  the vehicle is completely alive    it is ready to go    the APUs are running  the computers are all self contained  it's ready to leave the planet. And    seconds before launch  this happens  nine  eight  seven  six       start  two  one  booster ignition  and liftoff of  the space shuttle Discovery  returning to the space station  paving the way ... Chris Hadfield  It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things. You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself. It's shaking you so hard you can't focus on the instruments in front of you. It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog and there's a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space  accelerating wildly straight up  shouldering your way through the air  and you're in a very complex place    paying attention  watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face. After two minutes  those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines  the hydrogen and oxygen  and it's as if you're in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you've never accelerated. You get lighter and lighter  the force gets on us heavier and heavier. It feels like someone's pouring cement on you or something. Until finally  after about eight minutes and    seconds or so  we are finally at exactly the right altitude  exactly the right speed  the right direction  the engine shut off  and we're weightless. And we're alive. It's an amazing experience. But why would we take that risk  Why would you do something that dangerous  In my case the answer is fairly straightforward. I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do. I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me  it was just an obvious thing    I want to somehow turn myself into that. But the real question is  how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it  How do you deal with fear versus danger  And having the goal in mind  thinking about where it might lead  directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible  to be able to launch and go  help build a space station where you are on board a million pound creation that's going around the world at five miles a second  eight kilometers a second  around the world    times a day  with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running     experiments inside. But maybe even more importantly  allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means  to be able to look down and have    if your jaw could drop  it would    the jaw dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self propelled art gallery of fantastic  constantly changing beauty that is the world itself. And you see  because of the speed  a sunrise or a sunset every    minutes for half a year. And the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk. You are in a one person spaceship that is your spacesuit  and you're going through space with the world. It's an entirely different perspective  you're not looking up at the universe  you and the Earth are going  through the universe together. And you're holding on with one hand  looking at the world turn beside you. It's roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you. And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything  it's unfathomable blackness  with a texture you feel like you  could stick your hand into. and you are holding on with one hand  one link to the other seven billion people. And I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went blind  and I didn't know why. Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working. I was thinking  what do I do next  I thought  well maybe that's why we have two eyes  so I kept working. But unfortunately  without gravity  tears don't fall. So you just get a bigger and  bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually  the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it  across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes  goosh  into your other eye  and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship. So what's the scariest thing you've ever done  Maybe it's spiders. A lot of people are afraid of spiders. I think you should be afraid of spiders    spiders are creepy and they've got long  hairy legs  and spiders like this one  the brown recluse    it's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you  you end with one of these  horrible  big necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the chair behind you  in fact. And how do you know  And so a spider lands on you  and you go through this great  spasmy attack because spiders are scary. But then you could say  well  is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not  I don't know. Are there brown recluses here  So if you actually do the research  you find out that in the world there are about         different types of spiders  and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of       . And if you're in Canada  because of the cold winters here in B.C.  there's about           different types of spiders and there's one    one    that is venomous  and its venom isn't even fatal  it's just kind of like a nasty sting. And that spider    not only that  but that spider has beautiful markings on it  it's like  I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation  symbol on my back  it's the black widow.  So  if you're even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider    and it lives close the ground  you're walking along  you are  never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you. Spider webs like this  it doesn't build those  it builds them down in the corners. And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male  it doesn't care about you. So in fact  the next time you walk into a spiderweb  you don't need to panic and go  with your caveman reaction. The danger is entirely different than the fear. How do you get around it  though  How do you change your behavior  Well  next time you see a spiderweb  have a good look  make sure  it's not a black widow spider  and then walk into it. And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one. It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal. And the spider that may come out is  no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly. And then I guarantee you if you  walk through     spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior  your caveman reaction  and you will now be able to walk  in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb    or into your grandma's attic or whatever  into your own basement. And you can apply this to anything. If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded  your natural reaction would be to panic  I think. It would make you nervous and worried. But we had considered all the venom  and we had practiced with a whole  variety of different spiderwebs. We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times. And we don't just practice things going right  we practice things going wrong all the time  so that you are constantly walking  through those spiderwebs. And not just underwater  but  also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it's realistic. So when you finally actually  get outside on a spacewalk  it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time. And even if you're blinded  your natural  panicky reaction doesn't happen. Instead you kind of look around and go   Okay  I can't see  but I can hear  I can talk  Scott Parazynski is out here with me. He could come over and help me.  We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue  so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to. I could find my own way back. It's not nearly as big a deal. And actually  if you keep on crying for a while  whatever that gunk was that's  in your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again  and Houston  if you negotiate with them  they will let you then keep working. We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside  Jeff got some cotton batting and took  the crusty stuff around my eyes  and it turned out it was just the anti fog  sort of a mixture of oil and soap  that got in my eye. And now we use Johnson's No More Tears  which we probably should've been using right from the very beginning.  Laughter  But the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger  where is the real risk  What is the real thing that you should be afraid of  Not just a generic fear of bad things happening. You can fundamentally change  your reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you ... where you could see the  hardpan south of the Sahara  or you can see New York City in a way that is almost dreamlike  or the unconscious gingham  of Eastern Europe fields or the Great Lakes as a collection of small puddles. You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge  just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear. You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened. It's time to come home at the end. This is our spaceship  the Soyuz  that little one. Three of us climb in  and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere. These two parts here actually melt  we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere. The only part that survives is the little bullet that we're riding in  and it falls into the atmosphere  and in essence you are riding a meteorite home  and riding meteorites is scary  and it ought to be. But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming  like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth     Laughter     instead     years previously we had started studying Russian  and then once you learn Russian  then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian  and then we learned vehicle control theory  and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again. And in fact  you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a    kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth. So in fact  when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz  we weren't screaming  we were laughing  it was fun. And when the great big parachute opened  we knew that if it didn't open there's a second parachute  and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism. So we came back  we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz  in Kazakhstan. search and recovery helicopters  once again that helicopter part of dozen such Russian Mi   helicopters. Touchdown         and    seconds  a.m. Central Time. CH  And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your  spaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end  but you're ready for it you're in a custom built seat  you know how the shock absorber works. And then eventually the Russians reach in  drag you out  plunk you into a chair  and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience. You have taken the dreams of that nine year old boy  which were impossible and dauntingly scary  dauntingly terrifying  and put them into practice  and figured out a way to reprogram yourself  to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise. Just to finish  they asked me to play that guitar. I know this song  and it's really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself  but it's also  I think  a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe  we are people  and we're taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self perception into a new place.   This is Major Tom to ground control     I've left forevermore     And I'm floating in a most peculiar way     And the stars look very different today     For here am I floating in the tin can     A last glimpse of the world     Planet Earth is blue and  there's so much left to do   Fear not. That's very nice of you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I've come here today to talk to you about a problem. It's a very simple yet devastating problem  one that spans the globe and is affecting all of us. The problem is anonymous companies. It sounds like a really dry and technical thing  doesn't it  But anonymous companies are making it difficult and sometimes impossible to find out the actual human beings responsible sometimes for really terrible crimes. So  why am I here talking to all of you  Well  I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and I to question authority  I don't think they knew where it might lead. And  they probably really regretted it during my stroppy teenage years when  predictably  I questioned their authority a lot. And a lot of my school teachers didn't appreciate it much either. You see  since the age of about five I've always asked the question  but why  But why does the Earth go around the sun  But why is blood red  But why do I have to go to school  But why do I have to respect the teachers and authority  And little did I realize that this question would become the basis of everything I would do. And so it was in my twenties  a long time ago  that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London I was sitting with Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley and we were busy stuffing envelopes for a mail out in the office of the campaign group where we worked at the time. And as usual  we were talking  about the world's problems. And in particular  we were talking about the civil war in Cambodia. And we had talked about that  many  many times before. But then suddenly we stopped and looked at each other and said  but why don't we try and change this  And from that slightly crazy question  over two decades and many campaigns later  including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war  from that crazy question  Global Witness is now an    strong team of campaigners  investigators   journalists and lawyers. And we're all driven by the same belief  that change really is possible. So  what exactly does Global Witness do  We investigate  we report  to uncover the people really responsible for funding conflict    for stealing millions from citizens around the world  also known as state looting  and for destroying the environment. And then we campaign hard to  change the system itself. And we're doing this because  so many of the countries rich in natural resources like oil or diamonds or timber are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet. And much of this injustice is made possible by currently accepted business practices. And one of these is anonymous companies. Now we've come up against anonymous companies in lots of our investigations  like in the Democratic Republic of Congo  where we exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies had deprived the citizens of one of the poorest countries on the planet of well over a billion dollars. That's twice the country's health  and education budget combined. Or in Liberia  where an international predatory logging company used front companies as it attempted to grab a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests. Or political corruption in Sarawak  Malaysia  which has led to the destruction  of much of its forests. Well  that uses anonymous companies too. We secretly filmed some of the family of the former chief minister and a lawyer as they told our undercover investigator exactly how these dubious deals are done using such companies. And the awful thing is  there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life. This truly is a scandal of epic proportions hidden in plain sight. Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel  the Zetas  who use anonymous companies  to launder profits while their drugs related violence is tearing communities apart across the Americas. Or the anonymous company  which bought up Americans' tax debts  piled on the legal fees and then gave homeowners a choice  Pay up or lose your home. Imagine being threatened with losing your home sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars  and not being able to find out who you were really up against. Now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too. As the Iranian government found out when  through a series of front companies  it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan  on Fifth Avenue  despite American sanctions. And Juicy Couture  home of of the velvet track suit  and other companies were the unwitting  unknowing tenants there. There are just so many examples  the horesemeat scandal in Europe  the Italian mafia  they've used these companies for decades. The      million American Medicare fraud  the supply of weapons to wars around the world including those in Eastern Europe in the early '  s. Anonymous companies have even come to light in the recent revolution in the Ukraine. But  for every case that we and others expose there are so many more that will remain hidden away because of the current system. And it's just a simple truth that some of the people responsible  for outrageous crimes  for stealing from you and me and millions of others  they are remaining faceless and they are escaping accountability and they're doing this with ease  and they're doing it using legal structures. And really  that is unfair. Well  you might well ask  what exactly is an anonymous company  and can I really set one up  and use it  without anyone knowing who I am  Well  the answer is  yes you can. But if you're anything like me  you'll want to see some of that for yourself  so let me show you. Well first you need to work out where you want to set it up. Now  at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens but here's the thing  shockingly  my own hometown  London  and indeed the U.K.  is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company. And the other  even better  I'm afraid that's America. Do you know  in some states across America you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card  like Delaware  which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company. Okay  so let's say it's America  and let's say it's Delaware  and now you can simply go online and find yourself a company service provider. These are the companies that  can set your one up for you  and remember  it's all legal  routine business practice. So  here's one  but there are plenty of others to choose from. And having made your choice  you then pick what type of company you want and then fill in a contact  name and address. But don't worry  it doesn't have to be your name. It can be your lawyer's or your service provider's  and it's not for the public record anyway. And then you add the owner of the company. Now this is the key part  and again it doesn't have to be you  because you can get creative  because there is a whole universe  out there of nominees to choose from. And nominees are the people that you can legally pay to be your company's owner. And if you don't want to involve anyone else  it doesn't even have to be an actual human being. It could be another company. And then finally  give your company a name add a few more details and make your payment. And then the service provider will take a few hours or more to process it. But there you are  in    minutes of online shopping you can create yourself an anonymous company. And not only is it easy  really  really easy and cheap  it's totally legal too. But the fun doesn't have to end there  maybe you want to be even more anonymous. Well  that's no problem either. You can simply keep adding layers  companies owned by companies. You can have hundreds of layers with hundreds of companies spread across lots of different countries  like a giant web  each layer adds anonymity. Each layer makes it more difficult for law enforcement and others to find out who the real owner is. But whose interests is this all serving  It might be in the interests of the company or a particular individual  but what about all of us  the public  There hasn't even been a global conversation yet about whether it's okay to misuse companies in this way. And what does it all mean for us  Well  an example that really haunts me is one I came across recently. And it's that of a horrific fire in a nightclub in Buenos Aires about a decade ago. It was the night before New Year's Eve. Three thousand very happy revelers  many of them teenagers  were crammed into a space meant for      . And then tragedy struck  a fire broke out plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling and toxic smoke filled the club. So people tried to escape only to find that some of the fire doors had been chained shut. Over     people died. Seven hundred were injured trying to get out. And as the victims' families  and the city and the country reeled in shock  investigators tried to find out who was responsible. And as they looked for the owners of the club  they found instead anonymous companies  and confusion surrounded the identities of those involved with the companies. Now ultimately  a range of people were charged and some went to jail. But this was an awful tragedy  and it shouldn't have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths. Because in an age when there is so much information out there in the open  why should this crucial information about company ownership stay hidden away  Why should tax evaders  corrupt  government officials  arms traders and more  be able to hide their identities from us  the public  Why should this secrecy be such  an accepted business practice  Anonymous companies might be the norm right now but it wasn't always this way. Companies were created to give people a chance to innovate and not have to put everything on the line. Companies were created to limit financial risk  they were never intended to  be used as a moral shield. Companies were never intended to be anonymous  and they don't have to be. And so I come to my wish. My wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good. Together let's ignite world opinion  change the law  and launch a new era of openness in business. So what might this look like  Well  imagine if you could go online and look up the real owner of a company. Imagine if this data were open and free  accessible across borders for citizens and businesses and law enforcement alike. Imagine what a game changer that would be. So how are we going to do this  Well  there is only one way. Together  we have to change the law globally to create public registries which list the true owners of companies and can be accessed by all with no loopholes. And yes  this is ambitious  but there is momentum on this issue  and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum  and it's just starting on this issue. There is such an opportunity right now. And the TED community of creative and innovative thinkers and doers across all of society could make the crucial difference. You really can make this change happen. Now  a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word. It's going to be a springboard for our global campaigning. And the techies among you  you could really help us create a prototype public registry to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be. Campaign groups from around the world have come together to work on this issue. The U.K. government is already on board  it supports these public registries. And just last week  the European Parliament came on board with a vote     to    in favor of public registries. That is momentum. But it's early days. America still needs to come on board  as do so many other countries. And to succeed we will all together need to help and push our politicians  because without that  real far reaching  world shifting change just isn't going to happen. Because this isn't just about changing the law  this is about starting a conversation about what it's okay for companies to do  and in what ways is it acceptable  to use company structures. This isn't just a dry policy issue. This is a human issue which affects us all. This is about being on the right side of history. Global citizens  innovators   business leaders  individuals  we need you. Together  let's kickstart this global movement. Let's just do it  let's end anonymous companies. Thank you. Chris Anderson  We had Edward Snowden here a couple days ago  and this is response time. And several of you have written to me with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA. So Richard Ledgett is the   th deputy director of the National Security Agency  and he's a senior civilian officer there  acts as its chief operating officer  guiding strategies  setting internal policies  and serving as the principal advisor to the director. And all being well  welcome  Rick Ledgett  to TED. Richard Ledgett  I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here. I look forward to the conversation  so thanks for arranging for that. CA  Thank you  Rick. We appreciate you joining us. It's certainly quite a strong statement that the NSA is willing to reach out and show a more open face here. You saw  I think  the talk and interview that Edward Snowden gave here a couple days ago. What did you make of it  RL  So I think it was interesting. We didn't realize that he  was going to show up there  so kudos to you guys for arranging a nice surprise like that. I think that  like a lot of the things that have come out since Mr. Snowden started disclosing classified information  there were some kernels of truth in there  but a lot of extrapolations and half truths in there  and I'm interested in helping to address those. I think this is a really important conversation that we're having in the United States and internationally  and I think it is important and of import  and so given that  we need to have that be a fact based conversation  and we want to help make that happen. CA  So the question that a lot  of people have here is  what do you make of Snowden's motivations for doing what he did  and did he have an alternative way that he could have gone  RL  He absolutely did have alternative ways that he could have gone  and I actually think that characterizing him as a whistleblower actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities. So what if somebody who works in the NSA    and there are over        people who do. They're all great citizens. They're just like your husbands  fathers  sisters  brothers  neighbors  nephews  friends and relatives  all of whom are interested in doing the right thing for their country and for our allies internationally  and so there are a variety of venues to address if folks have a concern. First off  there's their supervisor  and up through the supervisory chain within their organization. If folks aren't comfortable with that  there are a number of inspectors general. In the case of Mr. Snowden  he had the option of the NSA inspector general  the Navy inspector general  the Pacific Command inspector general  the Department of Defense inspector general  and the intelligence community inspector general  any of whom would have both kept his concerns in classified channels and been happy to address them. He had the option to go to congressional committees  and there are mechanisms to do that that are in place  and so he didn't do any of those things. CA  Now  you had said that Ed Snowden had other avenues for raising his concerns. The comeback on that is a couple of things  one  that he certainly believes that as a contractor  the avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren't available  two  there's a track record of other whistleblowers  like  Thomas Andrews Drake  being treated pretty harshly  by some views  and thirdly  what he was taking on was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered  but programs that had been approved by all three branches of government. I mean  in that circumstance  couldn't you argue that what he did was reasonable  RL  No  I don't agree with that. I think that the   sorry  I'm getting feedback through the microphone there   the actions that he took were inappropriate because of the fact that  he put people's lives at risk  basically  in the long run  and I know there's been a lot of talk in public by Mr. Snowden and some of the journalists that say that the things that have been disclosed have not put national security and people at risk  and that is categorically not true. They actually do. I think there's also an amazing arrogance to the idea that he knows better than the framers of the Constitution in how the government should  be designed and work for separation of powers and the fact that the executive  and the legislative branch have to work together and they have checks and balances on each other  and then the judicial branch  which oversees the entire process. I think that's extremely arrogant on his part. CA  Can you give a specific example of how he put people's lives at risk  RL  Yeah  sure. So the things that he's disclosed  the capabilities  and the NSA is a capabilities based organization  so when we have foreign intelligence targets  legitimate things of interest    like  terrorists is the iconic example  but it includes things like human traffickers  drug traffickers  people who are trying to build advanced weaponry  nuclear weapons  and build delivery systems for those  and nation states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors  which you may have some visibility into some of that that's going on right now  the capabilities are applied in very discrete and measured and controlled ways. So the unconstrained disclosure  of those capabilities means that as adversaries see them and recognize   Hey  I might be vulnerable to this   they move away from that  and we have seen targets in terrorism  in the nation state area  in smugglers of various types  and other folks who have  because of the disclosures  moved away from our ability to have insight into what they're doing. The net effect of that is that our people who are overseas in dangerous places  whether they're diplomats or military  and our allies who are in similar situations  are at greater risk because we don't see the threats that are coming their way. CA  So that's a general response saying that because of his revelations  access that you had to certain types of information has been shut down  has been closed down. But the concern is that the nature of that access was not necessarily legitimate in the first place. I mean  describe to us this Bullrun program where it's alleged that the NSA specifically weakened security in order to get the type of  access that you've spoken of. RL  So there are  when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before  use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology  and they do  because it's a great system  it's the most complex system ever devised by man  and it is a wonder  and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that  and it's just a wonderful thing. But it's also used by people who are working against us and our allies. And so if I'm going to pursue them  I need to have the capability to go after them  and again  the controls are in how I apply that capability  not that I have the capability itself. Otherwise  if we could make it so that all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet  we could have a domain  badguy.com. That would be awesome  and we could just concentrate all our efforts there. That's not how it works. They're trying to hide from the government's ability to isolate and interdict their actions  and so we have to swim in that same space. But I will tell you this. So NSA has two missions. One is the Signals Intelligence mission that we've unfortunately read so much about in the press. The other one is the Information Assurance mission  which is to protect the national security systems of the United States  and by that  that's things like the communications that the president uses  the communications that control our nuclear weapons  the communications that our military uses around the world  and the communications that we use with our allies  and that some of our allies themselves use. And so we make recommendations on standards to use  and we use those same standards  and so we are invested in making sure that those communications are secure for their intended purposes. CA  But it sounds like what you're saying is that when it comes to the Internet at large  any strategy is fair game if it improves America's safety. And I think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion  that there's a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the Internet. They think of it as a momentous invention of humanity  kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press  for example. It's the bringer of knowledge to all. It's the connector of all. And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms. And from that lens  what the NSA has done is equivalent to the authorities back in Germany inserting some device into every printing press that would reveal which books people bought and what they read. Can you understand that from that viewpoint  it feels outrageous  RL  I do understand that  and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet  and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet. It is a global telecommunications system. The Internet is a big chunk of  that  but there is a lot more. And I think that people have legitimate concerns about the balance between transparency and secrecy. That's sort of been couched as a balance between privacy and national security. I don't think that's the right framing. I think it really is transparency and secrecy. And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having  and we want to participate in that  and want people to participate in it in an informed way. So there are things  let me talk there a little bit more  there are things that we need to be transparent about  our authorities  our processes  our oversight  who we are. We  NSA  have not done a good job of that  and I think that's part of the reason that this has been so revelational and so sensational in the media. Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency  the Never Say Anything. There's takeoffs of our logo of an eagle with headphones on around it. And so that's the public characterization. And so we need to be more transparent about those things. What we don't need to be transparent about  because it's bad for the U.S.  it's bad for all those other countries that we work with and that we help provide information that helps them secure themselves and their people  it's bad to expose operations and capabilities in a way that allows the people that we're all working against  the generally recognized bad guys  to counter those. CA  But isn't it also bad to deal a kind of body blow to the American companies that have essentially given the world most of the Internet services that matter  RL  It is. It's really the companies are in a tough position  as are we  because the companies  we compel them to provide information  just like every other nation in the world does. Every industrialized nation in the world has a lawful intercept program where they are requiring companies to provide them with information that they need for their security  and the companies that are involved have complied with those programs in the same way that they have to do when they're operating in Russia or the U.K. or China or India or France  any country that you choose to name. And so the fact that these revelations have been broadly characterized as  you can't trust company A because your privacy is suspect with them  is actually only accurate in the sense that it's accurate with every other company in the world that deals with any of those countries in the world. And so it's being picked up by people as a marketing advantage  and it's being marketed that  way by several countries  including some of our allied countries  where they are saying   Hey  you can't trust the U.S.  but you can trust our telecom company  because we're safe.  And they're actually using that to counter the very large technological edge that U.S. companies have in areas like the cloud and Internet based technologies. CA  You're sitting there with the American flag  and the American Constitution guarantees freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. How do you characterize the American citizen's right to privacy  Is there such a right  RL  Yeah  of course there is. And we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure  inordinate and appropriate  actually I should say  amount of time and effort in order to ensure that we protect that privacy. and beyond that  the privacy of citizens around the world  it's not just Americans. Several things come into play here. First  we're all in the same network. My communications  I'm a user of a particular Internet email service that is the number one email service of choice by terrorists around the world  number one. So I'm there right beside them in email space in the Internet. And so we need to be able to pick that apart and find the information that's relevant. In doing so  we're going to necessarily encounter Americans and innocent foreign citizens who are just going about their business  and so we have procedures in place that shreds that out  that says  when you find that  not if you find it  when you find it  because you're certain to find it  here's how you protect that. These are called minimization procedures. They're approved by the attorney general and constitutionally based. And so we protect those. And then  for people  citizens of the world who are going about their lawful business on a day to day basis  the president on his January    speech  laid out some additional protections that we are providing to them. So I think absolutely  folks do have a right to privacy  and that we work very hard to make sure that that right to privacy is protected. CA  What about foreigners using American companies' Internet services  Do they have any privacy rights  RL  They do. They do  in the sense of  the only way that we are able to compel one of those companies to provide us information is when it falls into one of three categories  We can identify that this particular person  identified by a selector of some kind  is associated with counterterrorist or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target. CA  Much has been made of the fact that a lot of the information that you've obtained through these programs is essentially metadata. It's not necessarily the actual words that someone has written in an email or given on a phone call. It's who they wrote to and when  and so forth. But it's been argued  and someone here in the audience has talked to a former NSA analyst who said metadata is actually much more invasive than the core data  because in the core data you present yourself as you want to be presented. With metadata  who knows what the conclusions are that are drawn  Is there anything to that  RL  I don't really understand that argument. I think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons. Metadata is the information that lets you find connections that people are trying to hide. So when a terrorist is corresponding with somebody else who's not known to us but is engaged in doing or supporting terrorist activity  or someone who's violating international sanctions by providing nuclear weapons related material to a country like Iran or North Korea  is trying to hide that activity because it's illicit activity. What metadata lets you do is connect that. The alternative to that is one that's much less efficient and much more invasive of privacy  which is gigantic amounts of content collection. So metadata  in that sense  actually is privacy enhancing. And we don't  contrary to some of the stuff that's been printed  we don't sit there and grind out metadata profiles of average people. If you're not connected to one of those valid intelligence targets  you are not of interest to us. CA  So in terms of the threats that face America overall  where would you place terrorism  RL  I think terrorism is still number one. I think that we have never been in a time where there are more places where things are going badly and forming the petri dish in which terrorists take advantage of the lack of governance. An old boss of mine  Tom Fargo  Admiral Fargo  used to describe it as arcs of instability. And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability in the world right now  in places like Syria  where there's a civil war going on and you have massive numbers  thousands and thousands of foreign fighters who are coming into Syria to learn how to be terrorists and practice that activity  and lots of those people are Westerners who hold passports to European countries or in some cases the United States  and so they are basically learning how to do jihad and have expressed intent to go out and do that later on in their home countries. You've got places like Iraq  which is suffering from a high level of sectarian violence  again a breeding ground for terrorism. And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel area of Africa. Again  lots of weak governance which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity. So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one. I think number two is cyber threat. I think cyber is a threat in three ways  One way  and probably the most common way that people have heard about it  is due to the theft of intellectual property  so basically  foreign countries going in  stealing companies' secrets  and then providing that information to state owned enterprises or companies connected to the government to help them leapfrog technology or to gain business intelligence that's then used to win contracts overseas. That is a hugely costly set of activities that's going on right now. Several nation states are doing it. Second is the denial of service attacks. You're probably aware that there have been a spate of those directed against the U.S. financial sector since     . Again  that's a nation state who is executing those attacks  and they're doing that as a semi anonymous way of reprisal. And the last one is destructive attacks  and those are the ones that concern me the most. Those are on the rise. You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in       August of     . It took down about        of their computers with a Wiper style virus. You had a follow on a week later to a Qatari company. You had March of       you had a South Korean attack that was attributed in the press to North Korea that took out thousands of computers. Those are on the rise  and we see people expressing interest in those capabilities and a desire to employ them. CA  Okay  so a couple of things here  because this is really the core of this  almost. I mean  first of all  a lot of people who look at risk and look at the numbers don't understand this belief that terrorism is still the number one threat. Apart from September     I think the numbers are that in the last    or    years about     Americans have died from terrorism  mostly from homegrown terrorists. The chance in the last few years of being killed by terrorism is far less than the chance of being killed by lightning. I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident or bioterrorism act or something like that would change those numbers. Would that be the point of view  RL  Well  I'd say two things. One is  the reason that there hasn't been a major attack in the United States since       that is not an accident. That's a lot of hard work that we have done  that other folks in the intelligence community have done  that the military has done  and that our allies around the globe have done. You've heard the numbers about the tip of the iceberg in terms of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs contributed to stopping was        of those in Europe  and of those        of them occurred in three countries  some of which are our allies  and some of which are beating the heck out of us over the NSA programs  by the way. So that's not an accident that those things happen. That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence on terrorist activities and interdicting them through one way or another  through law enforcement  through cooperative activities with other countries and sometimes through military action. The other thing I would say is that your idea of nuclear or chem bio threat is not at all far fetched and in fact there are a number of groups who have for several years expressed interest and desire in obtaining those capabilities and work towards that. CA  It's also been said that  of those    alleged incidents  that as few as zero of them were actually anything to do with these controversial programs that Mr. Snowden revealed  that it was basically through other forms of intelligence  that you're looking for a needle in a haystack  and the effects of these programs  these controversial programs  is just to add hay to the stack  not to really find the needle. The needle was found by other methods. Isn't there something to that  RL  No  there's actually two programs that are typically implicated in that discussion. One is the section     program  the U.S. telephony metadata program  and the other one is popularly called the PRISM program  and it's actually section      of the FISA Amendment Act. But the     program is only relevant to threats that are directed against the United States  and there have been a dozen threats where that was implicated. Now what you'll see people say publicly is there is no  but for  case  and so there is no case where  but for that  the threat would have happened. But that actually indicates a lack of understanding of how terrorist investigations actually work. You think about on television  you watch a murder mystery. What do you start with  You start with a body  and then they work their way from there to solve the crime. We're actually starting well before that  hopefully before there are any bodies  and we're trying to build the case for who the people are  what they're trying to do  and that involves massive amounts of information. Think of it is as mosaic  and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic was necessary to building the mosaic  but to build the complete picture  you need to have all the pieces of information. On the other  the non U.S. related threats out of those     the other    of them  the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that  and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks. CA  Snowden said two days ago that terrorism has always been what is called in the intelligence world  a cover for action   that it's something that  because it invokes such a powerful emotional response in people  it allows the initiation of these programs to achieve powers that an organization like yours couldn't otherwise have. Is there any internal debate about that  RL  Yeah. I mean  we debate these things all the time  and there is discussion that goes on in the executive branch and within NSA itself and the intelligence community about what's right  what's proportionate  what's the correct thing to do. And it's important to note that the programs that we're talking about were all authorized by two different presidents  two different political parties  by Congress twice  and by federal judges    different times  and so this is not NSA running off and doing its own thing. This is a legitimate activity of the United States foreign government that was agreed to by all the branches of the United States government  and President Madison would have been proud. CA  And yet  when congressmen discovered what was actually being done  with that authorization  many of them were completely shocked. Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction  that it's only because it's now come out publicly  that they really knew exactly what you were doing with the powers they had granted you  RL  Congress is a big body. There's     of them  and they change out frequently  in the case of the House  every two years  and I think that the NSA provided all the relevant information to our oversight committees  and then the dissemination of that information by the oversight committees throughout Congress is something that they manage. I think I would say that Congress members had the opportunity to make themselves aware  and in fact a significant number of them  the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility  did have the ability to do that. And you've actually had the chairs of those committees say that in public. CA  Now  you mentioned the  threat of cyberattacks  and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree that that is a huge concern  but do you accept that there's a tradeoff between offensive and defensive strategies  and that it's possible that the very measures taken to   weaken encryption   and allow yourself to find the bad guys  might also open the door to forms of cyberattack  RL  So I think two things. One is  you said weaken encryption. I didn't. And the other one is that the NSA has both of those missions  and we are heavily biased towards defense  and  actually  the vulnerabilities that we find in the overwhelming majority of cases  we disclose to the people who are responsible for manufacturing or developing those products. We have a great track record of that  and we're actually working on a proposal right now to be transparent and to publish transparency reports in the same way that the Internet companies are being allowed to publish transparency reports for them. We want to be more transparent about that. So again  we eat our own dog food. We use the standards  we use the products that we recommend  and so it's in our interest to keep our communications protected in the same way that other people's need to be. CA  Edward Snowden  when  after his talk  was wandering the halls here in the bot  and I heard him say to a couple of people  they asked him about what he thought of the NSA overall  and he was very complimentary about the people who work with you  said that it's a really impassioned group of employees who are seeking to do the right thing  and that the problems have come from just some badly conceived policies. He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly. He didn't come over like a crazy man. Would you accept that at least  even if you disagree with how he did it  that he has opened a debate that matters  RL  So I think that the discussion is an important one to have. I do not like the way that he did it. I think there were a number of other ways that he could have done that that would have not endangered our people and the people of other nations through losing visibility into what our adversaries are doing. But I do think it's an important conversation. CA  It's been reported that there's almost a difference of opinion with you and your colleagues over any scenario in which he might be offered an amnesty deal. I think your boss  General Keith Alexander  has said that that would be a terrible example for others  you can't negotiate with someone who's broken the law in that way. But you've been quoted as saying that  if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering all undisclosed documents  that a deal maybe should be considered. Do you still think that  RL  Yeah  so actually  this is my favorite thing about that     Minutes  interview was all the misquotes that came from that. What I actually said  in  response to a question about  would you entertain any discussions of mitigating action against Snowden  I said  yeah  it's worth a conversation. This is something that the attorney general of the United States and the president also actually have both talked about this  and I defer to the attorney general  because this is his lane. But there is a strong tradition in American jurisprudence of having discussions with people who have been charged with crimes in order to  if it benefits the government  to get something out of that  that there's always room for that kind of discussion. So I'm not presupposing any outcome  but there is always room for discussion. CA  To a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the U.S.  the government  you  others  in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy  a smarter way forward for the future. Do you see  has that kind of possibility been entertained at all  RL  So that's out of my lane. That's not an NSA thing. That would be a Department of Justice sort of discussion. I'll defer to them. CA  Rick  when Ed Snowden ended his talk  I offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading. What would be your idea worth spreading for this group  RL  So I think  learn the facts. This is a really important conversation  and it impacts  it's not just NSA  it's not just the government  it's you  it's the Internet companies. The issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government  and so learn the facts. Don't rely on headlines  don't rely on sound bites  don't rely on one sided conversations. So that's the idea  I think  worth spreading. We have a sign  a badge tab  we wear badges at work with lanyards  and if I could make a plug  my badge lanyard at work says   Dallas Cowboys.  Go Dallas. I've just alienated half the audience  I know. So the lanyard that our people who work in the organization that does our crypto analytic work have a tab that says   Look at the data.  So that's the idea worth spreading. Look at the data. CA  Rick  it took a certain amount of courage  I think  actually  to come and speak openly to this group. It's not something the NSA has done a lot of in the past  and plus the technology has been challenging. We truly appreciate you doing that and sharing in this very important conversation. Thank you so much. RL  Thanks  Chris. Charlie Rose  So Larry sent me an email and he basically said  we've got to make sure that  we don't seem like we're a couple of middle aged boring men. I said  I'm flattered by that    because I'm a bit older  and he has a bit more net worth than I do. Larry Page  Well  thank you. CR  So we'll have a conversation about the Internet  and we'll have a conversation Google  and we'll have a conversation about search and privacy  and also about your philosophy and a sense of how you've connected the dots and how this journey that began some time ago has such interesting prospects. Mainly we want to talk about the future. So my first question  Where is Google and where is it going  LP  Well  this is something we think about a lot  and our mission we defined a long time ago is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And people always say  is that really what you guys are still doing  And I always kind of think about that myself  and I'm not quite sure. But actually  when I think about search  it's such a deep thing for all of us  to really understand what you want  to understand the world's information  and we're still very much in the early stages of that  which is totally crazy. We've been at it for    years already  but it's not at all done. CR  When it's done  how will it be  LP  Well  I guess  in thinking about where we're going    you know  why is it not done     a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess. You know  your computer doesn't know where you are  it doesn't know what you're doing  it doesn't know what you know  and a lot we've been trying to do recently is just make your devices work  make them understand your context. Google Now  you know  knows where you are  knows what you may need. So really having computing  work and understand you and understand that information  we really haven't done that yet. It's still very  very clunky. CR  Tell me  when you look at what Google is doing  where does Deep Mind fit  LP  Yeah  so Deep Mind is a company we just acquired recently. It's in the U.K. First  let me tell you the way we got there  which was looking at search and really understanding  trying to understand everything  and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you    like  voice was really important. So what's the state of the art  on speech recognition  It's not very good. It doesn't really understand you. So we started doing machine learning research to improve that. That helped a lot. And we started just looking at things like YouTube. Can we understand YouTube  But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats  just by itself. Now  that's an important concept. And we realized there's really something here. If we can learn what cats are  that must be really important. So I think Deep Mind  what's really amazing about Deep Mind is that it can actually    they're learning things in this unsupervised way. They started with video games  and really just  maybe I can show the video  just playing video games  and learning how to do that automatically. CR  Take a look at the video games and how machines are coming to be able to do some remarkable things. LP  The amazing thing about this is this is  I mean  obviously  these are old games  but the system just sees what you see  the pixels  and it has the controls and it has the score  and it's learned to play all of these games  same program. It's learned to play all of these games with superhuman performance. We've not been able to do things like this with computers before. And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly. This is boxing  and it figures out it can sort of pin the opponent down. The computer's on the left  and it's just racking up points. So imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule  or your information needs  or things like that. We're really just at the beginning of that  and that's what I'm really excited about. CR  When you look at all that's taken place with Deep Mind and the boxing  also a part of where we're going is artificial intelligence. Where are we  when you look at that  LP  Well  I think for me  this is kind of one of the most exciting things I've seen in a long time. The guy who started this company  Demis  has a neuroscience and a computer science background. He went back to school to get his Ph.D. to study the brain. And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things. CR  But where's the level of it now  And how fast do you think we are moving  LP  Well  this is the state of the art right now  understanding cats on YouTube and things like that  improving voice recognition. We used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally  but I think for me  this example's really exciting  because it's one program that can do a lot of different things. CR  I don't know if we can do this  but we've got the image of the cat. It would be wonderful to see this. This is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with. Can we see that image  LP  Yeah. CR  There it is. Can you see the cat  Designed by machines  seen by machines. LP  That's right. So this is learned from just watching YouTube. And there's no training  no notion of a cat  but this concept of a cat is something important that you would understand  and now that the machines can kind of understand. Maybe just finishing also on the search part  it started with search  really understanding people's context and their information. I did have a video I wanted to show quickly on that that we actually found. Zack Matere  Not long ago  I planted a crop of potatoes. Then suddenly they started dying one after the other. I checked out the books and  they didn't tell me much. So  I went and I did a search.   Zack Matere  Farmer   Potato diseases. One of the websites told me that ants could be the problem. It said  sprinkle wood ash over the plants. Then after a few days the ants disappeared. I got excited about the Internet. I have this friend who really would like to expand his business. So I went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites. When I met him next  he was going to put a windmill at the local school. I felt proud because something that wasn't there before was suddenly there. I realized that not everybody can be able to access what I was able to access. I thought that I need to have an Internet that my grandmother can use. So I thought about a notice board. A simple wooden notice board. When I get information on my phone  I'm able to post the information on the notice board. So it's basically like a computer. I use the Internet to help people. I think I am searching for a better life for me and my neighbors. So many people have access to information  but there's no follow up to that. I think the follow up to that is our knowledge. When people have the knowledge  they can find solutions without having to helped out. Information is powerful  but it is how we use it that will define us. LP  Now  the amazing thing about that video  actually  was we just read about it in the news  and we found this gentlemen  and made that little clip. CR  When I talk to people about you  they say to me  people who know you well  say  Larry wants to change the world  and he believes technology can show the way. And that means access to the Internet. It has to do with languages. It also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community  and this is an example. LP  Yeah  that's right  and I think for me  I have been focusing on access more  if we're talking about the future. We recently released this Loon Project which is using balloons to do it. It sounds totally crazy. We can show the video here. Actually  two out of three people in the world don't have good Internet access now. We actually think this can really help people sort of cost efficiently. CR  It's a balloon. LP  Yeah  get access to the Internet. CR  And why does this balloon give you access to the Internet  Because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible  they didn't have to be tethered. LP  Yeah  and this is a good example of innovation. Like  we've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it  but it was just really  how do we get access points up high  cheaply  You normally have to use satellites and it takes a long time to launch them. But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up  and actually again  it's the power of the Internet  I did a search on it  and I found         years ago  someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the Earth multiple times. And I thought  why can't we do that today  And that's how this project got going. CR  But are you at the mercy of the wind  LP  Yeah  but it turns out  we did some weather simulations which probably hadn't really been done before  and if you control the altitude of the balloons  which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways  you can actually control roughly where they go  and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet. CR  Before I talk about the future and transportation  where you've been a nerd for a while  and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles  let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here earlier with Edward Snowden. It is security and privacy. You have to have been thinking about that. LP  Yeah  absolutely. I saw the picture of Sergey with Edward Snowden yesterday. Some of you may have seen it. But I think  for me  I guess  privacy and security are a really important thing. We think about it in terms of both things  and I think you can't have privacy without security  so let me just talk about security first  because you asked about Snowden and all of that  and then I'll say a little bit about privacy. I think for me  it's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us. I don't think we can have a democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government for stuff that we've never had a conversation about. And I don't mean we have to know what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried about protecting us from  but we do need to know what the parameters of it is  what kind of surveillance the government's going to do and how and why  and I think we haven't had that conversation. So I think the government's actually done itself a tremendous disservice by doing all that in secret. CR  Never coming to Google to ask for anything. LP  Not Google  but the public. I think we need to  have a debate about that  or we can't have a functioning democracy. It's just not possible. So I'm sad that Google's in the position of protecting you and our users from the government doing secret thing that nobody knows about. It doesn't make any sense. CR  Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it. LP  Yes. The privacy side  I think it's    the world is changing. You carry a phone. It knows where you are. There's so much more information about you  and that's an important thing  and it makes sense why people are asking difficult questions. We spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are. I'm a little bit    I think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice  show them what data's being collected    search history  location data. We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome  and doing that in more ways  just giving people more choice and more awareness of what's going on. I also think it's very easy. What I'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater. And I look at  on your show  actually  I kind of lost my voice  and I haven't gotten it back. I'm hoping that by talking to you I'm going to get it back. CR  If I could do anything  I would do that. LP  All right. So get out your voodoo doll and whatever you need to do. But I think  you know what  I look at that  I made that public  and I got all this information. We got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues  and I look at medical records  and I say  wouldn't it be amazing if everyone's medical records were available anonymously to research doctors  And when someone accesses your medical record  a research doctor  they could see  you could see which doctor accessed it and why  and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have. I think if we just did that  we'd save         lives this year. CR  Absolutely. Let me go    Applause  LP  So I guess I'm just very worried that with Internet privacy  we're doing the same thing we're  doing with medical records  is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater  and we're not really thinking about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways. CR  And the necessary condition that people have to have confidence that their information will not be abused. LP  Yeah  and I had this problem with my voice stuff. I was scared to share it. Sergey encouraged me to do that  and it was a great thing to do. CR  And the response has been overwhelming. LP  Yeah  and people are super positive. We got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions  which there's no data on today. So it was a really good thing. CR  So talking about the future  what is it about you and transportation systems  LP  Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated with this when I was at college in Michigan. I had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it. And it was cold and snowing. I did some research on how much it cost  and I just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems. CR  And that began the idea of an automated car. LP  Yeah  about    years ago I learned about people working on automated cars  and I became fascinated by that  and it takes a while to  get these projects going  but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that improving the world. There's    million people or more injured per year. It's the leading cause of death for people under    in the U.S. CR  So you're talking about saving lives. LP  Yeah  and also saving space and making life better. Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads  half of the area  and most cities are not far behind  actually. It's just crazy that that's what we use our space for. CR  And how soon will we be there  LP  I think we can be there very  very soon. We've driven well over         miles now totally automated. I'm super excited about getting that out quickly. CR  But it's not only you're talking about automated cars. You also have this idea for bicycles. LP  Well at Google  we got this idea that we should just provide free bikes to everyone  and that's been amazing  most of the trips. You see bikes going everywhere  and the bikes wear out. They're getting used    hours a day. CR  But you want to put them above the street  too. LP  Well I said  how do we get people using bikes more  CR  We may have a video here. LP  Yeah  let's show the video. I just got excited about this. So this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost. Anyway  it looks totally crazy  but I was actually thinking about our campus  working with the Zippies and stuff  and just trying to get a lot more bike usage  and I was thinking about  how do you cost effectively separate the bikes from traffic  And I went and searched  and this is what I found. And we're not actually working on this  that particular thing  but it gets your imagination going. CR  Let me close with this. Give me a sense of the philosophy  of your own mind. You have this idea of  Google X . You don't simply want to go in some small  measurable arena of progress. LP  Yeah  I think many of the things we just  talked about are like that  where they're really    I almost use the economic concept of additionality  which means that you're doing something that wouldn't happen unless  you were actually doing it. And I think the more you can do things like that  the bigger impact you have  and that's about doing things that people might not think are possible. And I've been amazed  the more I learn about technology  the more I realize I don't know  and that's because this technological horizon  the thing that you can see to do next  the more you learn about technology  the more you learn what's possible. You learn that the balloons are possible because there's some material that will work for them. CR  What's interesting about  you too  though  for me  is that  we have lots of people who are thinking about the future  and they are going and looking and they're coming back  but we never see the implementation. I think of somebody you knew and read about  Tesla. The principle of that for you is what  LP  Well  I think invention is not enough. If you invent something  Tesla invented electric power that we use  but he struggled to get it out to people. That had to be done by other people. It took a long time. And I think if we can actually combine both things  where we have an innovation and invention focus  plus the ability to really    a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people in a way that's positive for the world and to give people hope. You know  I'm amazed with the Loon Project just how excited people were about that  because it gave them hope for the two thirds of the world that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good. CR  Which is a second thing about corporations. You are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well. LP  Yeah. I'm really dismayed most people think companies are basically evil. They get a bad rap. And I think that's somewhat correct. Companies are doing the same incremental thing that they did    years ago or    years ago. That's not really what we need. We need  especially in technology  we need revolutionary change  not incremental change. CR  You once said  actually  as I think I've got this about right  that you might consider  rather than giving your money  if you were leaving it to some cause  just simply giving it to Elon Musk  because you had confidence that he would change the future  and that you would therefore   LP  Yeah  if you want to go Mars  he wants to go to Mars  to back up humanity  that's a worthy goal  but it's a company  and it's philanthropical. So I think we aim to do kind of similar things. And I think  you ask  we have a lot of employees at Google who have become pretty wealthy. People make a lot of money in technology. A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world. You want to make it better. Why isn't the company that you work for worthy not just of your time but your money as well  I mean  but we don't have a concept of that. That's not how we think about companies  and I think it's sad  because companies are most of our effort. They're where most of people's time is  where a lot of the money is  and so I think I'd like for us to help out more than we are. CR  When I close conversations with lots of people  I always ask this question  What state of mind  what quality of mind is it that has served you best  People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity  and other people in the media have said that. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus. What quality of mind  as I leave this audience  has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present  LP  You know  I think the most important thing    I looked at lots of companies and why I thought they don't succeed over time. We've had a more rapid turnover of companies. And I said  what did they fundamentally do wrong  What did those companies all do wrong  And usually it's just that they missed the future. And so I think  for me  I just try to focus on that and say  what is that future really going to be and how do we create it  and how do we cause our organization  to really focus on that and drive that at a really high rate  And so that's been curiosity  it's been looking at things people might not think about  working on things that no one else is working on  because that's where the additionality really is  and be willing to do that  to take that risk. Look at Android. I felt guilty about working on Android when it was starting. It was a little startup we bought. It wasn't really what we were really working on. And I felt guilty about spending time on that. That was stupid. That was the future  right  That was a good thing to be working on. CR  It is great to see you here. It's great to hear from you  and a pleasure to sit at this table with you. Thanks  Larry. LP  Thank you. CR  Larry Page. In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies  fathers are usually known by their sons  but I'm one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter  and I am proud of it. Malala started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in       and when her efforts were honored in       and she was given the national youth peace prize  and she became a very famous  very popular young girl of her country. Before that  she was my daughter  but now I am her father. Ladies and gentlemen  if we glance to human history  the story of women is the story of injustice  inequality  violence and exploitation. You see  in patriarchal societies  right from the very beginning  when a girl is born  her birth is not celebrated. She is not welcomed  neither by father nor by mother. The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother  and nobody congratulates the father. And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child. When she gives birth to the first girl child  first daughter  she is sad. When she gives birth to the second daughter  she is shocked  and in the expectation of a son  when she gives birth to a third daughter  she feels guilty like a criminal. Not only the mother suffers  but the daughter  the newly born daughter  when she grows old  she suffers too. At the age of five  while she should be going to school  she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school. Until the age of     somehow  she has a good life. She can have fun. She can play with her friends in the streets  and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly. But when she enters her teens  when she becomes    years old  she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort. She is confined under the four walls of her home. She is no more a free individual. She becomes the so called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family  and if she transgresses the code of that so called honor  she could even be killed. And it is also interesting that this so called code of honor  it does not only affect the life of a girl  it also affects the life of the male members of the family. I know a family of seven sisters and one brother  and that one brother  he has migrated to the Gulf countries  to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents  because he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood. So this brother  he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so called honor. And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience. A good girl is supposed to be very quiet  very humble and very submissive. It is the criteria. The role model good girl should be very quiet. She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders  even if she does not like them. If she is married to a man she doesn't like or if she is married to an old man  she has to accept  because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient. If she is married very early  she has to accept. Otherwise  she will be called disobedient. And what happens at the end  In the words of a poetess  she is wedded  bedded  and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters. And it is the irony of the situation that this mother  she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sons. And this vicious cycle goes on  goes on. Ladies and gentlemen  this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently  if women and men think differently  if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries  if they can break a few norms of family and society  if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states  which go against the basic human rights of the women. Dear brothers and sisters  when Malala was born  and for the first time  believe me  I don't like newborn children  to be honest  but when I went and I looked into her eyes  believe me  I got extremely honored. And long before she was born  I thought about her name  and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan. Her name was Malalai of Maiwand  and I named my daughter after her. A few days after Malala was born  my daughter was born  my cousin came    and it was a coincidence    he came to my home and he brought a family tree  a family tree of the Yousafzai family  and when I looked at the family tree  it traced back to     years of our ancestors. But when I looked  all were men  and I picked my pen  drew a line from my name  and wrote   Malala.  And when she grow old  when she was four and a half years old  I admitted her in my school. You will be asking  then  why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school  Yes  I must mention it. It may be taken for granted in Canada  in America  in many developed countries  but in poor countries  in patriarchal societies  in tribal societies  it's a big event for the life of girl. Enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name. Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life. I have five sisters  and none of them could go to school  and you will be astonished  two weeks before  when I was filling out the Canadian visa form  and I was filling out the family part of the form  I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters. And the reason was that I have never  never seen the names of my sisters written on any document. That was the reason that I valued my daughter. What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daughters  I thought I must change it. I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter. I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come. I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings. And all these good values  I tried to inculcate in her personality. And this was not only she  only Malala. I imparted all these good values to my school  girl students  and boy students as well. I used education for emancipation. I taught my girls  I taught my girl students  to unlearn the lesson of obedience. I taught my boy students to unlearn the lesson of so called pseudo honor. Dear brothers and sisters  we were striving for more rights for women  and we were struggling to have more  more and more space for the women in society. But we came across a new phenomenon. It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women's rights. It was called Talibanization. It means a complete negation of women's participation in all political  economical and social activities. Hundreds of schools were lost. Girls were prohibited from going to school. Women were forced to wear veils and they were stopped from going to the markets. Musicians were silenced  girls were flogged and singers were killed. Millions were suffering  but few spoke  and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog  and you speak for your rights. It's really the most scary thing. At the age of     Malala stood  and she stood for the right of education. She wrote a diary for the BBC blog  she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries  and she spoke from every platform she could. And her voice was the most powerful voice. It spread like a crescendo all around the world. And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign  and on October         she was shot in the head at point blank range. It was a doomsday for my family and for me. The world turned into a big black hole. While my daughter was on the verge of life and death  I whispered into the ears of my wife   Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter   And she abruptly told me   Please don't blame yourself. You stood for the right cause. You put your life at stake for the cause of truth  for the cause of peace  and for the cause of education  and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you. You both were on the right path and God will protect her.  These few words meant a lot to me  and I didn't ask this question again. When Malala was in the hospital  and she was going through the severe pains and she had had severe headaches because her facial nerve was cut down  I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife. But my daughter never complained. She used to tell us   I'm fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face. I'll be okay. Please don't worry.  She was a solace for us  and she consoled us. Dear brothers and sisters  we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times  and I'm glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women  she is like any    year old girl. She cries when her homework is incomplete. She quarrels with her brothers  and I am very happy for that. People ask me  what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised  I tell them  don't ask me what I did. Ask me what I did not do. I did not clip her wings  and that's all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Good morning. When I was a little boy  I had an experience that changed my life  and is in fact why I'm here today. That one moment profoundly affected how I think about art  design and engineering. As background  I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family of loving and talented artists in one of the world's great cities. My dad  John Ferren  who died when I was     was an artist by both passion and profession  as is my mom  Rae. He was one of the New York School abstract expressionists who  together with his contemporaries  invented American modern art  and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist towards modernism in the   th century. Isn't it remarkable that  after thousands of years of people doing mostly representational art  that modern art  comparatively speaking  is about    minutes old  yet now pervasive. As with many other important innovations  those radical ideas required no new technology  just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment  plus resiliency in the face of near universal criticism and rejection. In our home  art was everywhere. It was like oxygen  around us and necessary for life. As I watched him paint  Dad taught me that art was not about being decorative  but was a different way of communicating ideas  and in fact one that could bridge the worlds of knowledge and insight. Given this rich artistic environment  you'd assume that I would have been compelled to go into the family business  but no. I followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy. I had no interest in becoming an artist  certainly not a painter. What I did love was electronics and machines    taking them apart  building new ones  and making them work. Fortunately  my family also had engineers in it  and with my parents  these were my first role models. What they all had in common was they worked very  very hard. My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn. On weekends  we would go together to Cortlandt Street  which was New York City's radio row. There we would explore massive piles of surplus electronics  and for a few bucks bring home treasures like Norden bombsights and parts from the first IBM tube based computers. I found these objects both useful and fascinating. I learned about engineering and how things worked  not at school but by taking apart and studying these fabulously complex devices. I did this for hours every day  apparently avoiding electrocution. Life was good. However  every summer  sadly  the machines got left behind while my parents and I traveled overseas to experience history  art and design. We visited the great museums and historic buildings of both Europe and the Middle East  but to encourage my growing interest in science and technology  they would simply drop me off in places like the London Science Museum  where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself studying the history of science and technology. Then  when I was about nine years old  we went to Rome. On one particularly hot summer day  we visited a drum shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting. My dad said it was called the Pantheon  a temple for all of the gods. It didn't look all that special from the outside  as I said  but when we walked inside  I was immediately struck by three things  First of all  it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside. It was very dark  the only source of light being an big open hole in the roof. Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole  but it was called the oculus  an eye to the heavens. And there was something about this place  I didn't know why  that just felt special. As we walked to the center of the room  I looked up at the heavens through the oculus. This was the first church that I'd been to that provided an unrestricted view between God and man. But I wondered  what about when it rained  Dad may have called this an oculus  but it was  in fact  a big hole in the roof. I looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor. As I became more accustomed to the dark  I was able to make out details of the floor and the surrounding walls. No big deal here  just the same statuary stuff that we'd seen all over Rome. In fact  it looked like the Appian Way marble salesman showed up with his sample book  showed it to Hadrian  and Hadrian said   We'll take all of it.  But the ceiling was amazing. It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome. I'd seen these before  and Bucky was friends with my dad. It was modern  high tech  impressive  a huge     foot clear span which  not coincidentally  was exactly its height. I loved this place. It was really beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before  so I asked my dad   When was this built   He said   About       years ago.  And I said   No  I mean  the roof.  You see  I assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some long past war. He said   It's the original roof.  That moment changed my life  and I can remember it as if it were yesterday. For the first time  I realized people were smart       years ago.  Laughter  This had never crossed my mind. I mean  to me  the pyramids at Giza  we visited those the year before  and sure they're impressive  nice enough design  but look  give me an unlimited budget         to        laborers  and about    to    years to cut and drag stone blocks  across the countryside  and I'll build you pyramids too. But no amount of brute force gets you the dome of the Pantheon  not       years ago  nor today. And incidentally  it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built. To build the Pantheon took some miracles. By miracles  I mean things that are technically barely possible  very high risk  and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time  certainly not by you. For example  here are some of the Pantheon's miracles. To make it even structurally possible  they had to invent super strong concrete  and to control weight  varied the density of the aggregate as they worked their way up the dome. For strength and lightness  the dome structure used five rings of coffers  each of diminishing size  which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design. It was wonderfully cool inside because of its huge thermal mass  natural convection of air rising up through the oculus  and a Venturi effect when wind blows across the top of the building. I discovered for the first time that light itself has substance. The shaft of light beaming through the oculus was both beautiful and palpable  and I realized for the first time that light could be designed. Further  that of all of the forms of design  visual design  they were all kind of irrelevant without it  because without light  you can't see any of them. I also realized that I wasn't the first person to think that this place was really special. It survived gravity  barbarians  looters  developers and the ravages of time to become what I believe is the longest continuously occupied building in history. Largely because of that visit  I came to understand that  contrary to what I was being told in school  the worlds of art and design were not  in fact  incompatible with science and engineering. I realized  when combined  you could create things that were amazing that couldn't be done in either domain alone. But in school  with few exceptions  they were treated as separate worlds  and they still are. My teachers told me that I had to get serious and focus on one or the other. However  urging me to specialize only caused me to really  appreciate those polymaths like Michelangelo  Leonardo da Vinci  Benjamin Franklin  people who did exactly the opposite. And this led me to embrace and want to be in both worlds. So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the Pantheon actually happen  Someone themselves  perhaps Hadrian  needed a brilliant creative vision. They also needed the storytelling and leadership skills necessary to fund and execute it  and a mastery of science and technology with the ability and knowhow to push existing innovations even farther. It is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least five miracles. The problem is  no matter how talented  rich or smart you are  you only get one to one and a half miracles. That's it. That's the quota. Then you run out of time  money  enthusiasm  whatever. Remember  most people can't even imagine one of these technical miracles  and you need at least five to make a Pantheon. In my experience  these rare visionaries who can think across the worlds of art  design and engineering have the ability to notice when others have provided enough of the miracles to bring the goal within reach. Driven by the clarity of their vision  they summon the courage and determination to deliver the remaining miracles and they often take what other people think to be insurmountable obstacles and turn them into features. Take the oculus of the Pantheon. By insisting that it be in the design  it meant you couldn't use much of the structural technology that had been developed for Roman arches. However  by instead embracing it and rethinking weight and stress distribution  they came up with a design that only works if there's a big hole in the roof. That done  you now get the aesthetic and design benefits of light  cooling and that critical direct connection with the heavens. Not bad. These people not only believed that the impossible can be done  but that it must be done. Enough ancient history. What are some recent examples of innovations that combine creative design and technological advances in a way so profound that they will be remembered a thousand years from now  Well  putting a man on the moon was a good one  and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either. Talk about one giant leap  It's hard to imagine a more profound moment in human history than when we first left our world to set foot on another. So what came after the moon  One is tempted to say that today's pantheon is the Internet  but I actually think that's quite wrong  or at least it's only part of the story. The Internet isn't a Pantheon. It's more like the invention of concrete  important  absolutely necessary to build the Pantheon  and enduring  but entirely insufficient by itself. However  just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the Pantheon  new designers will use the technologies of the Internet to create novel concepts that will endure. The smartphone is a perfect example. Soon the majority of people on the planet will have one  and the idea of connecting everyone to both knowledge and each other will endure. So what's next  What imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon  Thinking about this  I rejected many very plausible and dramatic breakthroughs to come  such as curing cancer. Why  Because Pantheons are anchored in designed physical objects  ones that inspire by simply seeing and experiencing them  and will continue to do so indefinitely. It is a different kind of language  like art. These other vital contributions that extend life and relieve suffering are  of course  critical  and fantastic  but they're part of the continuum of our overall knowledge and technology  like the Internet. So what is next  Perhaps counterintuitively  I'm guessing it's a visionary idea from the late     s that's been revived every decade since  autonomous vehicles. Now you're thinking  give me a break. How can a fancy version of cruise control be profound  Look  much of our world has been designed around  roads and transportation. These were as essential to the success of the Roman Empire as the interstate highway system to the prosperity and development of the United States. Today  these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for     years. Although perhaps not obvious today  autonomous vehicles will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and  by extension  civilization. Here's why  Once they become ubiquitous  each year  these vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone and a million globally. Automotive energy consumption and air pollution will be cut dramatically. Much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear. They will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities  work  and the way we live. We will get where we're going faster and society will recapture vast amounts of lost productivity now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting. But why now  Why do we think this is ready  Because over the last    years  people from outside the automotive industry have spent countless billions creating the needed miracles  but for entirely different purposes. It took folks like DARPA  universities  and companies completely outside of the automotive industry to notice that if you were clever about it  autonomy could be done now. So what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles  One  you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is. This was solved neatly by the GPS system  Global Positioning System  that the U.S. Government put in place. You need to know where all the roads are  what the rules are  and where you're going. The various needs of personal navigation systems  in car navigation systems  and web based maps address this. You must have near continuous communication with high performance computing networks and with others nearby to understand their intent. The wireless technologies developed for mobile devices  with some minor modifications  are completely suitable to solve this. You'll probably want some restricted roadways to get started that both society and its lawyers agree are safe to use for this. This will start with the HOV lanes and move from there. But finally  you need to recognize people  signs and objects. Machine vision  special sensors  and high performance computing can do a lot of this  but it turns out a lot is not good enough when your family is on board. Occasionally  humans will  need to do sense making. For this  you might actually have to wake up your passenger and ask them what the hell that big lump is in the middle of the road. Not so bad  and it will give us a sense of purpose in this new world. Besides  once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant  and it's okay to keep driving  every other car on the surface of the Earth will know that from that point on. Five miracles  mostly delivered  and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful  and new functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home. The beginning is now only a handful of years away  and I predict that autonomous vehicles will permanently change our world over the next several decades. In conclusion  I've come to believe that the ingredients for the next Pantheons are all around us  just waiting for visionary people with the broad knowledge  multidisciplinary skills  and intense passion to harness them to make their dreams a reality. But these people don't spontaneously pop into existence. They need to be nurtured and encouraged from when they're little kids. We need to love them and help them discover their passions. We need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success  as is perseverance. We need to help them to find their own role models  and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible  and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus  and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums  we need to encourage them to find their own path  even if it's very different from our own. But a cautionary note  We also need to periodically pry them away from their modern miracles  the computers  phones  tablets  game machines and TVs  take them out into the sunlight so they can experience both the natural and design wonders of our world  our planet and our civilization. If we don't  they won't understand what these precious things are that someday they will be resopnsible for protecting and improving. We also need them to understand something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated in our increasingly tech dependent world  that art and design are not luxuries  nor somehow incompatible with science and engineering. They are in fact essential to what makes us special. Someday  if you get the chance  perhaps you can take your kids to the actual Pantheon  as we will our daughter Kira  to experience firsthand the power of that astonishing design  which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome  reached       years into the future to set the course for my life. Thank you. A herd of wildebeests  a shoal of fish  a flock of birds. Many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectacles in the natural world. But why do these groups form  The common answers include things like seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs or gathering to mate or breed  and all of these explanations  while often true  make a huge assumption about animal behavior  that the animals are in control of their own actions  that they are in charge of their bodies. And that is often not the case. This is Artemia  a brine shrimp. You probably know it better as a sea monkey. It's small  and it typically lives alone  but it can gather in these large red swarms that span for meters  and these form because of a parasite. These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm. A tapeworm is effectively a long  living gut with genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other. As a freelance journalist  I sympathize. The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body  but it also does other things. It castrates them  it changes their color from transparent to bright red  it makes them live longer  and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found  it makes them swim in groups. Why  Because the tapeworm  like many other parasites  has a complicated life cycle involving many different hosts. The shrimp are just one step on its journey. Its ultimate destination is this  the greater flamingo. Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce  so to get there  it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour  and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm. They aren't sociable through their own volition  but because they are being controlled. It's not safety in numbers. It's actually the exact opposite. The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies  turning them into vehicles for getting itself into a flamingo. And here is another example of a parasitic manipulation. This is a suicidal cricket. This cricket swallowed the  larvae of a Gordian worm  or horsehair worm. The worm grew to adult size within it  but it needs to get into water in order to mate  and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket's brain  causing it to behave erratically. When the cricket nears a body of water  such as this swimming pool  it jumps in and drowns  and the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse. Crickets are really roomy. Who knew  The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone. They are part of an entire cavalcade of mind controlling parasites  of fungi  viruses  and worms and insects and more that all specialize in subverting and overriding the wills of their hosts. Now  I first learned about this way of life through David Attenborough's  Trials of Life  about    years ago  and then later through a wonderful book called  Parasite Rex  by my friend Carl Zimmer. And I've been writing about these creatures ever since. Few topics in biology enthrall me more. It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain. Because after all  they are always compelling and they are delightfully macabre. When you write about parasites  your lexicon swells with phrases like  devoured alive  and  bursts out of its body.  But there's more to it than that. I'm a writer  and fellow writers in the audience will know that we love stories. Parasites invite us to resist the allure of obvious stories. Their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations. Why  for example  does this caterpillar start violently thrashing about when another insect gets close to it and those white cocoons that it seems to be standing guard over  Is it maybe protecting its siblings  No. This caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it. The eggs hatched and the young wasps devoured the caterpillar alive before bursting out of its body. See what I mean  Now  the caterpillar didn't die. Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons. This caterpillar is a head banging  zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it. We have a lot to get through.  I only have    minutes.  Laughter  Now  some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world  that they are outliers  and that point of view is understandable  because by their nature  parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things. They're easy to overlook  but that doesn't mean that they aren't important. A few years back  a man called Kevin Lafferty took a group of scientists into three Californian estuaries and they pretty much weighed and dissected and recorded everything they could find  and what they found were parasites in extreme abundance. Especially common were trematodes  tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts like this unfortunate snail. Now  a single trematode is tiny  microscopic  but collectively they weighed as much as all the fish in the estuaries and three to nine times more than all the birds. And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you  the cricket thing  One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato found that in one stream  these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some    percent of the diet of local trout. Manipulation is not an oddity. It is a critical and common part of the world around us  and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators  and more excitingly  they're starting to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts. And this is one of my favorite examples. This is Ampulex compressa  the emerald cockroach wasp  and it is a truth universally acknowledged that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession of some fertilized eggs must be in want of a cockroach. When she finds one  she stabs it with a stinger that is also a sense organ. This discovery came out three weeks ago. She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ equipped with small sensory bumps that allow her to feel the distinctive texture of a roach's brain. So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag  she finds the brain  and she injects it with venom into two very specific clusters of neurons. Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon. It doesn't kill the roach  nor does it sedate it. The roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to  but it doesn't choose to  because the venom nixes its motivation to walk  and only that. The wasp basically un checks the escape from danger box in the roach's operating system  allowing her to lead her helpless victim back to her lair by its antennae like a person walking a dog. And once there  she lays an egg on it  egg hatches  devoured alive  bursts out of body  yadda yadda yadda  you know the drill. Now I would argue that  once stung  the cockroach isn't a roach anymore. It's more of an extension of the wasp  just like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm. These hosts won't get to survive or reproduce. They have as much control over their own fates as my car. Once the parasites get in  the hosts don't get a say. Now humans  of course  are no stranger to manipulation. We take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains and to change our moods  and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas if not an attempt to influence someone else's mind  But our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine grained specificity of the parasites. Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp. Now  I think this is part of what makes parasites so sinister and so compelling. We place such a premium on our free will and our independence that the prospect of losing those qualities to forces unseen informs many of our deepest societal fears. Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals and mind controlling supervillains    these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction  but in nature  they happen all the time. Which leads me to an obvious and disquieting question  Are there dark  sinister parasites that are influencing our behavior without us knowing about it  besides the NSA  If there are any   I've got a red dot on my forehead now  don't I  If there are any  this is a good candidate for them. This is Toxoplasma gondii  or Toxo  for short  because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname. Toxo infects mammals  a wide variety of mammals  but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat. And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse  it turns the rodent into a cat seeking missile. If the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss  it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of away. The cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex. It's a classic tale of Eat  Prey  Love. You're very charitable  generous people. Hi  Elizabeth  I loved your talk. How does the parasite control its host in this way  We don't really know. We know that Toxo releases an enzyme that makes dopamine  a substance involved in reward and motivation. We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain  including those involved in sexual arousal. But how those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear. What is clear is that this thing is a single cell. This has no nervous system. It has no consciousness. It doesn't even have a body. But it's manipulating a mammal  We are mammals. We are more intelligent than a mere rat  to be sure  but our brains have the same basic structure  the same types of cells  the same chemicals running through them  and the same parasites. Estimates vary a lot  but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have Toxo in their brains. Now typically  this doesn't lead to any overt illness. The parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long period of time. But there's some evidence that those people who are carriers score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people  that they have a slightly  higher risk of car accidents  and there's some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected. Now  I think this evidence is still inconclusive  and even among Toxo researchers  opinion is divided as to whether the parasite is truly influencing our behavior. But given the widespread nature of such manipulations  it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren't similarly affected. And I think that this capacity to constantly subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing. They're constantly inviting us to look at the natural world sideways  and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing  whether they're simple and obvious or baffling and puzzling  are not the results of individuals acting through their own accord but because they are being bent to the control of something else. And while that idea may be disquieting  and while parasites' habits may be very grisly  I think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin. At the end of  On the Origin of Species   Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life  and of endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful  and I like to think he could easily have been talking about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks. But perhaps  that's just a parasite talking. Thank you. My job at Twitter is to ensure user trust  protect user rights and keep users safe  both from each other and  at times  from themselves. Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter. Back in January       we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform. January       more than     million. We were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes. That's a        percent increase. Now  the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. There's no risk involved. My job is to root out and prevent activity that might. Sounds straightforward  right  You might even think it'd be easy  given that I just said the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. Why spend so much time searching for potential calamities in innocuous activities  Given the scale that Twitter is at  a one in a million chance happens     times a day. It's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale. For us  edge cases  those rare situations that are unlikely to occur  are more like norms. Say   .    percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone. There's no threat involved. Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like Australia's Heart Reef  or tweeting about a concert they're attending  or sharing pictures of cute baby animals. After you take out that   .    percent  that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly         per month. The sheer scale of what we're dealing with makes for a challenge. You know what else makes my role particularly challenging  People do weird things. And I have to figure out what they're doing  why  and whether or not there's risk involved  often without much in terms of context or background. I'm going to show you some examples that I've run into during my time at Twitter    these are all real examples   of situations that at first seemed cut and dried  but the truth of the matter was something altogether different. The details have been changed to protect the innocent and sometimes the guilty. We'll start off easy.   Yo bitch   If you saw a Tweet that only said this  you might think to yourself   That looks like abuse.  After all  why would you want to receive the message   Yo  bitch.  Now  I try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes  so I knew that  yo  bitch  was also often a common greeting between friends  as well as being a popular  Breaking Bad  reference. I will admit that I did not expect to encounter a fourth use case. It turns out it is also used on Twitter when people are role playing as dogs. And in fact  in that case  it's not only not abusive  it's technically just an accurate greeting. So okay  determining whether or not something is abusive without context  definitely hard. Let's look at spam. Here's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior  sending the exact same message to thousands of people. While this is a mockup I put together using my account  we see accounts doing this all the time. Seems pretty straightforward. We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior. Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule. Turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead because you wanted to go outside and see if you could see it. You're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it's spam. Okay. Let's make the stakes higher. Back to my account  again exhibiting classic behavior. This time it's sending the same message and link. This is often indicative of  something called phishing  somebody trying to steal another person's account information by directing them to another website. That's pretty clearly not a good thing. We want to  and do  suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior. So why are the stakes higher for this  Well  this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video of a police officer beating a non violent protester who's trying to let the world know what's happening. We don't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it. That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors  and even then  we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate. Now  given the sorts of challenges I'm up against  it's crucial that I not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected. And that's not just an issue for me  or for Twitter  it's an issue for you. It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things. So what do I do  I pause and I think  how could all of this go horribly wrong  I visualize catastrophe. And that's hard. There's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that  like when you're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement. But you still have to do it  particularly if you're marrying      million tweets per day. What do I mean by  visualize catastrophe   I try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death  and what to do to prevent that. Which happens to be my next example. This is my cat  Eli. We wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their tweets. A picture is worth a thousand words. You only get     characters. You add a photo to your tweet  look at how much more content you've got now. There's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet. My job isn't to think of those. It's to think of what could go wrong. How could this picture lead to my death  Well  here's one possibility. There's more in that picture than just a cat. There's geodata. When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera  there's a lot of additional information saved along in that image. In fact  this image also contains the equivalent of this  more specifically  this. Sure  it's not likely that someone's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture I took of my cat  but I start by assuming the worst will happen. That's why  when we launched photos on Twitter  we made the decision to strip that geodata out. If I start by assuming the worst and work backwards  I can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases. Given that I spend my days and nights imagining the worst that could happen  it wouldn't be surprising if  my worldview was gloomy. It's not. The vast majority of interactions I see    and I see a lot  believe me    are positive  people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other. It's just that for those of us dealing with scale  for those of us tasked with keeping people safe  we have to assume the worst will happen  because for us  a one in a million chance is pretty good odds. Thank you. Looking deeply inside nature  through the magnifying glass of science  designers extract principles  processes and materials that are forming the very basis of design methodology. From synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials  to computational methods that emulate neural processes  nature is driving design. Design is also driving nature. In realms of genetics  regenerative medicine and synthetic biology  designers are growing novel technologies  not foreseen or anticipated by nature. Bionics explores the interplay between biology and design. As you can see  my legs are bionic. Today  I will tell human stories of bionic integration  how electromechanics attached to the body  and implanted inside the body are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability  between human limitation and human potential. Bionics has defined my physicality. In       both of my legs were amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite  incurred during a mountain climbing accident. At that time  I didn't view my body as broken. I reasoned that a human being can never be  broken.  Technology is broken. Technology is inadequate. This simple but powerful idea was a call to arms  to advance technology for the elimination of my own disability  and ultimately  the disability of others. I began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return to the vertical world of rock and ice climbing. I quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is malleable  able to take on any form  any function    a blank slate for which to create  perhaps  structures that could extend beyond biological capability. I made my height adjustable. I could be as short as five feet or as tall as I'd like. So when I was feeling bad about myself  insecure  I would jack my height up. But when I was feeling confident and suave  I would knock my height down a notch  just to give the competition a chance. Narrow edged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures  where the human foot cannot penetrate  and spiked feet enabled me to climb vertical ice walls  without ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue. Through technological innovation  I returned to my sport  stronger and better. Technology had eliminated my disability  and allowed me a new climbing prowess. As a young man  I imagined a future world where technology so advanced could rid the world of disability  a world in which neural implants would allow the visually impaired to see. A world in which the paralyzed could walk  via body exoskeletons. Sadly  because of deficiencies in technology  disability is rampant in the world. This gentleman is missing three limbs. As a testimony to current technology  he is out of the wheelchair  but we need to do a better job in bionics  to allow  one day  full rehabilitation for a person with this level of injury. At the MIT Media Lab  we've established the Center for Extreme Bionics. The mission of the center is to put forth fundamental science and technological capability that will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans  across a broad range of brain and body disabilities. Today  I'm going to tell you how my legs function  how they work  as a case in point for this center. Now  I made sure to shave my legs last night  because I knew I'd be showing them off. Bionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces. There's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs  mechanical  how my limbs are attached to my biological body  dynamic  how they move like flesh and bone  and electrical  how they communicate with my nervous system. I'll begin with mechanical interface. In the area of design  we still do not understand how to attach devices to the body mechanically. It's extraordinary to me that in this day and age  one of the most mature  oldest technologies in the human timeline  the shoe  still gives us blisters. How can this be  We have no idea how to attach things to our bodies. This is the beautifully lyrical design work of Professor Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab  showing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances  shown here by color variation in this  D printed model. Imagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it  when you need it  for optimal support and flexibility  without ever causing discomfort. My bionic limbs are attached to my biological body via synthetic skins with stiffness variations  that mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics. To achieve that mirroring  we first developed a mathematical model of my biological limb. To that end  we used imaging tools such as MRI  to look inside my body  to figure out the geometries and locations of various tissues. We also took robotic tools    here's a    actuator circle that goes around the biological limb. The actuators come in  find the surface of the limb  measure its unloaded shape  and then they push on the tissues to measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point. We combine these imaging and robotic data to build a mathematical description of my biological limb  shown on the left. You see a bunch of points  or nodes  At each node  there's a color that represents tissue compliance. We then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin  shown on the right. And we've discovered optimality is  where the body is stiff  the synthetic skin should be soft  where the body is soft  the synthetic skin is stiff  and this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances. With this framework  we've produced bionic limbs that are the most comfortable limbs I've ever worn. Clearly  in the future  our clothing  our shoes  our braces  our prostheses  will no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies  but rather  data driven quantitative frameworks. In that future  our shoes will no longer give us blisters. We're also embedding sensing and smart materials into the synthetic skins. This is a material developed by SRI International  California. Under electrostatic effect  it changes stiffness. So under zero voltage  the material is compliant  it's floppy like paper. Then the button's pushed  a voltage is applied  and it becomes stiff as a board. We embed this material into the synthetic skin that attaches my bionic limb to my biological body. When I walk here  it's no voltage. My interface is soft and compliant. The button's pushed  voltage is applied  and it stiffens  offering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb. We're also building exoskeletons. This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas of the running cycle  to protect the biological joints from high impacts and degradation. In the future  we'll all be wearing exoskeletons in common activities  such as running. Next  dynamic interface. How do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone  At my MIT lab  we study how humans with normal physiologies stand  walk and run. What are the muscles doing  and how are they controlled by the spinal cord  This basic science motivates what we build. We're building bionic ankles  knees and hips. We're building body parts from the ground up. The bionic limbs that I'm wearing are called BiOMs. They've been fitted to nearly       patients      of which have been wounded U.S. soldiers. How does it work  At heel strike  under computer control  the system controls stiffness  to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground. Then at mid stance  the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers to lift the person into the walking stride  comparable to how muscles work in the calf region. This bionic propulsion is very important clinically to patients. So on the left  you see the bionic device worn by a lady  on the right  a passive device worn by the same lady  that fails to emulate normal muscle function  enabling her to do something everyone should be able to do  go up and down their steps at home. Bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats. Here's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway. This is Steve Martin    not the comedian    who lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan. We're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles  that wrap around the biological limb. This gentleman does not have any leg condition  any disability. He has a normal physiology  so these exoskeletons are applying muscle like torques and powers  so that his own muscles need not apply those torques and powers. This is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking. It significantly reduces metabolic cost. It's so profound in its augmentation  that when a normal  healthy person wears the device for    minutes and then takes it off  their own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward. We're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and faster and more efficient. Moving on to electrical interface  How do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system  Across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles. That's communicated to the bionic limb  so when I think about moving my phantom limb  the robot tracks those movement desires. This diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled. So we model the missing biological limb  and we've discovered what reflexes occurred  how the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles. And that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb. What we've done  then  is we modulate the sensitivity of the reflex  the modeled spinal reflex  with the neural signal  so when I relax my muscles in my residual limb  I get very little torque and power  but the more I fire my muscles  the more torque I get  and I can even run. And that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command. Feels great. We want to go a step further. We want to actually close the loop between the human and the bionic external limb. We're doing experiments where we're growing nerves  transected nerves  through channels  or micro channel arrays. On the other side of the channel  the nerve then attaches to cells  skin cells and muscle cells. In the motor channels  we can sense how the person wishes to move. That can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb  then  sensory information  on the bionic limb can be converted to stimulations in adjacent channels  sensory channels. So when this is fully developed and for human use  persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone  but actually feel like flesh and bone. This video shows Lisa Mallette  shortly after being fitted with two bionic limbs. Indeed  bionics is making a profound difference in people's lives. LM  Oh my God  I can't believe it  LM  It's just like I've got a real leg  Woman  Now  don't start running. Man  Now turn around  and do the same thing walking up  but get on your heel to toe  like you would normally just walk on level ground. Try to walk right up the hill. LM  Oh my God. Man  Is it pushing you up  LM  Yes  I'm not even    I can't even describe it. Man  It's pushing you right up. Hugh Herr  Next week  I'm visiting the Center    Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next week I'm visiting the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services  and I'm going to try to convince CMS to grant appropriate code language and pricing  so this technology can be made available to the patients that need it. Thank you. It's not well appreciated  but over half of the world's population suffers from some form of cognitive  emotional  sensory or motor condition  and because of poor technology  too often  conditions result in disability and a poorer quality of life. Basic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights. Every person should have the right to live life without disability if they so choose    the right to live life without severe depression  the right to see a loved one  in the case of seeing impaired  or the right to walk or to dance  in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation. As a society  we can achieve these human rights  if we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled. A person can never be broken. Our built environment  our technologies  are broken and disabled. We the people need not accept our limitations  but can transcend disability through technological innovation. Indeed  through fundamental advances in bionics in this century  we will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience  and we will end disability. I'd like to finish up with one more story  a beautiful story. The story of Adrianne Haslet Davis. Adrianne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack. I met Adrianne when this photo was taken  at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Adrianne is a dancer  a ballroom dancer. Adrianne breathes and lives dance. It is her expression. It is her art form. Naturally  when she lost her limb in the Boston terrorist attack  she wanted to return to the dance floor. After meeting her and driving home in my car  I thought  I'm an MIT professor. I have resources. Let's build her a bionic limb  to enable her to go back to her life of dance. I brought in MIT scientists with expertise in prosthetics  robotics  machine learning and biomechanics  and over a     day research period  we studied dance. We brought in dancers with biological limbs  and we studied how they move  what forces they apply on the dance floor  and we took those data  and we put forth fundamental principles of dance  reflexive dance capability  and we embedded that intelligence into the bionic limb. Bionics is not only about making people stronger and faster. Our expression  our humanity can be embedded into electromechanics. It was  .  seconds between the bomb blasts in the Boston terrorist attack. In  .  seconds  the criminals and cowards took Adrianne off the dance floor. In     days  we put her back. We will not be intimidated  brought down  diminished  conquered or stopped by acts of violence. Ladies and gentlemen  please allow me to introduce Adrianne Haslet Davis  her first performance since the attack. She's dancing with Christian Lightner. Ladies and gentlemen  members of the research team  Elliott Rouse and Nathan Villagaray Carski. Elliott and Nathan. The world makes you something that you're not  but you know inside what you are  and that question burns in your heart  How will you become that  I may be somewhat unique in this  but I am not alone  not alone at all. So when I became a fashion model  I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream that I'd always wanted since I was a young child. My outside self finally matched my inner truth  my inner self. For complicated reasons which I'll get to later  when I look at this picture  at that time I felt like  Geena  you've done it  you've made it  you have arrived. But this past October  I realized that I'm only just beginning. All of us are put in boxes by our family  by our religion  by our society  our moment in history  even our own bodies. Some people have the courage to break free  not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin or by the beliefs of those that surround them. Those people are always the threat to the status quo  to what is considered acceptable. In my case  for the last nine years  some of my neighbors  some of my friends  colleagues  even my agent  did not know about my history. I think  in mystery  this is called the reveal. Here is mine. I was assigned boy at birth based on the appearance of my genitalia. I remember when I was five years old in the Philippines walking around our house  I would always wear this t shirt on my head. And my mom asked me   How come you always wear that t shirt on your head   I said   Mom  this is my hair. I'm a girl.  I knew then how to self identify. Gender has always been considered a fact  immutable  but we now know it's actually more fluid  complex and mysterious. Because of my success  I never had the courage to share my story  not because I thought what I am is wrong  but because of how the world treats those of us who wish to break free. Every day  I am so grateful because I am a woman. I have a mom and dad and family who accepted me for who I am. Many are not so fortunate. There's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender. There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion. There is a Hindu goddess  hijra goddess. So when I was eight years old  I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating these mysteries. I was in front of the stage  and I remember  out comes this beautiful woman right in front of me  and I remember that moment something hit me  That is the kind of woman I would like to be. So when I was    years old  still dressing as a boy  I met this woman named T.L. She is a transgender beauty pageant manager. That night she asked me   How come you are not joining the beauty pageant   She convinced me that if I joined that she would take care of the registration fee and the garments  and that night  I won best in swimsuit and best in long gown and placed second runner up among    plus candidates. That moment changed my life. All of a sudden  I was introduced to the world of beauty pageants. Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a pageant queen for transgender women  but I'll take it. So from    to    years old  I joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it's at the back of the truck  literally  or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field  and when it rains    it rains a lot in the Philippines    the organizers would have to move it inside someone's house. I also experienced the goodness of strangers  especially when we would travel in remote provinces in the Philippines. But most importantly  I met some of my best friends in that community. In       my mom  who had moved to San Francisco  called me and told me that my green card petition came through  that I could now move to the United States. I resisted it. I told my mom   Mom  I'm having fun. I'm here with my friends  I love traveling  being a beauty pageant queen.  But then two weeks later she called me  she said   Did you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gender marker   That was all I needed to hear. My mom also told me to put two E's in the spelling of my name. She also came with me when I had my surgery in Thailand at    years old. It's interesting  in some of the most rural cities in Thailand  they perform some of the most prestigious  safe and sophisticated surgery. At that time in the United States  you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender marker. So in       I moved to San Francisco  and I remember looking at my California driver's license with the name Geena and gender marker F. That was a powerful moment. For some people  their I.D. is their license to drive or even to get a drink  but for me  that was my license to live  to feel dignified. All of a sudden  my fears were minimized. I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York and be a model. Many are not so fortunate. I think of this woman named Islan Nettles. She's from New York  she's a young woman who was courageously living her truth  but hatred ended her life. For most of my community  this is the reality in which we live. Our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general population. Every November     we have a global vigil for Transgender Day of Remembrance. I'm here at this stage because it's a long history of people who fought and stood up for injustice. This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. Today  this very moment  is my real coming out. I could no longer live my truth for and by myself. I want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror. I am here  exposed  so that one day there will never be a need for a November    vigil. My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am. Will you  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Kathryn Schulz  Geena  one quick question for you. I'm wondering what you would say  especially to parents  but in a more broad way  to friends  to family  to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that's being assigned them  what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them  Geena Rocero  Sure. Well  first  really  I'm so blessed. The support system  with my mom especially  and my family  that in itself is just so powerful. I remember every time I would coach young trans women  I would mentor them  and sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can't accept it  I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom   Mom  can you call this woman   And sometimes it works  sometimes it doesn't  so   But it's just  gender identity is in the core of our being  right  I mean  we're all assigned gender at birth  so what I'm trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match  and there should be a space that would allow people to self identify  and that's a conversation that we should have with parents  with colleagues. The transgender movement  it's at the very beginning  to compare to how the gay movement started. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done. There should be an understanding. There should be a space of curiosity and asking questions  and I hope all of you guys will be my allies. KS  Thank you. That was so lovely. GR  Thank you. Daffodil Hudson  Hello  Yeah  this is she.

Brought to you by TED staff and friends   If you look deep into the night sky  you see stars  and if you look further  you see more stars  and further  galaxies  and  further  more galaxies. But if you keep looking further and further  eventually you see nothing for a long while  and then finally you see a faint  fading afterglow  and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang. Now  the Big Bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small  incredibly hot  incredibly roiling mass  and from it sprung everything we see. Now  we've mapped that afterglow with great precision  and when I say we  I mean people who aren't me. We've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision  and one of the shocks about it is that it's almost completely uniform. Fourteen billion light years that way and    billion light years that way  it's the same temperature. Now it's been    billion years since that Big Bang  and so it's got faint and cold. It's now  .  degrees. But it's not exactly  .  degrees. It's only  .  degrees to about    parts in a million. Over here  it's a little hotter  and over there  it's a little cooler  and that's incredibly important to everyone in this room  because where it was a little hotter  there was a little more stuff  and where there was a little more stuff  we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies and superclusters and all the structure you see in the cosmos. And those small  little  inhomogeneities     parts in a million  those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cosmos. That is spectacular  and that's not what they found on Monday  what they found on Monday is cooler. So here's what they found on Monday  Imagine you take a bell  and you whack the bell with a hammer. What happens  It rings. But if you wait  that ringing fades and fades and fades until you don't notice it anymore. Now  that early universe was incredibly dense  like a metal  way denser  and if you hit it  it would ring  but the thing ringing would be the structure of space time itself  and the hammer would be quantum mechanics. What they found on Monday was evidence of the ringing of the space time of the early universe  what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era  and here's how they found it. Those waves have long since faded. If you go for a walk  you don't wiggle. Those gravitational waves in the structure of space are totally invisible for all practical purposes. But early on  when the universe was making that last afterglow  the gravitational waves put little twists in the structure of the light that we see. So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper    in fact  these guys spent three years on the South Pole looking straight up through the coldest  clearest  cleanest air they possibly could find looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol  the signal  of gravitational waves  the ringing of the early universe. And on Monday  they announced that they had found it. And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing  though that is awesome. The thing that's totally amazing  the reason I'm on this stage  is because what that tells us is something deep about the early universe. It tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble    and this is the idea of inflation  one large bubble surrounded by something else. This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation  but anything that isn't inflation that explains this will look the same. This is a theory  an idea  that has been around for a while  and we never thought we we'd really see it. For good reasons  we thought we'd never see killer evidence  and this is killer evidence. But the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger  roiling pot of universal stuff. We're never going to see the stuff outside  but by going to the South Pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky  we can figure out that we're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that. And that amazes me. Thanks a lot. Chris Anderson  So  this is an interview with a difference. On the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words  what I did was  I asked Bill and Melinda to dig out from their archive some images that would help explain some of what they've done  and do a few things that way. So  we're going to start here. Melinda  when and where was this  and who is that handsome man next to you  Melinda Gates  With those big glasses  huh  This is in Africa  our very first trip  the first time either of us had ever been to Africa  in the fall of     . We were already engaged to be married. We married a few months later  and this was the trip where we really went to see the animals and to see the savanna. It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time off from work. But what really touched us  actually  were the people  and the extreme poverty. We started asking ourselves questions. Does it have to be like this  And at the end of the trip  we went out to Zanzibar  and took some time to walk on the beach  which is something we had done a lot while we were dating. And we'd already been talking about during that time that the wealth that had come from Microsoft would be given back to society  but it was really on that beach walk that we started to talk about  well  what might we do and how might we go about it  CA  So  given that this vacation led to the creation of the world's biggest private foundation  it's pretty expensive as vacations go.  Laughter  MG  I guess so. We enjoyed it. CA  Which of you was the key instigator here  or was it symmetrical  Bill Gates  Well  I think we were excited that there'd be a phase of our life where we'd get to work together and figure out how to give this money back. At this stage  we were talking about the poorest  and could you have a big impact on them  Were there things that weren't being done  There was a lot we didn't know. Our na vet  is pretty incredible  when we look back on it. But we had a certain enthusiasm that that would be the phase  the post Microsoft phase would be our philanthropy. MG  Which Bill always thought was going to come after he was     so he hasn't quite hit    yet  so some things change along the way. CA  So it started there  but it got accelerated. So that was '    and it was '    really  before the foundation itself started. MA  Yeah  in '    we read an article about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world  and we kept saying to ourselves   Well that can't be. In the U.S.  you just go down to the drug store.  And so we started gathering scientists and started learning about population  learning about vaccines  learning about what had worked and what had failed  and that's really when we got going  was in late           . CA  So  you've got a big pot of money and a world full of so many different issues. How on Earth do you decide what to focus on  BG  Well  we decided that we'd pick two causes  whatever the biggest inequity was globally  and there we looked at children dying  children not having enough nutrition to ever develop  and countries that were really stuck  because with that level of death  and parents would have so many kids that they'd get huge population growth  and that the kids were so sick that they really couldn't be educated and lift themselves up. So that was our global thing  and then in the U.S.  both of us have had amazing educations  and we saw that as the way that the U.S. could live up to its promise of equal opportunity is by having a phenomenal education system  and the more we learned  the more we realized we're not really fulfilling that promise. And so we picked those two things  and everything the foundation does is focused there. CA  So  I asked each of you to pick an image that you like that illustrates your work  and Melinda  this is what you picked. What's this about  MG  So I  one of the things I love to do when I travel is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women  whether it's Bangladesh  India  lots of countries in Africa  and I go in as a Western woman without a name. I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis. And I kept hearing from women  over and over and over  the more I traveled   I want to be able to use this shot.  I would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines  and they would bring the conversation around to  But what about the shot I get   which is an injection they were getting called Depo Provera  which is a contraceptive. And I would come back and talk to global health experts  and they'd say   Oh no  contraceptives are stocked in in the developing world.  Well  you had to dig deeper into the reports  and this is what the team came to me with  which is  to have the number one thing that women tell you in Africa they want to use stocked out more than     days a year explains why women were saying to me   I walked    kilometers without my husband knowing it  and I got to the clinic  and there was nothing there.  And so condoms were stocked in in Africa because of all the AIDS work that the U.S. and others supported. But women will tell you over and over again   I can't negotiate a condom with my husband. I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS  and I need that tool because then I can space the births of my children  and I can feed them and have a chance of educating them.  CA  Melinda  you're Roman Catholic  and you've often been embroiled in controversy over this issue  and on the abortion question  on both sides  really. How do you navigate that  MG  Yeah  so I think that's a really important point  which is  we had backed away from contraceptives as a global community. We knew that     million women were saying they wanted access to contraceptives  even the contraceptives we have here in the United States  and we weren't providing them because of the political controversy in our country  and to me that was just a crime  and I kept looking around trying to find the person that would get this back on the global stage  and I finally realized I just had to do it. And even though I'm Catholic  I believe in contraceptives just like most of the Catholic women in the United States who report using contraceptives  and I shouldn't let that controversy be the thing that holds us back. We used to have consensus in the United States around contraceptives  and so we got back to that global consensus  and actually raised  .  billion dollars around exactly this issue for women. CA  Bill  this is your graph. What's this about  BG  Well  my graph has numbers on it. I really like this graph. This is the number of children who die before the age of five every year. And what you find is really a phenomenal success story which is not widely known  that we are making incredible progress. We go from    million not long after I was born to now we're down to about six million. So this is a story largely of vaccines. Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year. That was eradicated  so that got down to zero. Measles was killing a couple million a year. That's down to a few hundred thousand. Anyway  this is a chart where you want to get that number to continue  and it's going to be possible  using the science of new vaccines  getting the vaccines out to kids. We can actually accelerate the progress. The last decade  that number has dropped faster than ever in history  and so I just love the fact that you can say  okay  if we can invent new vaccines  we can get them out there  use the very latest understanding of these things  and get the delivery right  that we can perform a miracle. CA  I mean  you do the math on this  and it works out  I think  literally to thousands of kids' lives saved every day compared to the prior year. It's not reported. An airliner with     plus deaths is a far  far bigger story than that. Does that drive you crazy  BG  Yeah  because it's a silent thing going on. It's a kid  one kid at a time. Ninety eight percent of this has nothing to do with natural disasters  and yet  people's charity  when they see a natural disaster  are wonderful. It's incredible how people think  okay  that could be me  and the money flows. These causes have been a bit invisible. Now that the Millennium Development Goals and various things are getting out there  we are seeing some increased generosity  so the goal is to get this well below a million  which should be possible in our lifetime. CA  Maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big  sad face to get engaged. I mean  you've used it in your letter this year  you used basically this argument to say that aid  contrary to the current meme that aid is kind of worthless and broken  that actually it has been effective. BG  Yeah  well people can take  there is some aid that was well meaning and didn't go well. There's some venture capital investments that were well meaning and didn't go well. You shouldn't just say  okay  because of that  because we don't have a perfect record  this is a bad endeavor. You should look at  what was your goal  How are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy so these countries can take care of themselves  and say wow  this is going well  and be smarter. We can spend aid smarter. It is not all a panacea. We can do better than venture capital  I think  including big hits like this. CA  Traditional wisdom is that it's pretty hard for married couples to work together. How have you guys managed it  MG  Yeah  I've had a lot of women say to me   I really don't think I could work with my husband. That just wouldn't work out.  You know  we enjoy it  and we don't    this foundation has been a coming to for both of us in its continuous learning journey  and we don't travel together as much for the foundation  actually  as we used to when Bill was working at Microsoft. We have more trips where we're traveling separately  but I always know when I come home  Bill's going to be interested in what I learned  whether it's about women or girls or something new about the vaccine delivery chain  or this person that is a great leader. He's going to listen and be really interested. And he knows when he comes home  even if it's to talk about the speech he did or the data or what he's learned  I'm really interested  and I think we have a really collaborative relationship. But we don't every minute together  that's for sure. CA  But now you are  and we're very happy that you are. Melinda  early on  you were basically largely running the show. Six years ago  I guess  Bill came on full time  so moved from Microsoft and became full time. That must have been hard  adjusting to that. No  MG  Yeah. I think actually  for the foundation employees  there was way more angst for them than there was for me about Bill coming. I was actually really excited. I mean  Bill made this decision even obviously before it got announced in       and it was really his decision  but again  it was a beach vacation where we were walking on the beach and he was starting to think of this idea. And for me  the excitement of Bill putting his brain and his heart against these huge global problems  these inequities  to me that was exciting. Yes  the foundation employees had angst about that. CA  That's cool. MG  But that went away within three months  once he was there. BG  Including some of the employees. MG  That's what I said  the employees  it went away for them three months after you were there. BG  No  I'm kidding. MG  Oh  you mean  the employees didn't go away. BG  A few of them did  but   CA  So what do you guys argue about  Sunday     o'clock  you're away from work  what comes up  What's the argument  BG  Because we built this thing together from the beginning  it's this great partnership. I had that with Paul Allen in the early days of Microsoft. I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger  and now Melinda  and in even stronger  equal ways  is the partner  so we talk a lot about which things should we give more to  which groups are working well  She's got a lot of insight. She'll sit down with the employees a lot. We'll take the different trips she described. So there's a lot of collaboration. I can't think of anything where one of us had a super strong opinion about one thing or another  CA  How about you  Melinda   though  Can you   Laughter  You never know. MG  Well  here's the thing. We come at things from different angles  and I actually think that's really good. So Bill can look at the big data and say   I want to act based on these global statistics.  For me  I come at it from intuition. I meet with lots of people on the ground and Bill's taught me to take that and read up to the global data and see if they match  and I think what I've taught him is to take that data and meet with people on the ground to understand  can you actually deliver that vaccine  Can you get a woman to accept those polio drops in her child's mouth  Because the delivery piece is every bit as important as the science. So I think it's been more a coming to over time towards each other's point of view  and quite frankly  the work is better because of it. CA  So  in vaccines and polio and so forth  you've had some amazing successes. What about failure  though  Can you talk about a failure and maybe what you've learned from it  BG  Yeah. Fortunately  we can afford a few failures  because we've certainly had them. We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work that you know you're going to have different failures. Like  we put out  one that got a lot of publicity was asking for a better condom. Well  we got hundreds of ideas. Maybe a few of those will work out. We were very na ve  certainly I was  about a drug for a disease in India  visceral leishmaniasis  that I thought  once I got this drug  we can just go wipe out the disease. Well  turns out it took an injection every day for    days. It took three more years to get it than we expected  and then there was no way it was going to get out there. Fortunately  we found out that if you go kill the sand flies  you probably can have success there  but we spent five years  you could say wasted five years  and about    million  on a path that turned out to have very modest benefit when we got there. CA  You're spending  like  a billion dollars a year in education  I think  something like that. Is anything  the story of what's gone right there is quite a long and complex one. Are there any failures that you can talk about  MG  Well  I would say a huge lesson for us out of the early work is we thought that these small schools were the answer  and small schools definitely help. They bring down the dropout rate. They have less violence and crime in those schools. But the thing that we learned from that work  and what turned out to be the fundamental key  is a great teacher in front of the classroom. If you don't have an effective teacher in the front of the classroom  I don't care how big or small the building is  you're not going to change the trajectory of whether that student will be ready for college. CA  So Melinda  this is you and your eldest daughter  Jenn. And just taken about three weeks ago  I think  three or four weeks ago. Where was this  MG  So we went to Tanzania. Jenn's been to Tanzania. All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit  actually. And we did something very different  which is  we decided to go spend two nights and three days with a family. Anna and Sanare are the parents. They invited us to come and stay in their boma. Actually  the goats had been there  I think  living in that particular little hut on their little compound before we got there. And we stayed with their family  and we really  really learned what life is like in rural Tanzania. And the difference between just going and visiting for half a day or three quarters of a day versus staying overnight was profound  and so let me just give you one explanation of that. They had six children  and as I talked to Anna in the kitchen  we cooked for about five hours in the cooking hut that day  and as I talked to her  she had absolutely planned and spaced with her husband the births of their children. It was a very loving relationship. This was a Maasai warrior and his wife  but they had decided to get married  they clearly had respect and love in the relationship. Their children  their six children  the two in the middle were twins      a boy  and a girl named Grace. And when we'd go out to chop wood and do all the things that Grace and her mother would do  Grace was not a child  she was an adolescent  but she wasn't an adult. She was very  very shy. So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn. We kept trying to engage her  but she was shy. And at night  though  when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania  and there was no moon that night  the first night  and no stars  and Jenn came out of our hut with her REI little headlamp on  Grace went immediately  and got the translator  came straight up to my Jenn and said   When you go home  can I have your headlamp so I can study at night   CA  Oh  wow. MG  And her dad had told me how afraid he was that unlike the son  who had passed his secondary exams  because of her chores  she'd not done so well and wasn't in the government school yet. He said   I don't know how I'm going to pay for her education. I can't pay for private school  and she may end up on this farm like my wife.  So they know the difference that an education can make in a huge  profound way. CA  I mean  this is another pic of your other two kids  Rory and Phoebe  along with Paul Farmer. Bringing up three children when you're the world's richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art. How have you managed it  What's been your approach  BG  Well  I'd say overall the kids get a great education  but you've got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they're going to go and do  and our philosophy has been to be very clear with them    most of the money's going to the foundation    and help them find something they're excited about. We want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing. And so far  they're fairly diligent  excited to pick their own direction. CA  You've obviously guarded their  privacy carefully for obvious reasons. I'm curious why you've given me permission to show this picture now here at TED. MG  Well  it's interesting. As they get older  they so know that our family belief is about responsibility  that we are in an unbelievable situation just to live in the United States and have a great education  and we have a responsibility to give back to the world. And so as they get older and we are teaching them    they have been to so many countries around the world   they're saying  we do want people to know that we believe in what you're doing  Mom and Dad  and it is okay to show us more. So we have their permission to show this picture  and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it eventually in some of his work. But they really care deeply about the mission of the foundation  too. CA  You've easily got enough money despite your vast contributions to the foundation to make them all billionaires. Is that your plan for them  BG  Nope. No. They won't have anything like that. They need to have a sense that their own work is meaningful and important. We read an article long  actually  before we got married  where Warren Buffett talked about that  and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor either to society or to the kids. CA  Well  speaking of Warren Buffett  something really amazing happened in       when somehow your only real rival for richest person in America suddenly turned around and agreed to give    percent of his fortune to your foundation. How on Earth did that happen  I guess there's a long version and a short version of that. We've got time for the short version. BG  All right. Well  Warren was a close friend  and he was going to have his wife Suzie give it all away. Tragically  she passed away before he did  and he's big on delegation  and    Laughter    he said   CA  Tweet that. BG  If he's got somebody who is doing something well  and is willing to do it at no charge  maybe that's okay. But we were stunned. MG  Totally stunned. BG  We had never expected it  and it has been unbelievable. It's allowed us to increase our ambition in what the foundation can do quite dramatically. Half the resources we have come from Warren's mind blowing generosity. CA  And I think you've pledged that by the time you're done  more than  or    percent of your wealth  will be given to the foundation. BG  Yes. CA  And since this relationship  it's amazing  And recently  you and Warren have been going around trying to persuade other billionaires and successful people to pledge to give  what  more than half of their assets for philanthropy. How is that going  BG  Well  we've got about     people who have now taken this giving pledge. The thing that's great is that we get together yearly and talk about  okay  do you hire staff  what do you give to them  We're not trying to homogenize it. I mean  the beauty of philanthropy is this mind blowing diversity. People give to some things. We look and go   Wow.  But that's great. That's the role of philanthropy is to pick different approaches  including even in one space  like education. We need more experimentation. But it's been wonderful  meeting those people  sharing their journey to philanthropy  how they involve their kids  where they're doing it differently  and it's been way more successful than we expected. Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size in the years ahead. MG  And having people see that other people are making change with philanthropy  I mean  these are people who have created their own businesses  put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas. If they put their ideas and their brain behind philanthropy  they can change the world. And they start to see others doing it  and saying   Wow  I want to do that with my own money.  To me  that's the piece that's incredible. CA  It seems to me  it's actually really hard for some people to figure out even how to remotely spend that much money on something else. There are probably some billionaires in the room and certainly some successful people. I'm curious  can you make the pitch  What's the pitch  BG  Well  it's the most fulfilling thing we've ever done  and you can't take it with you  and if it's not good for your kids  let's get together and brainstorm about what we can be done. The world is a far better place because of the philanthropists of the past  and the U.S. tradition here  which is the strongest  is the envy of the world. And part of the reason I'm so optimistic is because I do think philanthropy is going to grow and take some of these things government's not just good at working on and discovering and shine some light in the right direction. CA  The world's got this terrible inequality  growing inequality problem that seems structural. It does seem to me that if more of your peers took the approach that you two have made  it would make a dent both in that problem and certainly in the perception of that problem. Is that a fair comment  BG  Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy and give to the least wealthy  it's good. It tries to balance out  and that's just. MG  But you change systems. In the U.S.  we're trying to change the education system so it's just for everybody and it works for all students. That  to me  really changes the inequality balance. BG  That's the most important. CA  Well  I really think that most people here and many millions around the world are just in awe of the trajectory your lives have taken and the spectacular degree to which you have shaped the future. Thank you so much for coming to TED and for sharing with us and for all you do. BG  Thank you. MG  Thank you. BG  Thank you. MG  Thank you very much. BG  All right  good job.  Applause  If you remember that first decade of the web  it was really a static place. You could go online  you could look at pages  and they were put up either by organizations who had teams to do it or by individuals who were really tech savvy for the time. And with the rise of social media and social networks in the early     s  the web was completely changed to a place where now the vast majority of content we interact with is put up by average users  either in YouTube videos or blog posts or product reviews or social media postings. And it's also become a much more interactive place  where people are interacting with others  they're commenting  they're sharing  they're not just reading. So Facebook is not the only place you can do this  but it's the biggest  and it serves to illustrate the numbers. Facebook has  .  billion users per month. So half the Earth's Internet population is using Facebook. They are a site  along with others  that has allowed people to create an online persona with very little technical skill  and people responded by putting huge amounts of personal data online. So the result is that we have behavioral  preference  demographic data for hundreds of millions of people  which is unprecedented in history. And as a computer scientist   what this means is that I've been able to build models that can predict all sorts of hidden attributes for all of you that you don't even know you're sharing information about. As scientists  we use that to help the way people interact online  but there's less altruistic applications  and there's a problem in that users don't really understand these techniques and how they work  and even if they did  they don't have a lot of control over it. So what I want to talk to you about today is some of these things that we're able to do  and then give us some ideas of how we might go forward to move some control back into the hands of users. So this is Target  the company. I didn't just put that logo on this poor  pregnant woman's belly. You may have seen this anecdote that was printed in Forbes magazine where Target sent a flyer to this    year old girl with advertisements and coupons for baby bottles and diapers and cribs two weeks before she told her parents that she was pregnant. Yeah  the dad was really upset. He said   How did Target figure out that this high school girl was pregnant before she told her parents   It turns out that they have the purchase history for hundreds of thousands of customers and they compute what they  call a pregnancy score  which is not just whether or  not a woman's pregnant  but what her due date is. And they compute that not by looking at the obvious things  like  she's buying a crib or baby clothes  but things like  she bought more vitamins than she normally had  or she bought a handbag that's big enough to hold diapers. And by themselves  those purchases don't seem like they might reveal a lot  but it's a pattern of behavior that  when you take it in the context  of thousands of other people  starts to actually reveal some insights. So that's the kind of thing that we do when we're predicting stuff about you on social media. We're looking for little patterns of behavior that  when you detect them among millions of people  lets us find out all kinds of things. So in my lab and with colleagues  we've developed mechanisms where we can quite accurately predict things like your political preference  your personality score  gender  sexual orientation  religion  age  intelligence  along with things like how much you trust the people you know and how strong those relationships are. We can do all of this really well. And again  it doesn't come from what you might think of as obvious information. So my favorite example is from this study that was published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academies. If you Google this  you'll find it. It's four pages  easy to read. And they looked at just people's Facebook likes  so just the things you like on Facebook  and used that to predict all these attributes  along with some other ones. And in their paper they listed the five likes that were most indicative of high intelligence. And among those was liking a page for curly fries.  Laughter  Curly fries are delicious  but liking them does not necessarily mean that you're smarter than the average person. So how is it that one of the strongest indicators of your intelligence is liking this page when the content is totally irrelevant to the attribute that's being predicted  And it turns out that we have to look at a whole bunch of underlying theories to see why we're able to do this. One of them is a sociological theory called homophily  which basically says people are friends with people like them. So if you're smart  you tend to be friends with smart people  and if you're young  you tend to be friends with young people  and this is well established for hundreds of years. We also know a lot about how information spreads through networks. It turns out things like viral videos or Facebook likes or other information spreads in exactly the same way that diseases spread through social networks. So this is something we've studied for a long time. We have good models of it. And so you can put those things together and start seeing why things like this happen. So if I were to give you a hypothesis  it would be that a smart guy started this page  or maybe one of the first people who liked it would have scored high on that test. And they liked it  and their friends saw it  and by homophily  we know that he probably had smart friends  and so it spread to them   and some of them liked it  and they had smart friends  and so it spread to them  and so it propagated through the network to a host of smart people  so that by the end  the action of liking the curly fries page is indicative of high intelligence  not because of the content  but because the actual action of liking reflects back the common attributes of other people who have done it. So this is pretty complicated stuff  right  It's a hard thing to sit down and explain to an average user  and even if you do  what can the average user do about it  How do you know that  you've liked something that indicates a trait for you that's totally irrelevant to the content of what you've liked  There's a lot of power that users don't have to control how this data is used. And I see that as a real  problem going forward. So I think there's a couple paths that we want to look at if we want to give users some control over how this data is used  because it's not always going to be used for their benefit. An example I often give is that  if I ever get bored being a professor  I'm going to go start a company that predicts all of these attributes and things like how well you work in teams and if you're a drug user  if you're an alcoholic. We know how to predict all that. And I'm going to sell reports to H.R. companies and big businesses that want to hire you. We totally can do that now. I could start that business tomorrow  and you would have absolutely no control over me using your data like that. That seems to me to be a problem. So one of the paths we can go down is the policy and law path. And in some respects  I think that that would be most effective  but the problem is we'd actually have to do it. Observing our political process in action makes me think it's highly unlikely that we're going to get a bunch of representatives to sit down  learn about this  and then enact sweeping changes to intellectual property law in the U.S. so users control their data. We could go the policy route  where social media companies say  you know what  You own your data. You have total control over how it's used. The problem is that the revenue models for most social media companies rely on sharing or exploiting  users' data in some way. It's sometimes said of Facebook that the users aren't the customer  they're the product. And so how do you get a company to cede control of their main asset back to the users  It's possible  but I don't think it's something that we're going to see change quickly. So I think the other path that we can go down that's going to be more effective is one of more science. It's doing science that allowed us to develop all these mechanisms for computing this personal data in the first place. And it's actually very similar research that we'd have to do if we want to develop mechanisms that can say to a user   Here's the risk of that action you just took.  By liking that Facebook page  or by sharing this piece of personal information  you've now improved my ability to predict whether or not you're using drugs or whether or not you get along well in the workplace. And that  I think  can affect whether or not people want to share something  keep it private  or just keep it offline altogether. We can also look at things like allowing people to encrypt data that they upload  so it's kind of invisible and worthless to sites like Facebook or third party services that access it  but that select users who the person who posted it want to see it have access to see it. This is all super exciting research from an intellectual perspective  and so scientists are going to be willing to do it. So that gives us an advantage over the law side. One of the problems that people bring up when I talk about this is  they say  you know  if people start keeping all this data private  all those methods that you've been developing to predict their traits are going to fail. And I say  absolutely  and for me  that's success  because as a scientist  my goal is not to infer information about users  it's to improve the way people interact online. And sometimes that involves inferring things about them  but if users don't want me to use that data  I think they should have the right to do that. I want users to be informed and consenting users of the tools that we develop. And so I think encouraging this kind of science and supporting researchers who want to cede some of that control back to users and away from the social media companies means that going forward  as these tools evolve and advance  means that we're going to have an educated and empowered user base  and I think all of us can agree that that's a pretty ideal way to go forward. Thank you. So a chip  a poet and a boy. It's just about    years ago  June       when Intel announced that there was a flaw at the core of their Pentium chip. Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm to calculate intermediate quotients necessary for iterative floating points of divisions    I don't know what that means  but  it's what it says on Wikipedia   there was a flaw and an error that meant that there was a certain probability that the result of the calculation would be an error  and the probability was one out of every     billion calculations. So Intel said your average spreadsheet would be flawed once every        years. They didn't think it was significant  but there was an outrage in the community. The community  the techies  said  this flaw has to be addressed. They were not going to stand by quietly as Intel gave them these chips. So there was a revolution across the world. People marched to demand    okay  not really exactly like that   but they rose up and they demanded that Intel fix the flaw. And Intel set aside     million dollars to fund the replacement of millions of chips to fix the flaw. So billions of dollars in our society was spent to address a problem which would come once out of every     billion calculations. Number two  a poet. This is Martin Niem ller. You're familiar with his poetry. Around the height of the Nazi period  he started repeating the verse   First they came for the communists  and I did nothing  did not speak out because I was not a communist. Then they came for the socialists. Then they came for the trade unions. Then they came for the Jews. And then they came for me. But there was no one left to speak for me.  Now  Niem ller is offering a certain kind of insight. This is an insight at the core of intelligence. We could call it cluefulness. It's a certain kind of test  Can you recognize an underlying threat and respond  Can you save yourself or save your kind  Turns out ants are pretty good at this. Cows  not so much. So can you see the pattern  Can you see a pattern and then recognize and do something about it  Number two. Number three  a boy. This is my friend Aaron Swartz. He's Tim's friend. He's friends of many of you in this audience  and seven years ago  Aaron came to me with a question. It was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk. I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk   Laws that choke creativity.  And Aaron looked at me and was a little impatient  and he said   So how are you ever going to solve the problems you're talking about  Copyright policy  Internet policy  how are you ever going to address those problems so long as there's this fundamental corruption in the way our government works   So I was a little put off by this. He wasn't sharing in my celebration. And I said to him   You know  Aaron  it's not my field  not my field.  He said   You mean as an academic  it's not your field   I said   Yeah  as an academic  it's not my field.  He said   What about as a citizen  As a citizen.  Now  this is the way Aaron was. He didn't tell. He asked questions. But his questions spoke as clearly as my four year old's hug. He was saying to me   You've got to get a clue. You have got to get a clue  because there is a flaw at the core of the operating system of this democracy  and it's not a flaw every one out of     billion times our democracy tries to make a decision. It is every time  every single important issue. We've got to end the bovinity of this political society. We've got to adopt  it turns out  the word is fourmi formatic attitude    that's what the Internet tells me the word is    the ant's appreciative attitude that gets us to recognize this flaw  save our kind and save our demos. Now if you know Aaron Swartz  you know that we lost him just over a year ago. It was about six weeks before I gave my TED Talk  and I was so grateful to Chris that he asked me to give this TED Talk  not because I had the chance to talk to you  although that was great  but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression. I couldn't begin to describe the sadness. Because I had to focus. I had to focus on  what was I going to say to you  It saved me. But after the buzz  the excitement  the power that comes from this community  I began to yearn for a less sterile  less academic way to address these issues  the issues that I was talking about. We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire as a target for this political movement  because the primary in New Hampshire is so incredibly important. It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion that was beginning to talk about  how would we make this issue of this corruption central in       But it was another soul that caught my imagination  a woman named Doris Haddock  aka Granny D. On January             years ago  at the age of     Granny D started a walk. She started in Los Angeles and began to walk to Washington  D.C. with a single sign on her chest that said   campaign finance reform.  Eighteen months later  at the age of     she arrived in Washington with hundreds following her  including many congressmen who had gotten in a car and driven out about a mile outside of the city to walk in with her. Now  I don't have    months to walk across the country. I've got three kids who hate to walk  and a wife who  it turns out  still hates when I'm not there for mysterious reasons  so this was not an option  but the question I asked  could we remix Granny D a bit  What about a walk not of       miles but of     miles across New Hampshire in January  So on January     the anniversary of Aaron's death  we began a walk that ended on January   th  the day that Granny D was born. A total of     people joined us across this walk  as we went from the very top to the very bottom of New Hampshire talking about this issue. And what was astonishing to me  something I completely did not expect to find  was the passion and anger that there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue. We had found in a poll that    percent of Americans believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics. Now politicians and pundits tell you  there's nothing we can do about this issue  Americans don't care about it  but the reason for that is that    percent of Americans think there's nothing that can be done about this issue. And it's this gap between    and    that explains our politics of resignation. I mean  after all  at least    percent of us wish we could fly like Superman  but because at least    percent of us believe we can't  we don't leap off of tall buildings every time we have that urge. That's because we accept our limits  and so too with this reform. But when you give people the sense of hope  you begin to thaw that absolute sense of impossibility. As Harvey Milk said  if you give 'em hope  you give 'em a chance  a way to think about how this change is possible. Hope. And hope is the one thing that we  Aaron's friends  failed him with  because we let him lose that sense of hope. I loved that boy like I love my son. But we failed him. And I love my country  and I'm not going to fail that. I'm not going to fail that. That sense of hope  we're going to hold  and we're going to fight for  however impossible this battle looks. What's next  Well  we started with this march with     people  and next year  there will be       on different routes that march in the month of January and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause  and then in       before the primary  there will be        who march across that state  meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause. And as we have marched  people around the country have begun to say   Can we do the same thing in our state   So we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers  that is  Granny D walkers  and Granny D walkers across the country will be marching for this reform. Number one. Number two  on this march  one of the founders of Thunderclap  David Cascino  was with us  and he said   Well what can we do   And so they developed a platform  which we are announcing today  that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform. Regardless of where you are  in New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire  you can sign up and directly be informed where the candidates are on this issue so you can decide who to vote for as a function of which is going to make this possibility real. And then finally number three  the hardest. We're in the age of the Super PAC. Indeed yesterday  Merriam announced that Merriam Webster will have Super PAC as a word. It is now an official word in the dictionary. So on May    aka May Day  we're going to try an experiment. We're going to try a launching of what we can think of as a Super PAC to end all Super PACs. And the basic way this works is this. For the last year  we have been working with analysts and political experts to calculate  how much would it cost to win enough votes in the United States Congress to make fundamental reform possible  What is that number  Half a billion  A billion  What is that number  And then whatever that number is  we are going to kickstart  sort of  because you can't use KickStarter for political work  but anyway  kickstart  sort of  first a bottom up campaign where people will make small dollar commitments contingent on reaching very ambitious goals  and when those goals have been reached  we will turn to the large dollar contributors  to get them to contribute to make it possible for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary to win this issue  to change the way money influences politics  so that on November    which I discovered yesterday is the day that Aaron would have been    years old  on November    we will celebrate     representatives in the House and    Senators in the United States Senate who have committed to this idea of fundamental reform. So last night  we heard about wishes. Here's my wish. May one. May the ideals of one boy unite one nation behind one critical idea that we are one people  we are the people who were promised a government  a government that was promised to be dependent upon the people alone  the people  who  as Madison told us  meant not the rich more than the poor. May one. And then may you  may you join this movement  not because you're a politician  not because you're an expert  not because this is your field  but because if you are  you are a citizen. Aaron asked me that. Now I've asked you. Thank you very much. When people think about cities  they tend to think of certain things. They think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers  noisy cabs. But when I think about cities  I think about people. Cities are fundamentally about people  and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work. So even more important than buildings in a city are the public spaces in between them. And today  some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces. So I believe that lively  enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city. They are what makes it come alive. But what makes a public space work  What attracts people to successful public spaces  and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away  I thought  if I could answer those questions  I could make a huge contribution to my city. But one of the more wonky things about me is that I am an animal behaviorist  and I use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces. One of the first spaces that I studied was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park in midtown Manhattan. This little space became a small phenomenon  and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers  it made an enormous impression on me. I studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather  so I knew that places like Paley Park didn't happen by accident. I saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail. But what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it  Well  I would sit in the park and watch very carefully  and first among other things were the comfortable  movable chairs. People would come in  find their own seat  move it a bit  actually  and then stay a while  and then interestingly  people themselves attracted other people  and ironically  I felt more peaceful if there were other people around. And it was green. This little park provided what New Yorkers crave  comfort and greenery. But my question was  why weren't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn't feel alone  or like a trespasser  Unfortunately  that's not how cities were being designed. So here you see a familiar sight. This is how plazas have been designed for generations. They have that stylish  Spartan look that we often associate with modern architecture  but it's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this. They not only look desolate  they feel downright dangerous. I mean  where would you sit here  What would you do here  But architects love them. They are plinths for their creations. They might tolerate a sculpture or two  but that's about it. And for developers  they are ideal. There's nothing to water  nothing to maintain  and no undesirable people to worry about. But don't you think this is a waste  For me  becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that I lived in and loved. I wanted to be able to create places that would give you the feeling that you got in Paley Park  and not allow developers to build bleak plazas like this. But over the many years  I have learned how hard it is to create successful  meaningful  enjoyable public spaces. As I learned from my stepfather  they certainly do not happen by accident  especially in a city like New York  where public space has to be fought for to begin with  and then for them to be successful  somebody has to think very hard about every detail. Now  open spaces in cities are opportunities. Yes  they are opportunities for commercial investment  but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city  and those two goals are often not aligned with one another  and therein lies the conflict. The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early     s  when I was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River. And this sandy wasteland had lain barren for    years  and we were told  unless we found a developer in six months  it would go bankrupt. So we came up with a radical  almost insane idea. Instead of building a park as a complement to future development  why don't we reverse that equation and build a small but very high quality public open space first  and see if that made a difference. So we only could afford to build a two block section of what would become a mile long esplanade  so whatever we built had to be perfect. So just to make sure  I insisted that we build a mock up in wood  at scale  of the railing and the sea wall. And when I sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me  the railing hit exactly at eye level  blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water's edge. So you see  details really do make a difference. But design is not just how something looks  it's how your body feels on that seat in that space  and I believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience. In this photo  everything looks very finished  but that granite edge  those lights  the back on that bench  the trees in planting  and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be. Now  this proved very valuable    years later when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of New York. And he said to me on that very day  he said that New York was projected to grow from eight to nine million people. And he asked me   So where are you going to put one million additional New Yorkers   Well  I didn't have any idea. Now  you know that New York does place a high value on attracting immigrants  so we were excited about the prospect of growth  but honestly  where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water  How were we going to find housing for that many new New Yorkers  And if we couldn't spread out  which was probably a good thing  where could new housing go  And what about cars  Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars. So what were we going to do  If we couldn't spread out  we had to go up. And if we had to go up  we had to go up in places where you wouldn't need to own a car. So that meant using one of our greatest assets  our transit system. But we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it. So here was the answer to our puzzle. If we were to channel and redirect all new development around transit  we could actually handle that population increase  we thought. And so here was the plan  what we really needed to do  We needed to redo our zoning    and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool    and basically reshape the entire city  targeting where new development could go and prohibiting any development at all in our car oriented  suburban style neighborhoods. Well  this was an unbelievably ambitious idea  ambitious because communities had to approve those plans. So how was I going to get this done  By listening. So I began listening  in fact  thousands of hours of listening just to establish trust. You know  communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods. It's not something you can just fake. And so I began walking. I can't tell you how many blocks I walked  in sweltering summers  in freezing winters  year after year  just so I could get to understand the DNA of each neighborhood and know what each street felt like. I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert  finding ways that zoning could address communities' concerns. So little by little  neighborhood by neighborhood  block by block  we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit. Over the course of    years  we were able to rezone     neighborhoods     percent of the city         blocks  so that now     percent of all new development of New York is within a    minute walk of a subway. In other words  nobody in those new buildings needs to own a car. Well  those rezonings were exhausting and enervating and important  but rezoning was never my mission. You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning. My mission was always to create great public spaces. So in the areas where we zoned for significant development  I was determined to create places that would make a difference in people's lives. Here you see what was two miles of abandoned  degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn  impossible to get to and impossible to use. Now the zoning here was massive  so I felt an obligation to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts  and I spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans. I wanted to make sure that there were tree lined paths from the upland to the water  that there were trees and plantings everywhere  and  of course  lots and lots of places to sit. Honestly  I had no idea how it would turn out. I had to have faith. But I put everything that I had studied and learned into those plans. And then it opened  and I have to tell you  it was incredible. People came from all over the city to be in these parks. I know they changed the lives of the people who live there  but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image of their city. I often come down and watch people get on this little ferry that now runs between the boroughs  and I can't tell you why  but I'm completely moved by the fact that people are using it as if it had always been there. And here is a new park in lower Manhattan. Now  the water's edge in lower Manhattan was a complete mess before     . Wall Street was essentially landlocked because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge. And after       the city had very little control. But I thought if we went to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan. And it did. Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides. I really love this park. You know  railings have to be higher now  so we put bar seating at the edge  and you can get so close to the water you're practically on it. And see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop. And I love when people come there and look up and they say   Wow  there's Brooklyn  and it's so close.  So what's the trick  How do you turn a park into a place that people want to be  Well  it's up to you  not as a city planner but as a human being. You don't tap into your design expertise. You tap into your humanity. I mean  would you want to go there  Would you want to stay there  Can you see into it and out of it  Are there other people there  Does it seem green and friendly  Can you find your very own seat  Well now  all over New York City  there are places where you can find your very own seat. Where there used to be parking spaces  there are now pop up cafes. Where Broadway traffic used to run  there are now tables and chairs. Where    years ago  sidewalk cafes were not allowed  they are now everywhere. But claiming these spaces for public use was not simple  and it's even harder to keep them that way. So now I'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park called the High Line. The High Line was an elevated railway. The High Line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on Manhattan's West Side  and when the train stopped running  it became a self seeded landscape  a kind of a garden in the sky. And when I saw it the first time  honestly  when I went up on that old viaduct  I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person  honestly. And when I was appointed  saving the first two sections of the High Line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project. I knew if there was a day that I didn't worry about the High Line  it would come down. And the High Line  even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular  it is the most contested public space in the city. You might see a beautiful park  but not everyone does. You know  it's true  commercial interests will always battle against public space. You might say   How wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the High Line.  Well  a developer sees just one thing  customers. Hey  why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the High Line  Wouldn't that be terrific and won't it mean a lot more money for the city  Well no  it would not be terrific. It would be a mall  and not a park. And you know what  it might mean more money for the city  but a city has to take the long view  the view for the common good. Most recently  the last section of the High Line  the third section of the High Line  the final section of the High Line  has been pitted against development interests  where some of the city's leading developers are building more than    million square feet at the Hudson Yards. And they came to me and proposed that they  temporarily disassemble  that third and final section. Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a hill. Perhaps it was just in their way. But in any case  it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition  and that was only two years ago. So you see  no matter how popular and successful a public space may be  it can never be taken for granted. Public spaces always    this is it saved    public spaces always need vigilant champions  not only to claim them at the outset for public use  but to design them for the people that use them  then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone  that they are not violated  invaded  abandoned or ignored. If there is any one lesson that I have learned in my life as a city planner  it is that public spaces have power. It's not just the number of people using them  it's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there. Public space can change how you live in a city  how you feel about a city  whether you choose one city over another  and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city. I believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party. People stay because they are having a great time. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Right now there is an aspiring teacher who is working on a    page paper based on some age old education theory developed by some dead education professor wondering to herself what this task that she's engaging in has to do with what she wants to do with her life  which is be an educator  change lives  and spark magic. Right now there is an aspiring teacher in a graduate school of education who is watching a professor babble on and on about engagement in the most disengaging way possible. Right now there's a first year teacher at home who is pouring through lesson plans trying to make sense of standards  who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately  while at the same time saying to herself over and over again   Don't smile till November   because that's what she was taught in her teacher education program. Right now there's a student who is coming up with a way to convince his mom or dad that he's very  very sick and can't make it to school tomorrow. On the other hand  right now there are amazing educators that are sharing information  information that is shared in such a beautiful way that the students are sitting at the edge of their seats just waiting for a bead of sweat to drop off the face of this person so they can soak up all that knowledge. Right now there is also a person who has an entire audience rapt with attention  a person that is weaving a powerful narrative about a world that the people who are listening have never imagined or seen before  but if they close their eyes tightly enough  they can envision that world because the storytelling is so compelling. Right now there's a person who can tell an audience to put their hands up in the air and they will stay there till he says   Put them down.  Right now. So people will then say   Well  Chris  you describe the guy who is going through some awful training but you're also describing these powerful educators. If you're thinking about the world of education or urban education in particular  these guys will probably cancel each other out  and then we'll be okay.  The reality is  the folks I described as the master teachers  the master narrative builders  the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms. The folks who know the skills about how to teach and engage an audience don't even know what teacher certification means. They may not even have the degrees to be able to have anything to call an education. And that to me is sad. It's sad because the people who I described  they were very disinterested in the learning process  want to be effective teachers  but they have no models. I'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain. Mark Twain says that proper preparation  or teaching  is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good  it can turn awful practices into powerful ones  it can change men and transform them into angels. The folks who I described earlier got proper preparation in teaching  not in any college or university  but by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage. Guess where those places are  Barber shops  rap concerts  and most importantly  in the black church. And I've been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy. Who here has been to a black church  We got a couple of hands. You go to a black church  their preacher starts off and he realizes that he has to engage the audience  so he starts off with this sort of wordplay in the beginning oftentimes  and then he takes a pause  and he says   Oh my gosh  they're not quite paying attention.  So he says   Can I get an amen   Audience  Amen. Chris Emdin  So I can I get an amen  Audience  Amen. CE  And all of a sudden  everybody's reawoken. That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention. He drops his voice at a very  very low volume when he wants people to key into him  and those things are the skills that we need for the most engaging teachers. So why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about standards and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the basic skills  that magic that you need to engage an audience  to engage a student  So I make the argument that we reframe teacher education  that we could focus on content  and that's fine  and we could focus on theories  and that's fine  but content and theories with the absence of the magic of teaching and learning means nothing. Now people oftentimes say   Well  magic is just magic.  There are teachers who  despite all their challenges  who have those skills  get into those schools and are  able to engage an audience  and the administrator walks by and says   Wow  he's so good  I wish all my teachers could be that good.  And when they try to describe what that is  they just say   He has that magic.  But I'm here to tell you that magic can be taught. Magic can be taught. Magic can be taught. Now  how do you teach it  You teach it by allowing people to go into those spaces where the magic is happening. If you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education  you've got to leave the confines of that university and go into the hood. You've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop  you've got to attend that black church  and you've got to view those folks that have the power to engage and just take notes on what they do. At our teacher education classes at my university  I've started a project where every single student that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts. They watch the way that the rappers move and talk with their hands. They study the way that he walks proudly across that stage. They listen to his metaphors and analogies  and they start learning these little things that if they practice enough becomes the key to magic. They learn that if you just stare at a student and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch  you don't have to say a word because they know that that means that you want more. And if we could transform teacher education to focus on teaching teachers how to create that magic then poof  we could make dead classes come alive  we could reignite imaginations  and we can change education. Thank you. What is the intersection between technology  art and science  Curiosity and wonder  because it drives us to explore  because we're surrounded by things we can't see. And I love to use film to take us on a journey through portals of time and space  to make the invisible visible  because what that does  it expands our horizons  it transforms our perception  it opens our minds and it touches our heart. So here are some scenes from my  D IMAX film   Mysteries of the Unseen World.  There is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect  and time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life. We can see how organisms emerge and grow  how a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor to look at the sunlight. And at the grand scale  time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion. We can view not only the vast sweep of nature  but the restless movement of humanity. Each streaking dot represents a passenger plane  and by turning air traffic data into time lapse imagery  we can see something that's above us constantly but invisible  the vast network of air travel over the United States. We can do the same thing with ships at sea. We can turn data into a time lapse view of a global economy in motion. And decades of data give us the view of our entire planet as a single organism sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere  pulsing with lightning  crowned by the aurora Borealis. It may be the ultimate time lapse image  the anatomy of Earth brought to life. At the other extreme  there are things that move too fast for our eyes  but we have technology that can look into that world as well. With high speed cameras  we can do the opposite of time lapse. We can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision. And we can see how nature's ingenious devices work  and perhaps we can even imitate them. When a dragonfly flutters by  you may not realize  but it's the greatest flier in nature. It can hover  fly backwards  even upside down. And by tracking markers on an insect's wings  we can visualize the air flow that they produce. Nobody knew the secret  but high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wings in different directions at the same time. And what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places. We're giants  and we're unaware of things that are too small for us to see. The electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times. This is the egg of a butterfly. And there are unseen creatures living all over your body  including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes  crawling over your skin at night. Can you guess what this is  Shark skin. A caterpillar's mouth. The eye of a fruit fly. An eggshell. A flea. A snail's tongue. We think we know most of the animal kingdom  but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered. A spider also has great secrets  because spiders' silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel but completely elastic. This journey will take us all the way down to the nano world. The silk is     times thinner than human hair. On there is bacteria  and near that bacteria     times smaller  a virus. Inside of that     times smaller  three strands of DNA. And nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes  single carbon atoms. With the tip of a powerful microscope  we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices. Some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way. Tiny chemical machines of the future can one day  perhaps  repair DNA. We are on the threshold of extraordinary advances  born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life. So under an endless rain of cosmic dust  the air is full of pollen  micro diamonds and jewels from other planets and supernova explosions. People go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable. Knowing that there's so much around us we can't see forever changes our understanding of the world  and by looking at unseen worlds  we recognize that we exist in the living universe  and this new perspective creates wonder and inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards. Who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives. We'll just have to see. Thank you. I was born and raised in Sierra Leone  a small and very beautiful country in West Africa  a country rich both in physical resources and creative talent. However  Sierra Leone is infamous for a decade long rebel war in the '  s when entire villages were burnt down. An estimated       men  women and children had their arms and legs amputated during this time. As my family and I ran for safety when I was about    from one of those attacks  I resolved that I would do everything I could to ensure that my own children would not go through the  same experiences we had. They would  in fact  be part of a Sierra Leone where war and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power. As I watched people who I knew  loved ones  recover from this devastation  one thing that deeply troubled me was that many of the amputees in the country would not use their prostheses. The reason  I would come to find out  was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well. The prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb  and which connects to the prosthetic ankle. Even in the developed world  it takes a period of three weeks to often years for a patient to get a comfortable socket  if ever. Prosthetists still use conventional processes like molding and casting to create single material prosthetic sockets. Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts of pressure on the limbs of the patient  leaving them with pressure sores and blisters. It does not matter how powerful your prosthetic ankle is. If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable  you will not use your leg  and that is just simply unacceptable in our age. So one day  when I met professor Hugh Herr about two and a half years ago  and he asked me if I knew  how to solve this problem  I said   No  not yet  but I would love to figure it out.  And so  for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab  I designed custom prosthetic sockets quickly and cheaply that are more comfortable than conventional prostheses. I used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy  then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces  and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture. We use a  D printer to create a multi material prosthetic socket which relieves pressure where needed on the anatomy of the patient. In short  we're using data to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply. In a recent trial we just wrapped up at the Media Lab  one of our patients  a U.S. veteran who has been an amputee for about    years and worn dozens of legs  said of one of our printed parts   It's so soft  it's like walking on pillows  and it's effing sexy.  Disability in our age should not prevent anyone from living meaningful lives. My hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them. For me  a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and disease is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies. Whether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston  I hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential. Thank you very much. Pat Mitchell  That day  January          began like all others. You were both doing the work that you love. You were meeting with constituents  which is something that you loved doing as a congresswoman  and Mark  you were happily preparing for your next space shuttle. And suddenly  everything  that you had planned or expected in your lives was irrevocably changed forever. Mark Kelly  Yeah  it's amazing  it's amazing how  everything can change for any of us in an instant. People don't realize that. I certainly didn't. Gabby Giffords  Yes. MK  And on that Saturday morning  I got this horrible phone call from Gabby's chief of staff. She didn't have much other information. She just said   Gabby was shot.  A few minutes later  I called her back and I actually thought for a second  well  maybe I just imagined  getting this phone call. I called her back  and  that's when she told me that Gabby had been shot in the head. And from that point on  I knew that our lives were  going to be a lot different. PM  And when you arrived at the hospital  what was the prognosis that they gave you about Gabby's condition  and what recovery  if any  you could expect  MK  Well  for a gunshot wound to the head and a traumatic brain injury  they typically can't tell you much. Every injury is different. It's not predictable like often a stroke might be predictable  which is another TBI kind of injury. So they didn't know how long Gabby would be in a coma  didn't know when that would change and what the prognosis would be. PM  Gabby  has your recovery been an effort to create  a new Gabby Giffords or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords  GG  The new one    better  stronger  tougher. MK  That to say  when you look at the picture behind us  to come back from that kind of injury and come back strong  and stronger than ever is a really tough thing to do. I don't know anybody that's as tough as my  wonderful wife right here. PM  And what were the first signs that recovery was not  only going to be possible but you were going to have some semblance of the life that you and Gabby had planned  MK  Well  the first thing  for me  was Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious  but she did something when she was in the ICU hospital bed that she used to do when we might be out to dinner at a restaurant  in that she pulled my ring off and she flipped it from one finger to the next  and at that point I knew that she was still in there. PM  And there were certain words  too. Didn't she surprise you with  words in the beginning  MK  Well  it was tough in the beginning. GG  What  What  Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. MK  Yeah  that was it. For the first month  that was the extent of Gabby's vocabulary. For some reason  she has aphasia  which is difficulty with communication. She latched on to the word  chicken   which isn't the best but  certainly is not the worst. And we were actually worried it could have been a lot worse than that. PM  Gabby  what's been  the toughest challenge for you during this recovery  GG  Talking. Really hard. Really. MK  Yeah  with aphasia  Gabby knows what she wants to say  she just can't get it out. She understands everything  but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture  the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head  which is where the bullet passed through. PM  So you have to do  a very dangerous thing  speak for your wife. MK  I do. It might be some of the most dangerous things I've ever done. PM  Gabby  are you optimistic about your continuing recovery    walking  talking  being able to move your arm and leg  GG  I'm optimistic. It will be a long  hard haul  but I'm optimistic. PM  That seems to be the number one  characteristic of Gabby Giffords  wouldn't you say   Applause  MK  Gabby's always been really optimistic. She works incredibly hard every day. GG  On the treadmill   walked on my treadmill  Spanish lessons  French horn. MK  It's only my wife who could be    and if you knew her before she was injured  you would kind of understand this    somebody who could be injured and have such a hard time communicating and meets with a speech therapist  and then about a month ago  she says   I want to learn Spanish again.  PM  Well  let's take a little closer look at the wife  and this was even before you met Gabby Giffords. And she's on a motor scooter there  but it's my understanding that's a very tame image of what Gabby Giffords was like growing up. MK  Yeah  Gabby  she  used to race motorcycles. So that's a scooter  but she had    well  she still has a BMW motorcycle. PM  Does she ride it  MK  Well  that's a challenge with not being able to move her right arm  but I think with something I know about  Velcro  we might be able to get her back on the bike  Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar. PM  I have a feeling we might  see that picture next  Gabby. But you meet  you're already decided that you're going to dedicate  your life to service. You're going into the military and eventually to become an astronaut. So you meet. What attracts you to Gabby  MK  Well  when we met  oddly enough  it was the last time we were in Vancouver  about    years ago. We met in Vancouver  at the airport  on a trip  that we were both taking to China  that I would actually  from my background  I would call it a boondoggle. Gabby would   GG  Fact finding mission. MK  She would call it an important fact finding mission. She was a state senator at the time  and we met here  at the airport  before a trip to China. PM  Would you describe it  as a whirlwind romance  GG  No  no  no. A good friend. MK  Yeah  we were friends for a long time. GG  Yes.  Laughter  MK  And then she invited me on  about a year or so later  she invited me on a date. Where'd we go  Gabby  GG  Death row. MK  Yes. Our first date was to death row at the Florence state prison in Arizona  which was just outside  Gabby's state senate district. They were working on some legislation that had to do with crime and punishment and capital punishment  in the state of Arizona. So she couldn't get anybody  else to go with her  and I'm like   Of course I  want to go to death row.  So that was our first date. We've been together ever since. GG  Yes. PM  Well  that might have contributed to the reason that Gabby decided to marry you. You were willing to go to death row  after all. MK  I guess. PM  Gabby  what did make you want to marry Mark  GG  Um  good friends. Best friends. Best friends. MK  I thought we always had a very special relationship. We've gone through some tough times and it's only made it stronger. GG  Stronger. PM  After you got married  however  you continued very independent lives. Actually  you didn't even live together. MK  We had one of those commuter marriages. In our case  it was Washington  D.C.  Houston  Tucson. Sometimes we'd go clockwise  sometimes counterclockwise  to all those different places  and we didn't really live together until that Saturday morning. Within an hour of Gabby being shot  I was on an airplane to Tucson  and that was the moment where that had changed things. PM  And also  Gabby  you had run for Congress after being a state senator and served in Congress for six years. What did you like best about being in Congress  GG  Fast pace. Fast pace. PM  Well it was the way you did it. GG  Yes  yes. Fast pace. PM  I'm not sure people would describe it entirely that way. MK  Yeah  you know  legislation is often at a colossally slow pace  but my wife  and I have to admit  a lot of other members of Congress that I know  work incredibly hard. I mean  Gabby would run  around like a crazy person  never take a day off  maybe a half a day off a month  and whenever she was awake she was working  and she really  really thrived on that  and still does today. GG  Yes. Yes. PM  Installing solar panels on the top of her house  I have to say. So after the tragic incident  Mark  you decided to resign your position as an astronaut  even though you were supposed to take the next space mission. Everybody  including Gabby  talked you into going back  and you did end up taking. MK  Kind of. The day after Gabby was injured  I called my boss  the chief astronaut  Dr. Peggy Whitson  and I said   Peggy  I know I'm launching in space in three months from now. Gabby's in a coma. I'm in Tucson. You've got to find a replacement for me.  So I didn't actually resign from being an astronaut  but I gave up my job and they found a replacement. Months later  maybe about two months later  I started about getting my job back  which is something  when you become this primary caregiver person  which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position  it's a challenging role but at some point you've got to figure out when you're going to get your life back  and at the time  I couldn't ask Gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again. But I knew she was  GG  Yes. Yes. Yes. MK  She was the biggest  supporter of my career  and I knew it was the right thing to do. PM  And yet I'm trying to imagine  Mark  what that was like  going off onto a mission  one presumes safely   but it's never a guarantee  and knowing that Gabby is   MK  Well not only was  she still in the hospital  on the third day of that flight  literally while I was rendezvousing with the space station  and you've got two vehicles moving at        miles an hour  I'm actually flying it  looking out the window  a bunch of computers  Gabby was in brain surgery  literally at that time having the final surgery to replace the piece of skull that they took out on the day she was injured with a prosthetic  yeah  which is the whole side of her head. Now if any of you guys would ever come to our house in Tucson for the first time  Gabby would usually go up to the freezer and pull out the piece of Tupperware that has the real skull.  Laughter  GG  The real skull. MK  Which freaks people out  sometimes. PM  Is that for appetizer or dessert  Mark  MK  Well  it just gets the conversation going. PM  But there was a lot  of conversation about something you did  Gabby  after Mark's flight. You had to make another  step of courage too  because here was  Congress deadlocked again  and you got out of the rehabilitation center  got yourself to Washington so that you could walk  on the floor of the House    I can barely talk about this without getting emotional   and cast a vote which could have been the deciding vote. GG  The debt ceiling. The debt ceiling. MK  Yeah  we had that vote  I guess about five months after Gabby was injured  and she made this bold decision to go back. A very controversial vote  but she wanted to be there to have her voice heard one more time. PM  And after that  resigned and began what has been a very slow and challenging recovery. What's life like  day to day  MK  Well  that's Gabby's service dog Nelson. GG  Nelson. MK  New member of our family. GG  Yes  yes. MK  And we got him from a  GG  Prison. Murder. MK  We have a lot of connections with prisons  apparently.  Laughter  Nelson came from a prison  raised by a murderer in Massachusetts. But she did a great job with this dog. He's a fabulous service dog. PM  So Gabby  what have you learned from your experiences the past few years  MK  Yeah  what have you learned  GG  Deeper. Deeper. PM  Your relationship is deeper. It has to be. You're together all the time now. MK  I imagine being grateful  too  right  GG  Grateful. PM  This is a picture of  family and friends gathering  but I love these pictures because they show the Gabby and Mark relationship now. And you describe it  Gabby  over and over  as deeper on so many levels. Yes  MK  I think when something tragic happens in a family  it can pull people together. Here's us watching the space shuttle fly over Tucson  the Space Shuttle Endeavour  the one that I was the  commander on its last flight  on its final flight on top of an airplane on a     on its way to L.A.  NASA was kind enough  to have it fly over Tucson. PM  And of course  the two of you go through these challenges of a slow and difficult recovery  and yet  Gabby  how do you maintain your optimism and positive outlook  GG  I want to make the world a better place. PM  And you're doing that even though your recovery has to remain front and center for both of you. You are people who have done service to your country and you  are continuing to do that with a new initiative  a new purpose. And Gabby  what's on the agenda now  GG  Americans for Responsible Solutions. MK  That's our political action committee  where we are trying to  get members of Congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country  and to try to pass some reasonable legislation. GG  Yes. Yes.  Applause  MK  You know  this affected  us very personally  but it wasn't what happened to Gabby that got us involved. It was really the    murdered first graders and kindergartners in Newtown  Connecticut  and the response that we saw afterwards where    well  look what's happened so far. So far the national response has been pretty much to do nothing. We're trying to change that. PM  There have been    mass shootings since Newtown  a school a week in the first  two months of last year. What are you doing that's different than other efforts to balance rights for gun ownership and responsibilities  MK  We're gun owners   we support gun rights. At the same time  we've  got to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. It's not too difficult to do that. This issue  like many others  has become very polarizing and political  and we're trying to bring some balance to the debate in Washington. PM  Thank you both for that effort. And not surprisingly for  this woman of courage and of a sense of adventure  you just keep challenging yourself  and the sky seems to be the limit. I have to share this video of your most recent adventure. Take a look at Gabby. MK  This is a couple months ago. Good stuff. Gorgeous. Oh  thank you. Mountains. Gorgeous mountains. MK  Let me just say one of the guys that Gabby jumped with that day was a Navy SEAL who she met in Afghanistan who was injured in combat  had a really rough time. Gabby visited him when he was at Bethesda and went through a really tough period. He started doing better. Months later  Gabby was shot in the head  and then he supported her while she was in the hospital in Houston. So they have a very  very nice connection. GG  Yes. PM  What a wonderful moment. Because this is the TED stage  Gabby  I know you worked very hard to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave with this audience. GG  Thank you. Hello  everyone. Thank you for inviting us here today. It's been a long  hard haul  but I'm getting better. I'm working hard  lots of therapy    speech therapy  physical therapy  and yoga too. But my spirit is strong as ever. I'm still fighting to make  the world a better place  and you can too. Get involved with your community. Be a leader. Set an example. Be passionate. Be courageous. Be your best. Thank you very much. MK  Thank you. GG  Thank you. MK  Thank you everybody. GG  Bye bye.  Applause  So I've been thinking about the difference between the r sum  virtues and  the eulogy virtues. The r sum  virtues are the ones you put on your r sum   which are the skills  you bring to the marketplace. The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy  which are deeper  who are you   in your depth  what is the nature of your relationships  are you bold  loving  dependable  consistency  And most of us  including  me  would say that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues. But at least in my case   are they the ones that I think about the most   And the answer is no. So I've been thinking about that problem  and a thinker who has  helped me think about it is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik  who was a rabbi who wrote a book called  The Lonely Man Of Faith  in     . Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures  which he called Adam I and Adam II. Adam I is the worldly  ambitious  external side of our nature. He wants to build  create  create companies  create innovation. Adam II is the humble side of our nature. Adam II wants not only  to do good but to be good  to live in a way internally that honors God  creation and our possibilities. Adam I wants to conquer the world. Adam II wants to hear  a calling and obey the world. Adam I savors accomplishment. Adam II savors inner  consistency and strength. Adam I asks how things work. Adam II asks why we're here. Adam I's motto is  success.  Adam II's motto is  love  redemption and return.  And Soloveitchik argued  that these two sides of our nature are  at war with each other. We live in perpetual self confrontation between the external success and the internal value. And the tricky thing   I'd say  about these two sides of our nature is they work by different logics. The external logic is  an economic logic  input leads to output   risk leads to reward. The internal side of our nature is a moral logic and  often an inverse logic. You have to give to receive. You have to surrender  to something outside yourself to gain strength within yourself. You have to conquer the desire to get what you want. In order to fulfill yourself  you have to forget yourself. In order to find yourself   you have to lose yourself. We happen to live in a society  that favors Adam I  and often neglects Adam II. And the problem is  that turns you into a shrewd animal who treats life as a game  and you become a cold   calculating creature who slips into a sort of mediocrity where you realize there's a difference between your desired  self and your actual self. You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want  you hope someone will give to you. You don't have the  depth of conviction. You don't have an emotional sonorousness. You don't have  commitment to tasks that would take more than a lifetime to commit. I was reminded of a common response through history of how you build a solid Adam II  how you build a depth of character. Through history  people  have gone back into their own pasts  sometimes to a precious  time in their life  to their childhood  and often  the mind  gravitates in the past to a moment of shame  some sin committed   some act of selfishness  an act of omission  of shallowness  the sin of anger  the sin of self pity  trying to be a people pleaser   a lack of courage. Adam I is built by  building on your strengths. Adam II is built by fighting  your weaknesses. You go into yourself   you find the sin which you've committed over and again through your life  your signature sin out of which the others emerge  and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin  and out of that wrestling   that suffering  then a depth of character is constructed. And we're often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves  in that we're not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it  how to confront it   and how to combat it. We live in a culture  with an Adam I mentality where we're inarticulate  about Adam II. Finally  Reinhold Niebuhr summed up the confrontation  the fully lived Adam I and Adam II life  this way   Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime  therefore we must  be saved by hope. Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history  therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do  however virtuous  can be accomplished alone  therefore we must  be saved by love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint. Therefore we must be saved  by that final form of love  which is forgiveness.  Thanks. When I was born  there was really only one book about how to raise your children  and it was written by Dr. Spock. Thank you for indulging me. I have always wanted to do that. No  it was Benjamin Spock  and his book was called  The Common Sense Book of Baby And Child Care.  It sold almost    million copies  by the time he died. Today  I  as the mother of a six year old  walk into Barnes and Noble  and see this. And it is amazing the variety that one finds  on those shelves. There are guides to raising  an eco friendly kid  a gluten free kid  a disease proof kid  which  if you ask me  is a little bit creepy. There are guides to raising a bilingual kid even if you only speak one language at home. There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid and a science minded kid and a kid who is a whiz at yoga. Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse a nuclear bomb  there is pretty much a guide to everything. All of these books are well intentioned. I am sure that many of them are great. But taken together  I am sorry  I do not see help when I look at that shelf. I see anxiety. I see a giant candy colored monument to our collective panic  and it makes me want to know  why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion  Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens about the one thing human beings have been doing successfully for millennia  long before parenting message boards and peer reviewed studies came along  Why is it that so many mothers and fathers experience parenthood as a kind of crisis  Crisis might seem like a strong word  but there is data suggesting it probably isn't. There was  in fact  a paper of just this very name   Parenthood as Crisis   published in       and in the    plus years since  there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish. Parents experience more stress than non parents. Their marital satisfaction is lower. There have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids  and the answer often is  not so great. Last year  I spoke with a researcher named Matthew Killingsworth who is doing a very  very imaginative project that tracks people's happiness  and here is what he told me he found   Interacting with your friends is better than interacting with your spouse  which is better than interacting with other relatives  which is better than interacting with acquaintances  which is better than interacting with parents  which is better than interacting with children. Who are on par with strangers.  But here's the thing. I have been looking at what underlies these data for three years  and children are not the problem. Something about parenting right now at this moment is the problem. Specifically  I don't think we know what parenting is supposed to be. Parent  as a verb  only entered common usage in     . Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed. The roles of our children have changed. We are all now furiously improvising our way through a situation for which there is no script  and if you're an amazing jazz musician  then improv is great  but for the rest of us  it can kind of feel like a crisis. So how did we get here  How is it that we are all now navigating a child rearing universe without any norms to guide us  Well  for starters  there has been a major historical change. Until fairly recently  kids worked  on our farms primarily  but also in factories  mills  mines. Kids were considered economic assets. Sometime during the Progressive Era  we put an end to this arrangement. We recognized kids had rights  we banned child labor  we focused on education instead  and school became a child's new work. And thank God it did. But that only made a parent's role more confusing in a way. The old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical  but it was reciprocal. We provided food  clothing  shelter  and moral instruction to our kids  and they in return provided income. Once kids stopped working  the economics of parenting changed. Kids became  in the words of one brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist   economically worthless but emotionally priceless.  Rather than them working for us  we began to work for them  because within only a matter of decades it became clear  if we wanted our kids to succeed  school was not enough. Today  extracurricular activities are a kid's new work  but that's work for us too  because we are the ones driving them to soccer practice. Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work  but that's also work for us  because we have to check it. About three years ago  a Texas woman told something to me that totally broke my heart. She said  almost casually   Homework is the new dinner.  The middle class now pours all of its time and energy and resources into its kids  even though the middle class has less and less of those things to give. Mothers now spend more time with their children than they did in       when most women were not even in the workforce. It would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for. This is yet another thing that makes modern parenting so very confounding. We have no clue what portion our wisdom  if any  is of use to our kids. The world is changing so rapidly  it's impossible to say. This was true even when I was young. When I was a kid  high school specifically  I was told that I would be at sea in the new global economy if I did not know Japanese. And with all due respect to the Japanese  it didn't turn out that way. Now there is a certain kind of middle class parent that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin  and maybe they're onto something  but we cannot know for sure. So  absent being able to anticipate the future  what we all do  as good parents  is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future  hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off. We teach our kids chess  thinking maybe they will need analytical skills. We sign them up for team sports  thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills  you know  for when they go to Harvard Business School. We try and teach them to be financially savvy and science minded and eco friendly and gluten free  though now is probably a good time to tell you that I was not eco friendly and gluten free as a child. I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef. And you know what  I'm doing okay. I pay my taxes. I hold down a steady job. I was even invited to speak at TED. But the presumption now is that what was good enough for me  or for my folks for that matter  isn't good enough anymore. So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf  because we feel like if we aren't trying everything  it's as if we're doing nothing and we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids. So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles as mothers and fathers. Now add to this problem something else  we are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce. This is another reason  I think  that parenthood feels like a crisis. We have no rules  no scripts  no norms for what to do when a child comes along now that both mom and dad are breadwinners. The writer Michael Lewis once put this very  very well. He said that the surest way for a couple to start fighting is for them to go out to dinner with another couple whose division of labor is ever so slightly different from theirs  because the conversation in the car on the way home goes something like this   So  did you catch that Dave is the one who walks them to school every morning   Without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world  couples fight  and both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gripes. Mothers are much more likely to be multi tasking when they are at home  and fathers  when they are at home  are much more likely to be mono tasking. Find a guy at home  and odds are he is doing just one thing at a time. In fact  UCLA recently did a study looking at the most common configuration of family members in middle class homes. Guess what it was  Dad in a room by himself. According to the American Time Use Survey  mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers  which is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day  but I still think that something she wrote is highly relevant   I have not been alone in the bathroom since October.  But here is the thing  Men are doing plenty. They spend more time with their kids than their fathers ever spent with them. They work more paid hours  on average  than their wives  and they genuinely want to be good  involved dads. Today  it is fathers  not mothers  who report the most work life conflict. Either way  by the way  if you think it's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles  just imagine what it's like now for non traditional families  families with two dads  families with two moms  single parent households. They are truly improvising as they go. Now  in a more progressive country  and forgive me here for capitulating to clich  and invoking  yes  Sweden  parents could rely on the state for support. There are countries that acknowledge the anxieties and the changing roles of mothers and fathers. Unfortunately  the United States is not one of them  so in case you were wondering what the U.S. has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia  it's this  We too have no paid maternity leave policy. We are one of eight known countries that does not. In this age of intense confusion  there is just one goal upon which all parents can agree  and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms  helicopters or drones  our kids' happiness is paramount. That is what it means to raise kids in an age when they are economically worthless but emotionally priceless. We are all the custodians of their self esteem. The one mantra no parent ever questions is   All I want is for my children to be happy.  And don't get me wrong  I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child. But it is a very elusive one. Happiness and self confidence  teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field. It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike. There's no curriculum for it. Happiness and self confidence can be the byproducts of other things  but they cannot really be goals unto themselves. A child's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent. And happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid. And I have to tell you  I think it leads to some very strange excesses. We are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world's ugliness that we now shield them from  Sesame Street.  I wish I could say I was kidding about this  but if you go out and you buy the first few episodes of  Sesame Street  on DVD  as I did out of nostalgia  you will find a warning at the beginning saying that the content is not suitable for children. Can I just repeat that  The content of the original  Sesame Street  is not suitable for children. When asked about this by The New York Times  a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations. One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe in one skit and then swallowed it. Bad modeling. I don't know. But the thing that stuck with me is she said that she didn't know whether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today because he was too depressive. I cannot tell you how much this distresses me. You are looking at a woman who has a periodic table of the Muppets hanging from her cubicle wall. The offending muppet  right there. That's my son the day he was born. I was high as a kite on morphine. I had had an unexpected C section. But even in my opiate haze  I managed to have one very clear thought the first time I held him. I whispered it into his ear. I said   I will try so hard not to hurt you.  It was the Hippocratic Oath  and I didn't even know I was saying it. But it occurs to me now that the Hippocratic Oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness. In fact  as any parent will tell you  it's awfully hard. All of us have said or done hurtful things that we wish to God we could take back. I think in another era we did not expect quite so much from ourselves  and it is important that we all remember that the next time we are staring with our hearts racing at those bookshelves. I'm not really sure how to create new norms for this world  but I do think that in our desperate quest to create happy kids  we may be assuming the wrong moral burden. It strikes me as a better goal  and  dare I say  a more virtuous one  to focus on making productive kids and moral kids  and to simply hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of the good that they do and their accomplishments and the love that they feel from us. That  anyway  is one response to having no script. Absent having new scripts  we just follow the oldest ones in the book    decency  a work ethic  love   and let happiness and self esteem take care of themselves. I think if we all did that  the kids would still be all right  and so would their parents  possibly in both cases even better. Thank you. I want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you    or  if you were delivering  about the person you were delivering. And you can all mouth it if you want or say it out loud. It was    the first two were   It's a ...  Audience   Mixed reply  Girl. Boy. Well  it shows you that    I also deal with issues where there's not certainty of whether it's a girl or a boy  so the mixed answer was very appropriate. Of course  now the answer often comes not at birth but at the ultrasound  unless the prospective parents choose to be surprised  like we all were. But I want you to think about what it is that leads to that statement on the third word  because the third word is a description of your sex. And by that I mean  made by a description of your genitals. Now  as a pediatric endocrinologist  I used to be very  very involved and still somewhat am  in cases in which there are mismatches in the externals or between the externals and the internals  and we literally have to figure out what is the description of your sex. But there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth that would define you. And when I talk about definition  I'm talking about your sexual orientation. We don't say   It's a ... gay boy    A lesbian girl   Those situations don't really define themselves more until the second decade of life. Nor do they define your gender  which  as different from your anatomic sex  describes your self concept  Do you see yourself as a male or female  or somewhere in the spectrum in between  That sometimes shows up in the first decade of life  but it can be very confusing for parents  because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross gender play and way  and  in fact  there are studies that show that even    percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins. But  at the time that puberty begins    that means between about age    to    in girls     to    in boys    with breast budding  or two to three times' increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males  by that particular point  the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body is almost certain to be transgender and is extremely unlikely to change those feelings  no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things. Now  this is relatively rare  so I had relatively little personal experience with this. And my experience was more typical  only because I had an adolescent practice. And I saw someone age     genetically female  went through Harvard with three male roommates who knew the whole story  a registrar who always listed his name on course lists as a male name  and came to me after graduating  saying   Help me. I know you know a lot of endocrinology.  And indeed  I've treated a lot of people who were born without gonads. This wasn't rocket science. But I made a deal with him   I'll treat you if you teach me.  And so he did. And what an education I got from taking care of all the members of his support group. And then I got really confused  because I thought it was relatively easy at that age to just give people the hormones of the gender in which they were affirming. But then my patient married  and he married a woman who had been born as a male  had married as a male  had two children  then went through a transition into female. And now this delightful female was attached to my male patient    in fact  got legally married  because they showed up as a man and a woman  and who knew  right  And I was confused     Does this make so and so gay  Does this make so and so straight   I was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity. And my patient said to me   Look  look  look. If you just think of the following  you'll get it right  Sexual orientation is who you go to bed with. Gender identity is who you go to bed as.  And I subsequently learned from the many adults    I took care of about     adults    I learned from them that if I didn't peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room  I would never be able to guess better than chance  whether they were gay  straight  bi or asexual in their affirmed gender. In other words  one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other. And the data show it. Now  as I took care of the     adults  I found it extremely painful. These people    many of them    had to give up so much of their lives. Sometimes their parents would reject them  siblings  their own children  and then their divorcing spouse would forbid them from seeing their children. It was so awful  but why did they do it at    and     Because they felt they had to affirm themselves before they would kill themselves. And indeed  the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people is among the highest in the world. So  what to do  I was intrigued  in going to a conference in Holland  where they are experts in this  and saw the most remarkable thing. They were treating young adolescents after giving them the most intense psychometric testing of gender  and they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn't want. Because basically  kids look about the same  each sex  until they go through puberty  at which point  if you feel you're in the wrong sex  you feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey. The fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be  with puberty  actually is nullified by the puberty you get. And they fall apart. So that's why putting the puberty on hold    why on hold  You can't just give them the opposite hormones that young. They'll end up stunted in growth  and you think you can have a meaningful conversation about the fertility effects of such treatment with a    year old girl  a    year old boy  So this buys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years  so that they can work it out. They can have more and more testing  they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them. And then  in a program they call           around age    is when they give the blocking hormones  and then at age     with retesting  they re qualify to receive    now remember  the blocking hormones are reversible  but when you give the hormones of the opposite sex  you now start spouting breasts and facial hair and voice change  depending on what you're using  and those effects are permanent  or require surgery to remove  or electrolysis  and you can never really affect the voice. So this is serious  and this is         year old stuff. And then at     they're eligible for surgery. And while there's no good surgery for females to males genitally  the male to female surgery has fooled gynecologists. That's how good it can be. So I looked at how the patients were doing  and I looked at patients who just looked like everybody else  except they were pubertally delayed. But once they gave them the hormones consistent with the gender they affirm  they look beautiful. They look normal. They had normal heights. You would never be able to pick them out in a crowd. So at that point  I decided I'm going to do this. This is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in  because  in fact  if you're going to deal with it in kids aged    to     that's pediatric endocrinology. So I brought some kids in  and this now became the standard of care  and the  Boston  Children's Hospital was behind it. By my showing them the kids before and after  people who never got treated and people who wished to be treated  and pictures of the Dutch    they came to me and said   You've got to do something for these kids.  Well  where were these kids before  They were out there suffering  is where they were. So we started a program in     . It became the first program of its kind    but it's really of the Dutch kind    in North America. And since then  we have     patients. Did they come from Afghanistan  No.    percent of them came from within     miles of Boston. And some came from England. Jackie had been abused in the Midlands  in England. She's    years old there  she was living as a girl  but she was being beaten up. It was a horror show  they had to homeschool her. And the reason the British were coming was because they would not treat anybody with anything under age     which means they were consigning them to an adult body no matter what happened  even if they tested them well. Jackie  on top of it  was  by virtue of skeletal markings  destined to be six feet five. And yet  she had just begun a male puberty. Well  I did something a little bit innovative  because I do know hormones  and that estrogen is much more potent in closing epiphyses  the growth plates  and stopping growth  than testosterone is. So we blocked her testosterone with a blocking hormone  but we added estrogen  not at     but at   . And so here she is at     on the left. And on her   th birthday  she went to Thailand  where they would do a genital plastic surgery. They will do it at    now. And she ended up  '   . But more than that  she has normal breast size  because by blocking testosterone  every one of our patients has normal breast size if they get to us at the appropriate age  not too late. And on the far right  there she is. She went public    semifinalist in the Miss England competition. The judges debated as to  can they do this  And one of them quipped  I'm told   But she has more natural self than half the other contestants.  And some of them have been rearranged a little bit  but it's all her DNA. And she's become a remarkable spokeswoman. And she was offered contracts as a model  at which point she teased me  when she said   You know  I might have had a better chance as a model if you'd made me six feet one.  Go figure. So this picture  I think  says it all. It really says it all. These are Nicole and brother Jonas  identical twin boys  and proven to be identical. Nicole had affirmed herself as a girl as early as age three. At age seven  they changed her name  and came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty. Now you can imagine looking at Jonas at only     that male puberty is early in this family  because he looks more like a    year old. But it makes the point all the more  of why you have to be conscious of where the patient is. Nicole is on pubertal blockade in here  and Jonas is just going    biologic control. This is what Nicole would look like if we weren't doing what we were doing. He's got a prominent Adam's apple. He's got angular bones to the face  a mustache  and you can see there's a height difference  because he's gone through a growth spurt that she won't get. Now Nicole is on estrogen. She has a bit of a form to her. This family went to the White House last spring  because of their work in overturning an anti discrimination    there was a bill that would block the right of transgender people in Maine to use public bathrooms  and it looked like the bill was going to pass  and that would have been a problem  but Nicole went personally to every legislator in Maine and said   I can do this. If they see me  they'll understand why I'm no threat in the ladies' room  but I can be threatened in the men's room.  And then they finally got it. So where do we go from here  Well  we still have a ways to go in terms of anti discrimination. There are only    states that have an anti discrimination law against discrimination in housing  employment  public accommodation    only    states  and five of them are in New England. We need less expensive drugs. They cost a fortune. And we need to get this condition out of the DSM. It is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian  and that went out the window in       and the whole world changed. And this isn't going to break anybody's budget. This is not that common. But the risks of not doing anything for them not only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide  but it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society. Thank you. The universe is teeming with planets. I want us  in the next decade  to build a space telescope that'll be able to image an Earth about another star and figure out whether it can harbor life. My colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Princeton and I are working on technology that will be able to do just that in the coming years. Astronomers now believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet  and they speculate that up to one fifth of them have an Earth like planet that might be able to harbor life  but we haven't seen any of them. We've only detected them indirectly. This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot. It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in       when they turned it around as it was exiting the solar system to take a picture of the Earth from six billion kilometers away. I want to take that of an Earth like planet about another star. Why haven't we done that  Why is that hard  Well to see  let's imagine we take the Hubble Space Telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of Mars. We'll see something like that  a slightly blurry picture of the Earth  because we're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of Mars. Now let's move ten times further away. Here we are at the orbit of Uranus. It's gotten smaller  it's got less detail  less resolve. We can still see the little moon  but let's go ten times further away again. Here we are at the edge of the solar system  out at the Kuiper Belt. Now it's not resolved at all. It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's. But let's move yet again ten times further away. Here we are out at the Oort Cloud  outside the solar system  and we're starting to see the sun move into the field of view and get into where the planet is. One more time  ten times further away. Now we're at Alpha Centauri  our nearest neighbor star  and the planet is gone. All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that's ten billion times brighter than the planet  which should be in that little red circle. That's what we want to see. That's why it's hard. The light from the star is diffracting. It's scattering inside the telescope  creating that very bright image that washes out the planet. So to see the planet  we have to do something about all of that light. We have to get rid of it. I have a lot of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that  but I want to tell you about one today that I think is the coolest  and probably the most likely to get us an Earth in the next decade. It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer  the father of the space telescope  in       and he took his inspiration from an eclipse. You've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse. The moon has moved in front of the sun. It blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it. It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up and blocked that spotlight that's getting right in my eye  I can see you in the back row. Well  what's going on  Well the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth. We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow  we look back at the sun  and most of the light's been removed and we can see that dim  fine structure in the corona. Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space. We build a big screen  we fly it in space  we put it up in front of the star  we block out most of the light  we fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created  and boom  we get to see planets. Well that would look something like this. So there's that big screen  and there's no planets  because unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well  because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope. It's like water bending around a rock in a stream  and all that light just destroys the shadow. It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets. But Spitzer actually knew the answer. If we can feather the edges  soften those edges so we can control diffraction  well then we can see a planet  and in the last    years or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing that. It looks something like that. We call that our flower petal starshade. If we make the edges of those petals exactly right  if we control their shape  we can control diffraction  and now we have a great shadow. It's about    billion times dimmer than it was before  and we can see the planets beam out just like that. That  of course  has to be bigger than my thumb. That starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly        kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow  and then we can see those planets. This sounds formidable  but brilliant engineers  colleagues of mine at JPL  came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this. It starts wrapped around a hub. It separates from the telescope. The petals unfurl  they open up  the telescope turns around. Then you'll see it flip and fly out that        kilometers away from the telescope. It's going to move in front of the star just like that  creates a wonderful shadow. Boom  we get planets orbiting about it. Thank you. That's not science fiction. We've been working on this for the last five or six years. Last summer  we did a really cool test out in California at Northrop Grumman. So those are four petals. This is a sub scale star shade. It's about half the size of the one you just saw. You'll see the petals unfurl. Those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at JPL. Now you're seeing it deploy. Those petals have to rotate into place. The base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter. We ran this test    times  and    times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter. This has to be done very precisely  but if we can do this  if we can build this technology  if we can get it into space  you might see something like this. That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. If we can take a similar space telescope  slightly larger  put it out there  fly an occulter in front of it  what we might see is something like that    that's a family portrait of our solar system    but not ours. We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system as seen through an occulter  through a starshade like that. You can see Jupiter  you can see Saturn  Uranus  Neptune  and right there in the center  next to the residual light is that pale blue dot. That's Earth. We want to see that  see if there's water  oxygen  ozone  the things that might tell us that it could harbor life. I think this is the coolest possible science. That's why I got into doing this  because I think that will change the world. That will change everything when we see that. Thank you. Type is something we consume in enormous quantities. In much of the world  it's completely inescapable. But few consumers are concerned to know where a particular typeface came from or when or who designed it  if  indeed  there was any human agency involved in its creation  if it didn't just sort of materialize out of the software ether. But I do have to be concerned with those things. It's my job. I'm one of the tiny handful of people who gets badly bent out of shape by the bad spacing of the T and the E that you see there. I've got to take that slide off. I can't stand it. Nor can Chris. There. Good. So my talk is about the connection between technology and design of type. The technology has changed a number of times since I started work  photo  digital  desktop  screen  web. I've had to survive those changes and try to understand their implications for what I do for design. This slide is about the effect of tools on form. The two letters  the two K's  the one on your left  my right  is modern  made on a computer. All straight lines are dead straight. The curves have that kind of mathematical smoothness that the B zier formula imposes. On the right  ancient Gothic  cut in the resistant material of steel by hand. None of the straight lines are actually straight. The curves are kind of subtle. It has that spark of life from the human hand that the machine or the program can never capture. What a contrast. Well  I tell a lie. A lie at TED. I'm really sorry. Both of these were made on a computer  same software  same B zier curves  same font format. The one on your left was made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre  and I did the other one. The tool is the same  yet the letters are different. The letters are different because the designers are different. That's all. Zuzana wanted hers to look like that. I wanted mine to look like that. End of story. Type is very adaptable. Unlike a fine art  such as sculpture or architecture  type hides its methods. I think of myself as an industrial designer. The thing I design is manufactured  and it has a function  to be read  to convey meaning. But there is a bit more to it than that. There's the sort of aesthetic element. What makes these two letters different from different interpretations by different designers  What gives the work of some designers sort of characteristic personal style  as you might find in the work of a fashion designer  an automobile designer  whatever  There have been some cases  I admit  where I as a designer did feel the influence of technology. This is from the mid '  s  the change from metal type to photo  hot to cold. This brought some benefits but also one particular drawback  a spacing system that only provided    discrete units for letters to be accommodated on. I was asked at this time to design a series of condensed sans serif types with as many different variants as possible within this    unit box. Quickly looking at the arithmetic  I realized I could only actually make three of related design. Here you see them. In Helvetica Compressed  Extra Compressed  and Ultra Compressed  this rigid    unit system really boxed me in. It kind of determined the proportions of the design. Here are the typefaces  at least the lower cases. So do you look at these and say   Poor Matthew  he had to submit to a problem  and by God it shows in the results.  I hope not. If I were doing this same job today  instead of having    spacing units  I would have      . Clearly I could make more variants  but would these three members of the family be better  It's hard to say without actually doing it  but they would not be better in the proportion of       to     I can tell you that. My instinct tells you that any improvement would be rather slight  because they were designed as functions of the system they were designed to fit  and as I said  type is very adaptable. It does hide its methods. All industrial designers work within constraints. This is not fine art. The question is  does a constraint force a compromise  By accepting a constraint  are you working to a lower standard  I don't believe so  and I've always been encouraged by something that Charles Eames said. He said he was conscious of working within constraints  but not of making compromises. The distinction between a constraint and a compromise is obviously very subtle  but it's very central to my attitude to work. Remember this reading experience  The phone book. I'll hold the slide so you can enjoy the nostalgia. This is from the mid '  s early trials of Bell Centennial typeface I designed for the U.S. phone books  and it was my first experience of digital type  and quite a baptism. Designed for the phone books  as I said  to be printed at tiny size on newsprint on very high speed rotary presses with ink that was kerosene and lampblack. This is not a hospitable environment for a typographic designer. So the challenge for me was to design type that performed as well as possible in these very adverse production conditions. As I say  we were in the infancy of digital type. I had to draw every character by hand on quadrille graph paper    there were four weights of Bell Centennial   pixel by pixel  then encode them raster line by raster line for the keyboard. It took two years  but I learned a lot. These letters look as though they've been chewed by the dog or something or other  but the missing pixels at the intersections of strokes or in the crotches are the result of my studying the effects of ink spread on cheap paper and reacting  revising the font accordingly. These strange artifacts are designed to compensate for the undesirable effects of scale and production process. At the outset  AT T had wanted to set the phone books in Helvetica  but as my friend Erik Spiekermann said in the Helvetica movie  if you've seen that  the letters in Helvetica were designed to be as similar to one another as possible. This is not the recipe for legibility at small size. It looks very elegant up on a slide. I had to disambiguate these forms of the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial by sort of opening the shapes up  as you can see in the bottom part of that slide. So now we're on to the mid '  s  the early days of digital outline fonts  vector technology. There was an issue at that time with the size of the fonts  the amount of data that was required to find and store a font in computer memory. It limited the number of fonts you could get on your typesetting system at any one time. I did an analysis of the data  and found that a typical serif face you see on the left needed nearly twice as much data as a sans serif in the middle because of all the points required to define the elegantly curved serif brackets. The numbers at the bottom of the slide  by the way  they represent the amount of data needed to store each of the fonts. So the sans serif  in the middle  sans the serifs  was much more economical     to    .  Aha   I thought.  The engineers have a problem. Designer to the rescue.  I made a serif type  you can see it on the right  without curved serifs. I made them polygonal  out of straight line segments  chamfered brackets. And look  as economical in data as a sans serif. We call it Charter  on the right. So I went to the head of engineering with my numbers  and I said proudly   I have solved your problem.   Oh   he said.  What problem   And I said   Well  you know  the problem of the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on.   Oh   he said.  We solved that problem last week. We wrote a compaction routine that reduces the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude. You can have as many fonts on your system as you like.   Well  thank you for letting me know   I said. Foiled again. I was left with a design solution for a nonexistent technical problem. But here is where the story sort of gets interesting for me. I didn't just throw my design away in a fit of pique. I persevered. What had started as a technical exercise became an aesthetic exercise  really. In other words  I had come to like this typeface. Forget its origins. Screw that. I liked the design for its own sake. The simplified forms of Charter gave it a sort of plain spoken quality and unfussy spareness that sort of pleased me. You know  at times of technical innovation  designers want to be influenced by what's in the air. We want to respond. We want to be pushed into exploring something new. So Charter is a sort of parable for me  really. In the end  there was no hard and fast causal link between the technology and the design of Charter. I had really misunderstood the technology. The technology did suggest something to me  but it did not force my hand  and I think this happens very often. You know  engineers are very smart  and despite occasional frustrations because I'm less smart  I've always enjoyed working with them and learning from them. Apropos  in the mid '  s  I started talking to Microsoft about screen fonts. Up to that point  all the fonts on screen had been adapted from previously existing printing fonts  of course. But Microsoft foresaw correctly the movement  the stampede towards electronic communication  to reading and writing onscreen with the printed output as being sort of secondary in importance. So the priorities were just tipping at that point. They wanted a small core set of fonts that were not adapted but designed for the screen to face up to the problems of screen  which were their coarse resolution displays. I said to Microsoft  a typeface designed for a particular technology is a self obsoleting typeface. I've designed too many faces in the past that were intended to mitigate technical problems. Thanks to the engineers  the technical problems went away. So did my typeface. It was only a stopgap. Microsoft came back to say that affordable computer monitors with better resolutions were at least a decade away. So I thought  well  a decade  that's not bad  that's more than a stopgap. So I was persuaded  I was convinced  and we went to work on what became Verdana and Georgia  for the first time working not on paper but directly onto the screen from the pixel up. At that time  screens were binary. The pixel was either on or it was off. Here you see the outline of a letter  the cap H  which is the thin black line  the contour  which is how it is stored in memory  superimposed on the bitmap  which is the grey area  which is how it's displayed on the screen. The bitmap is rasterized from the outline. Here in a cap H  which is all straight lines  the two are in almost perfect sync on the Cartesian grid. Not so with an O. This looks more like bricklaying than type design  but believe me  this is a good bitmap O  for the simple reason that it's symmetrical in both x and y axes. In a binary bitmap  you actually can't ask for more than that. I would sometimes make  I don't know  three or four different versions of a difficult letter like a lowercase A  and then stand back to choose which was the best. Well  there was no best  so the designer's judgment comes in in trying to decide which is the least bad. Is that a compromise  Not to me  if you are working at the highest standard the technology will allow  although that standard may be well short of the ideal. You may be able to see on this slide two different bitmap fonts there. The  a  in the upper one  I think  is better than the  a  in the lower one  but it still ain't great. You can maybe see the effect better if it's reduced. Well  maybe not. So I'm a pragmatist  not an idealist  out of necessity. For a certain kind of temperament  there is a certain kind of satisfaction in doing something that cannot be perfect but can still be done to the best of your ability. Here's the lowercase H from Georgia Italic. The bitmap looks jagged and rough. It is jagged and rough. But I discovered  by experiment  that there is an optimum slant for an italic on a screen so the strokes break well at the pixel boundaries. Look in this example how  rough as it is  how the left and right legs actually break at the same level. That's a victory. That's good  right there. And of course  at the lower depths  you don't get much choice. This is an S  in case you were wondering. Well  it's been    years now since Verdana and Georgia were released. Microsoft were absolutely right  it took a good    years  but screen displays now do have improved spatial resolution  and very much improved photometric resolution thanks to anti aliasing and so on. So now that their mission is accomplished  has that meant the demise of the screen fonts that I designed for coarser displays back then  Will they outlive the now obsolete screens and the flood of new web fonts coming on to the market  Or have they established their own sort of evolutionary niche that is independent of technology  In other words  have they been absorbed into the typographic mainstream  I'm not sure  but they've had a good run so far. Hey     is a good age for anything with present day rates of attrition  so I'm not complaining. Thank you. I feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the Museum of Modern Art on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray. I learned so much from her. After the curator Robert Storr selected all the paintings from her lifetime body of work  I loved looking at the paintings from the     s. There were some motifs and elements that would come up again later in her life. I remember asking her what she thought of those early works. If you didn't know they were hers  you might not have been able to guess. She told me that a few didn't quite meet her own mark for what she wanted them to be. One of the works  in fact  so didn't meet her mark  she had set it out in the trash in her studio  and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value. In that moment  my view of success and creativity changed. I realized that success is a moment  but what we're always celebrating is creativity and mastery. But this is the thing  What gets us to convert success into mastery  This is a question I've long asked myself. I think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win. I started to understand this when I went on one cold May day to watch a set of varsity archers  all women as fate would have it  at the northern tip of Manhattan at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex. I wanted to see what's called archer's paradox  the idea that in order to actually hit your target  you have to aim at something slightly skew from it. I stood and watched as the coach drove up these women in this gray van  and they exited with this kind of relaxed focus. One held a half eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching. And they passed me and smiled  but they sized me up as they made their way to the turf  and spoke to each other not with words but with numbers  degrees  I thought  positions for how they might plan to hit their target. I stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support  and watched her  and I didn't understand how even one was going to hit the ten ring. The ten ring from the standard    yard distance  it looks as small as a matchstick tip held out at arm's length. And this is while holding    pounds of draw weight on each shot. She first hit a seven  I remember  and then a nine  and then two tens  and then the next arrow didn't even hit the target. And I saw that gave her more tenacity  and she went after it again and again. For three hours this went on. At the end of the practice  one of the archers was so taxed that she lied out on the ground just star fished  her head looking up at the sky  trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call that still point of the turning world. It's so rare in American culture  there's so little that's vocational about it anymore  to look at what doggedness looks like with this level of exactitude  what it means to align your body posture for three hours in order to hit a target  pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity. But I stayed because I realized I was witnessing what's so rare to glimpse  that difference between success and mastery. So success is hitting that ten ring  but mastery is knowing that it means nothing if you can't do it again and again. Mastery is not just the same as excellence  though. It's not the same as success  which I see as an event  a moment in time  and a label that the world confers upon you. Mastery is not a commitment to a goal but to a constant pursuit. What gets us to do this  what get us to forward thrust more is to value the near win. How many times have we designated something a classic  a masterpiece even  while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished  riddled with difficulties and flaws  in other words  a near win  Elizabeth Murray surprised me with her admission about her earlier paintings. Painter Paul C zanne so often thought his works were incomplete that he would deliberately leave them aside with the intention of picking them back up again  but at the end of his life  the result was that he had only signed    percent of his paintings. His favorite novel was  The  Unknown  Masterpiece  by Honor  de Balzac  and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself. Franz Kafka saw incompletion when others would find only works to praise  so much so that he wanted all of his diaries  manuscripts  letters and even sketches burned upon his death. His friend refused to honor the request  and because of that  we now have all the works we now do by Kafka   America    The Trial  and  The Castle   a work so incomplete it even stops mid sentence. The pursuit of mastery  in other words  is an ever onward almost.  Lord  grant that I desire more than I can accomplish   Michelangelo implored  as if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel  and he himself was that Adam with his finger outstretched and not quite touching that God's hand. Mastery is in the reaching  not the arriving. It's in constantly wanting to close that gap between where you are and where you want to be. Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft and not for the sake of crafting your career. How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon  We see it even in the life of the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders  who tells me that his triumphs are not merely the result of a grand achievement  but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins. We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge. It's a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington  who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire was always the next one  always the one he had yet to compose. Part of the reason that the near win is inbuilt to mastery is because the greater our proficiency  the more clearly we might see that we don't know all that we thought we did. It's called the Dunning Kruger effect. The Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin when they asked him   What do you think increases with knowledge   and he said   You learn how little you know.  Success motivates us  but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest. One of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between Olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition. Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell studied this difference and found that the frustration silver medalists feel compared to bronze  who are typically a bit more happy to have just not received fourth place and not medaled at all  gives silver medalists a focus on follow up competition. We see it even in the gambling industry that once picked up on this phenomenon of the near win and created these scratch off tickets that had a higher than average rate of near wins and so compelled people to buy more tickets that they were called heart stoppers  and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses in Britain in the     s. The reason the near win has a propulsion is because it changes our view of the landscape and puts our goals  which we tend to put at a distance  into more proximate vicinity to where we stand. If I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week  you might describe it in more general terms. But if I ask you to describe a great day at TED tomorrow  you might describe it with granular  practical clarity. And this is what a near win does. It gets us to focus on what  right now  we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights. It's Jackie Joyner Kersee  who in      missed taking the gold in the heptathlon by one third of a second  and her husband predicted that would give her the tenacity she needed in follow up competition. In       she won the gold in the heptathlon and set a record of       points  a score that no athlete has come very close to since. We thrive not when we've done it all  but when we still have more to do. I stand here thinking and wondering about all the different ways that we might even manufacture a near win in this room  how your lives might play this out  because I think on some gut level we do know this. We know that we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge  and it's why the deliberate incomplete is inbuilt into creation myths. In Navajo culture  some craftsmen and women would deliberately put an imperfection in textiles and ceramics. It's what's called a spirit line  a deliberate flaw in the pattern to give the weaver or maker a way out  but also a reason to continue making work. Masters are not experts because they take a subject to its conceptual end. They're masters because they realize that there isn't one. Now it occurred to me  as I thought about this  why the archery coach told me at the end of that practice  out of earshot of his archers  that he and his colleagues never feel they can do enough for their team  never feel there are enough visualization techniques and posture drills to help them overcome those constant near wins. It didn't sound like a complaint  exactly  but just a way to let me know  a kind of tender admission  to remind me that he knew he was giving himself over to a voracious  unfinished path that always required more. We build out of the unfinished idea  even if that idea is our former self. This is the dynamic of mastery. Coming close to what you thought you wanted can help you attain more than you ever dreamed you could. It's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray was thinking when I saw her smiling at those early paintings one day in the galleries. Even if we created utopias  I believe we would still have the incomplete. Completion is a goal  but we hope it is never the end. Thank you. Wow  this is bright. It must use a lot of power. Well  flying you all in here must have cost a bit of energy too. So the whole planet needs a lot of energy  and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel. We've been burning gas. It's been a good run. It got us to where we are  but we have to stop. We can't do that anymore. So we are trying different types of energy now  alternative energy  but it proved quite difficult to find something that's as convenient and as cost effective as oil  gas and coal. My personal favorite is nuclear energy. Now  it's very energy dense  it produces solid  reliable power  and it doesn't make any CO . Now we know of two ways of making nuclear energy  fission and fusion. Now in fission  you take a big nucleus  you break it in part  in two  and it makes lots of energy  and this is how the nuclear reactor today works. It works pretty good. And then there's fusion. Now  I like fusion. Fusion's much better. So you take two small nuclei  you put it together  and you make helium  and that's very nice. It makes lots of energy. This is nature's way of producing energy. The sun and all the stars in the universe run on fusion. Now  a fusion plant would actually be quite cost effective and it also would be quite safe. It only produces short term radioactive waste  and it cannot melt down. Now  the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean. In the ocean  you can extract the fuel for about one thousandth of a cent per kilowatt hour  so that's very  very cheap. And if the whole planet would run on fusion  we could extract the fuel from the ocean. It would run for billions and billions of years. Now  if fusion is so great  why don't we have it  Where is it  Well  there's always a bit of a catch. Fusion is really  really hard to do. So the problem is  those two nuclei  they are both positively charged  so they don't want to fuse. They go like this. They go like that. So in order to make them fuse  you have to throw them at each other with great speed  and if they have enough speed  they will go against the repulsion  they will touch  and they will make energy. Now  the particle speed is a measure of the temperature. So the temperature required for fusion is     billion degrees C. This is rather warm  and this is why fusion is so hard to do. Now  I caught my little fusion bug when I did my Ph.D. here at the University of British Columbia  and then I got a big job in a laser printer place making printing for the printing industry. I worked there for    years  and I got a little bit bored  and then I was     and I got a mid life crisis  you know  the usual thing  Who am I  What should I do  What should I do  What can I do  And then I was looking at my good work  and what I was doing is I was cutting the forests around here in B.C. and burying you  all of you  in millions of tons of junk mail. Now  that was not very satisfactory. So some people buy a Porsche. Others get a mistress. But I've decided to get my bit to solve global warming and make fusion happen. Now  so the first thing I did is I looked into the literature and I see  how does fusion work  So the physicists have been working on fusion for a while  and one of the ways they do it is with something called a tokamak. It's a big ring of magnetic coil  superconducting coil  and it makes a magnetic field in a ring like this  and the hot gas in the middle  which is called a plasma  is trapped. The particles go round and round and round the circle at the wall. Then they throw a huge amount of heat in there to try to cook that to fusion temperature. So this is the inside of one of those donuts  and on the right side you can see the fusion plasma in there. Now  a second way of doing this is by using laser fusion. Now in laser fusion  you have a little ping pong ball  you put the fusion fuel in the center  and you zap that with a whole bunch of laser around it. The lasers are very strong  and it squashes the ping pong ball really  really quick. And if you squeeze something hard enough  it gets hotter  and if it gets really  really fast  and they do that in one billionth of a second  it makes enough energy and enough heat to make fusion. So this is the inside of one such machine. You see the laser beam and the pellet in the center. Now  most people think that fusion is going nowhere. They always think that the physicists are in their lab and they're working hard  but nothing is happening. That's actually not quite true. This is a curve of the gain in fusion over the last    years or so  and you can see that we're making now about        times more fusion than we used to when we started. That's a pretty good gain. As a matter of fact  it's as fast as the fabled Moore's Law that defined the amount of transistors they can put on a chip. Now  this dot here is called JET  the Joint European Torus. It's a big tokamak donut in Europe  and this machine in      produced    megawatts of fusion power with    megawatts of heat. Now  you say  that's not much use  but it's actually pretty close  considering we can get about        times more than we started. The second dot here is the NIF. It's the National Ignition Facility. It's a big laser machine in the U.S.  and last month they announced with quite a bit of noise that they had managed to make more fusion energy from the fusion than the energy that they put in  the center of the ping pong ball. Now  that's not quite good enough  because the laser to put that energy in was more energy than that  but it was pretty good. Now this is ITER  pronounced in French  EE tairh. So this is a big collaboration of different countries that are building a huge magnetic donut in the south of France  and this machine  when it's finished  will produce     megawatts of fusion power with only    megawatts to make it. So this one is the real one. It's going to work. That's the kind of machine that makes energy. Now if you look at the graph  you will notice that those two dots are a little bit on the right of the curve. We kind of have fallen off the progress. Actually  the science to make those machines was really in time to produce fusion during that curve. However  there has been a bit of politics going on  and the will to do it was not there  so it drifted to the right. ITER  for example  could have been built in      or       but because it's a big international collaboration  the politics got in and it delayed it a bit. For example  it took them about three years to decide where to put it. Now  fusion is often criticized for being a little too expensive. Yes  it did cost a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year to make this progress. But you have to compare that to the cost of making Moore's Law. That cost way more than that. The result of Moore's Law is this cell phone here in my pocket. This cell phone  and the Internet behind it  cost about one trillion dollars  just so I can take a selfie and put it on Facebook. Then when my dad sees that  he'll be very proud. We also spend about     billion dollars a year in subsidies for oil and gas and renewable energy. Now  we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion. So me  personally  I don't think it's too expensive. I think it's actually been shortchanged  considering it can solve all our energy problems cleanly for the next couple of billions of years. Now I can say that  but I'm a little bit biased  because I started a fusion company and I don't even have a Facebook account. So when I started this fusion company in       I knew I couldn't fight with the big lads. They had much more resources than me. So I decided I would need to find a solution that is cheaper and faster. Now magnetic and laser fusion are pretty good machines. They are awesome pieces of technology  wonderful machines  and they have shown that fusion can be done. However  as a power plant  I don't think they're very good. They're way too big  way too complicated  way too expensive  and also  they don't deal very much with the fusion energy. When you make fusion  the energy comes out as neutrons  fast neutrons comes out of the plasma. Those neutrons hit the wall of the machine. It damages it. And also  you have to catch the heat from those neutrons and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere  and on those machines  it was all a bit of an afterthought. So I decided that surely there is a better way of doing that. So back to the literature  and I read about the fusion everywhere. One way in particular attracted my attention  and it's called magnetized target fusion  or MTF for short. Now  in MTF  what you want to do is you take a big vat and you fill that with liquid metal  and you spin the liquid metal to open a vortex in the center  a bit like your sink. When you pull the plug on a sink  it makes a vortex. And then you have some pistons driven by pressure that goes on the outside  and this compresses the liquid metal around the plasma  and it compresses it  it gets hotter  like a laser  and then it makes fusion. So it's a bit of a mix between a magnetized fusion and the laser fusion. So those have a couple of very good advantages. The liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons and no neutrons hit the wall  and therefore there's no damage to the machine. The liquid metal gets hot  so you can pump that in a heat exchanger  make some steam  spin a turbine. So that's a very convenient way of doing this part of the process. And finally  all the energy to make the fusion happen comes from steam powered pistons  which is way cheaper than lasers or superconducting coils. Now  this was all very good except for the problem that it didn't quite work. There's always a catch. So when you compress that  the plasma cools down faster than the compression speed  so you're trying to compress it  but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down and then it did absolutely nothing. So when I saw that  I said  well  this is such a shame  because it's a very  very good idea. So hopefully I can improve on that. So I thought about it for a minute  and I said  okay  how can we make that work better  So then I thought about impact. What about if we use a big hammer and we swing it and we hit the nail like this  in the place of putting the hammer on the nail and pushing and try to put it in  That won't work. So what the idea is is to use the idea of an impact. So we accelerate the pistons with steam  that takes a little bit of time  but then  bang  you hit the piston  and  baff   all the energy is done instantly  down instantly to the liquid  and that compresses the plasma much faster. So I decided  okay  this is good  let's make that. So we built this machine in this garage here. We made a small machine that we managed to squeeze a little bit of neutrons out of that  and those are my marketing neutrons  and with those marketing neutrons  then I raised about    million dollars  and I hired    people. That's my team here. And this is what we want to build. So it's going to be a big machine  about three meters in diameter  liquid lead spinning around  big vortex in the center  put the plasma on the top and on the bottom  piston hits on the side  bang   it compresses it  and it will make some energy  and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal  going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine  and some of the steam will go back to fire the piston. We're going to run that about one time per second  and it will produce     megawatts of electricity. Okay  we also built this injector  so this injector makes the plasma to start with. It makes the plasma at about a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C. Unfortunately  it doesn't last quite long enough  so we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit  but last month it got a lot better  so I think we have the plasma compressing now. Then we built a small sphere  about this big     pistons around it  and this will compress the liquid. However  plasma is difficult to compress. When you compress it  it tends to go a little bit crooked like that  so you need the timing of the piston to be very good  and for that we use several control systems  which was not possible in       but we now can do that with nice  new electronics. So finally  most people think that fusion is in the future and will never happen  but as a matter of fact  fusion is getting very close. We are almost there. The big labs have shown that fusion is doable  and now there are small companies that are thinking about that  and they say  it's not that it cannot be done  but it's how to make it cost effectively. General Fusion is one of those small companies  and hopefully  very soon  somebody  someone  will crack that nut  and perhaps it will be General Fusion. Thank you very much. Scientific breakthrough  the kind that can potentially save lives  can sometimes be lying right out in the open for us to discover  in the evolved  accumulated body of human anecdote  for example  or in the time tested adaptations that we observe in the natural world around us. Science starts with observation  but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence  isolate them  and test them with scientific rigor. And when we do  the results will often surprise. Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years  unfortunately and tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a    month period during that time. But Western Australia is not alone in this. The incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide. And so it's not surprising  perhaps  that in July of this year  Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide  and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see. And I have for you today the story of that journey  but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention. When we began this process  we were looking  it was about three years ago  and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in Western Australia  and by chance  in a previous role  I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler. Now Harry Butler  who most Australians would know is a famous naturalist  had spent a lot of time in the marine environment. Harry Butler is a precursor  if you like  to the late Steve Irwin. When I asked him about what the solution to the problem might be  the answer was quite surprising. He said   Take a black wetsuit  band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee  and you'll be mimicking the warning systems of most marine species.  I didn't think about that much at the time  and it wasn't until the next three fatal shark attacks happened  and it caused me to think  maybe there's some merit to this idea. And I turned to the web to see if there might be some clues. And it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking. So biologically  there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns  warning patterns  to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked  not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark. On the human side  Walter Starck  an oceanographer  has been painting his wetsuit since the     s  and anthropologically  Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands in a sea snake ceremony to ward off the shark god. So what's going on here  Is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to consider and define  We know that sharks use a range of sensors when they engage  particularly for attack  but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target  and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack. It makes sense to pay attention to the biological anecdote because that's time tested evolution over many millennia. But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts  the idea that there's a kernel of truth thought to be important  passed down from generation to generation  so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior  I wanted to test this idea. I wanted to put some science to this anecdotal evidence  because if science could support this concept  then we might have at least part of the solution to shark attack right under our very nose. To do that  I needed some experts in shark vision and shark neurology  and a worldwide search  again  led to the University of W.A. on the doorstep here  with the Oceans Institute. And professor Nathan Hart and his team had just written a paper which tells us  confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white  or grayscale. So I called up Nathan  a little bit sheepishly  actually  about this idea that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes to produce a wetsuit to try and mitigate the risk of shark attack  and fortunately  he thought that was a good idea. So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the West Australian State Government. And we did three key things. The first is that we mapped the characteristics  the physical characteristics of the eyes of the three main predatory sharks  so the great white  tiger and bull shark. We did that genetically and we did that anatomically. The next thing we did was to understand  using complex computer modeling  what that eye can see at different depths  distances  light conditions  and water clarity in the ocean. And from there  we were able to pinpoint two key characteristics  what patterns and shapes would present the wearer as hidden or hard to make out in the water  cryptic  and what patterns and shapes might provide the greatest contrast but provide the greatest breakup of profile so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey or shark food. The next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear  and to that end  I invited Ray Smith  a surfer  industrial designer  wetsuit designer  and in fact the guy that designed the original Quiksilver logo  to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear. And here's an example of one of the first drawings. So this is what I call a  don't eat me  wetsuit. So this takes that banding idea  takes that banding idea  it's highly visible  provides a highly disruptive profile  and is intended to prevent the shark from considering that you would be ordinary food  and potentially even create confusion for the shark. And this one's configured to go with a surfboard. You can see that dark  opaque panel on the front  and it's particularly better for the surface  where being backlit and providing a silhouette is problematic. Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit  or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column. There are three panels on this suit  and in any given conditions  one or more of those panels will match the reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially  leaving the last panel or panels to create a disruptive profile in the water column. And this one's particularly well suited to the dive configuration  so when you're deeper under the water. So we knew that we had some really solid science here. We knew  if you wanted to stand out  you needed to look stripy  and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic  you needed to look like this. But the acid test is always going to be  how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes. And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think. So we have to bait the rig  because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence  and by baiting the rig  we're obviously changing shark behavior. We can't put humans in the water. We're ethically precluded from even using humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water. But nevertheless  we started the testing process in January of this year  initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks. The way we did that was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait  wrap it in a neoprene skin  and then run two stereo underwater cameras to watch how the shark actually engages with that rig. And because we use stereo  we can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is  what angle it comes in at  how quickly it leaves  and what its behavior is in an empirical rather than a subjective way. Because we needed to preserve the scientific method  we ran a control rig which was a black neoprene rig just like a normal black wetsuit against the  what we call  SAMS technology rig. And the results were not just exciting  but very encouraging  and today I would like to just give you a snapshot of two of those engagements. So here we've got a four meter tiger shark engaging the black control rig  which it had encountered about a minute and a half before. Now that exact same shark had engaged  or encountered this SAMS rig  which is the Elude SAMS rig  about eight minutes before  and spent six minutes circling it  hunting for it  looking for what it could smell and sense but not see  and this was the final engagement. Great white sharks are more confident than the tigers  and here you see great white shark engaging a control rig  so a black neoprene wetsuit  and going straight to the bottom  coming up and engaging. In contrast to the SAMS technology rig  this is the banded one  where it's more tactile  it's more investigative  it's more apprehensive  and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go. So  it's important for us that all  the testing is done independently  and the University of W.A. is doing the testing. It'll be an ongoing process. It's subject to peer review and subject to publication. It's so important that this concept is led with the science. From the perspective of Shark  Attack Mitigation Systems  we're a biotechnology licensing company  so we don't make wetsuits ourselves. We'll license others to do that. But I thought you might be interested in seeing what SAMS technology looks like embedded in a wetsuit  and to that end  for the first time  live  worldwide    I can show you what biological adaptation  science and design looks like in real life. So I can welcome Sam  the surfer  from this side. Where are you  Sam  And Eduardo. Cheers  mate. Cheers. Thanks  gentlemen.  Applause  So what have we done here  Well  to my mind  rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention  we've paid attention to the biological evidence  we've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence  and we've used science as a tool for translation  translation of something that was already there into something that we can  use for the benefit of mankind. And it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention is one that we can apply much more widely than this in the pursuit of innovation. After all  did the Wright brothers discover manned flight  or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically  replicate it in a way that humans could use  As for the humble wetsuit  who knows what oceanwear will look like in two years' time  in five years' time or in    years' time  but with this new thinking  I'm guessing there's a fair chance it won't be pure black. Thank you. A computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression  but for the most part  that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones. And I'd like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live. A few years ago  I got a call from a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York  and the next thing I knew  I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays. This one's called  The Chase.  There are two pairs of shoes  a man's pair and a woman's pair  and they play out this slow  tense chase around the window in which the man scoots up behind the woman and gets in her personal space  and then she moves away. Each of the shoes has magnets in it  and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes around. My friend Andy Cavatorta was building a robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour and I wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play music. The harp has four separate pendulums  and each pendulum has    strings  so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes  and the harps are all networked together so that they can play the right notes at the right time in the music. I built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago  and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to happen. And the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit  and a researcher from a science education center in Australia decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on. And she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit  and were helping people learn in a social way. And when you think about it  this makes a lot of sense  that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily. I mean  our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects. Think about which you find easier to use  a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone  But the thing that struck me about all of these different projects is that they really had to be built from scratch  down to the level of the electronics and the printed circuit boards and all the mechanisms all the way up to the software. I wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building something from scratch every single time. So my first attempt at this was at the MIT Media Lab with Professor Hiroshi Ishii  and we built this array of     different electromagnets  and together they were able to move objects around on top of their surface. But the problem with this was that these magnets cost over        dollars. Although each one was pretty small  altogether they weighed so much that the table that they were on started to sag. So I wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on any tabletop surface. So to explore this idea  I built an army of small robots  and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels. They're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions  and when you couple these robots with a video projector  you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information. So here's an example of what I mean. This is a video editing application where all of the controls for manipulating the video are physical. So if we want to tweak the color  we just enter the color mode  and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color  or if we want to adjust the audio  then we get two different dials for that  these physical objects. So here the left and right channel stay in sync  but if we want to  we can override that by grabbing both of them at the same time. So the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that's designed in software. And this is a mapping application for disaster response. So you have these physical objects that represent police  fire and rescue  and a dispatcher can grab them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go  and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world. This is a video chat application. It's amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object. With this interface  we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and arcade games  where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible. But one of the areas that I'm most excited about using this platform for is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to solve alone. One example of those is protein folding. So here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein  and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways. And if we move it in a way that doesn't really make sense with the underlying molecular simulation  we get this physical feedback where we can actually feel these physical handles pulling back against us. So feeling what's going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction. So we're just beginning to explore what's possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment. Maybe this is the computer of the future. There's no touchscreen. There's no technology visible at all. But when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk  the objects on the table come alive. Thank you. So  a few years ago I was at JFK Airport about to get on a flight  when I was approached by two women who I do not think would be insulted to hear themselves described as tiny old tough talking Italian American broads. The taller one  who is like up here  she comes marching up to me  and she goes   Honey  I gotta ask you something. You got something to do with that whole 'Eat  Pray  Love' thing that's been going on lately   And I said   Yes  I did.  And she smacks her friend and she goes   See  I told you  I said  that's that girl. That's that girl who wrote that book based on that movie.  So that's who I am. And believe me  I'm extremely grateful to be that person  because that whole  Eat  Pray  Love  thing was a huge break for me. But it also left me in a really tricky position moving forward as an author trying to figure out how in the world I was ever going to write a book again that would ever please anybody  because I knew well in advance that all of those people who had adored  Eat  Pray  Love  were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever I wrote next because it wasn't going to be  Eat  Pray  Love   and all of those people who had hated  Eat  Pray  Love  were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever I wrote next because it would provide evidence that I still lived. So I knew that I had no way to win  and knowing that I had no way to win made me seriously consider for a while just quitting the game and moving to the country to raise corgis. But if I had done that  if I had given up writing  I would have lost my beloved vocation  so I knew that the task was that I had to find some way to gin up the inspiration to write the next book regardless of its inevitable negative outcome. In other words  I had to find a way to make sure that my creativity survived its own success. And I did  in the end  find that inspiration  but I found it in the most unlikely and unexpected place. I found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life about how creativity can survive its own failure. So just to back up and explain  the only thing I have ever wanted to be for my whole life was a writer. I wrote all through childhood  all through adolescence  by the time I was a teenager I was sending my very bad stories to The New Yorker  hoping to be discovered. After college  I got a job as a diner waitress  kept working  kept writing  kept trying really hard to get published  and failing at it. I failed at getting published for almost six years. So for almost six years  every single day  I had nothing but rejection letters waiting for me in my mailbox. And it was devastating every single time  and every single time  I had to ask myself if I should just quit while I was behind and give up and spare myself this pain. But then I would find my resolve  and always in the same way  by saying   I'm not going to quit  I'm going home.  And you have to understand that for me  going home did not mean returning to my family's farm. For me  going home meant returning to the work of writing because writing was my home  because I loved writing more than I hated failing at writing  which is to say that I loved writing more than I loved my own ego  which is ultimately to say that I loved writing more than I loved myself. And that's how I pushed through it. But the weird thing is that    years later  during the crazy ride of  Eat  Pray  Love   I found myself identifying all over again with that unpublished young diner waitress who I used to be  thinking about her constantly  and feeling like I was her again  which made no rational sense whatsoever because our lives could not have been more different. She had failed constantly. I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation. We had nothing in common. Why did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again  And it was only when I was trying to unthread that that I finally began to comprehend the strange and unlikely psychological connection in our lives between the way we experience great failure and the way we experience great success. So think of it like this  For most of your life  you live out your existence here in the middle of the chain of human experience where everything is normal and reassuring and regular  but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here into the blinding darkness of disappointment. Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far way out over here into the equally blinding glare of fame and recognition and praise. And one of these fates is objectively seen by the world as bad  and the other one is objectively seen by the world as good  but your subconscious is completely incapable of discerning the difference between bad and good. The only thing that it is capable of feeling is the absolute value of this emotional equation  the exact distance that you have been flung from yourself. And there's a real equal danger in both cases of getting lost out there in the hinterlands of the psyche. But in both cases  it turns out that there is also the same remedy for self restoration  and that is that you have got to find your way back home again as swiftly and smoothly as you can  and if you're wondering what your home is  here's a hint  Your home is whatever in this world you love more than you love yourself. So that might be creativity  it might be family  it might be invention  adventure  faith  service  it might be raising corgis  I don't know  your home is that thing to which you can dedicate your energies with such singular devotion that the ultimate results become inconsequential. For me  that home has always been writing. So after the weird  disorienting success that I went through with  Eat  Pray  Love   I realized that all I had to do was exactly the same thing that I used to have to do all the time when I was an equally disoriented failure. I had to get my ass back to work  and that's what I did  and that's how  in       I was able to publish the dreaded follow up to  Eat  Pray  Love.  And you know what happened with that book  It bombed  and I was fine. Actually  I kind of felt bulletproof  because I knew that I had broken the spell and I had found my way back home to writing for the sheer devotion of it. And I stayed in my home of writing after that  and I wrote another book that just came out last year and that one was really beautifully received  which is very nice  but not my point. My point is that I'm writing another one now  and I'll write another book after that and another and another and another and many of them will fail  and some of them might succeed  but I will always be safe from the random hurricanes of outcome as long as I never forget where I rightfully live. Look  I don't know where you rightfully live  but I know that there's something in this world that you love more than you love yourself. Something worthy  by the way  so addiction and infatuation don't count  because we all know that those are not safe places to live. Right  The only trick is that you've got to identify the best  worthiest thing that you love most  and then build your house right on top of it and don't budge from it. And if you should someday  somehow get vaulted out of your home by either great failure or great success  then your job is to fight your way back to that home the only way that it has ever been done  by putting your head down and performing with diligence and devotion and respect and reverence whatever the task is that love is calling forth from you next. You just do that  and keep doing that again and again and again  and I can absolutely promise you  from long personal experience in every direction  I can assure you that it's all going to be okay. Thank you.  Why    Why   is a question that parents ask me all the time.  Why did my child develop autism   As a pediatrician  as a geneticist  as a researcher  we try and address that question. But autism is not a single condition. It's actually a spectrum of disorders  a spectrum that ranges  for instance  from Justin  a    year old boy who's not verbal  who can't speak  who communicates by using an iPad to touch pictures to communicate his thoughts and his concerns  a little boy who  when he gets upset  will start rocking  and eventually  when he's disturbed enough  will bang his head to the point that he can actually cut it open and require stitches. That same diagnosis of autism  though  also applies to Gabriel  another    year old boy who has quite a different set of challenges. He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics. He can multiple three numbers by three numbers in his head with ease  yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation  he has great difficulty. He doesn't make eye contact. He has difficulty starting a conversation  feels awkward  and when he gets nervous  he actually shuts down. Yet both of these boys have the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. One of the things that concerns us is whether or not there really is an epidemic of autism. These days  one in    children will be diagnosed with autism  and the question is  why does this graph look this way  Has that number been increasing dramatically over time  Or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism  simply giving them a diagnosis when they were still present there before yet simply didn't have that label  And in fact  in the late     s  the early     s  legislation was passed that actually provided individuals with autism with resources  with access to educational materials that would help them. With that increased awareness  more parents  more pediatricians  more educators learned to recognize the features of autism. As a result of that  more individuals were diagnosed and got access to the resources they needed. In addition  we've changed our definition over time  so in fact we've widened the definition of autism  and that accounts for some of the increased prevalence that we see. The next question everyone wonders is  what caused autism  And a common misconception is that vaccines cause autism. But let me be very clear  Vaccines do not cause autism. In fact  the original research study that suggested that was the case was completely fraudulent. It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet  in which it was published  and that author  a physician  had his medical license taken away from him. The Institute of Medicine  The Centers for Disease Control  have repeatedly investigated this and there is no credible evidence that vaccines cause autism. Furthermore  one of the ingredients in vaccines  something called thimerosal  was thought to be what the cause of autism was. That was actually removed from vaccines in the year       and you can see that it really did not have an effect in what happened with the prevalence of autism. So again  there is no evidence that this is the answer. So the question remains  what does cause autism  In fact  there's probably not one single answer. Just as autism is a spectrum  there's a spectrum of etiologies  a spectrum of causes. Based on epidemiological data  we know that one of the causes  or one of the associations  I should say  is advanced paternal age  that is  increasing age of the father at the time of conception. In addition  another vulnerable and critical period in terms of development is when the mother is pregnant. During that period  while the fetal brain is developing  we know that exposure to certain agents can actually increase the risk of autism. In particular  there's a medication  valproic acid  which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take  we know can increase that risk of autism. In addition  there can be some infectious agents that can also cause autism. And one of the things I'm going to spend a lot of time focusing on are the genes that can cause autism. I'm focusing on this not because genes are the only cause of autism  but it's a cause of autism that we can readily define and be able to better understand the biology and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with strategies to be able to intervene. One of the genetic factors that we don't understand  however  is the difference that we see in terms of males and females. Males are affected four to one compared to females with autism  and we really don't understand what that cause is. One of the ways that we can understand that genetics is a factor is by looking at something called the concordance rate. In other words  if one sibling has autism  what's the probability that another sibling in that family will have autism  And we can look in particular at three types of siblings  identical twins  twins that actually share     percent of their genetic information and shared the same intrauterine environment  versus fraternal twins  twins that actually share    percent of their genetic information  versus regular siblings  brother sister  sister sister  also sharing    percent of their genetic information  yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment. And when you look at those concordance ratios  one of the striking things that you will see is that in identical twins  that concordance rate is    percent. Remarkably  though  it's not     percent. It is not that genes account for all of the risk for autism  but yet they account for a lot of that risk  because when you look at fraternal twins  that concordance rate is only    percent. On the other hand  there is a difference between those fraternal twins and the siblings  suggesting that there are common exposures for those fraternal twins that may not be shared as commonly with siblings alone. So this provides some of the data that autism is genetic. Well  how genetic is it  When we compare it to other conditions that we're familiar with  things like cancer  heart disease  diabetes  in fact  genetics plays a much larger role in autism than it does in any of these other conditions. But with this  that doesn't tell us what the genes are. It doesn't even tell us in any one child  is it one gene or potentially a combination of genes  And so in fact  in some individuals with autism  it is genetic  That is  that it is one single  powerful  deterministic gene that causes the autism. However  in other individuals  it's genetic  that is  that it's actually a combination of genes in part with the developmental process that ultimately determines that risk for autism. We don't know in any one person  necessarily  which of those two answers it is until we start digging deeper. So the question becomes  how can we start to identify what exactly those genes are. And let me pose something that might not be intuitive. In certain individuals  they can have autism for a reason that is genetic but yet not because of autism running in the family. And the reason is because in certain individuals  they can actually have genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father  but actually start brand new in them  mutations that are present in the egg or the sperm at the time of conception but have not been passed down generation through generation within the family. And we can actually use that strategy to now understand and to identify those genes causing autism in those individuals. So in fact  at the Simons Foundation  we took       individuals that had no family history of autism  and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes causing autism in those cases  To do that  we actually had to comprehensively be able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those differences were between the mother  the father and the child. In doing so  I apologize  I'm going to use an outdated analogy of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia  but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inventory  we needed to be able to look at massive amounts of information. Our genetic information is organized into a set of    volumes  and when we did that  we had to be able to account for each of those    volumes  because in some cases with autism  there's actually a single volume that's missing. We had to get more granular than that  though  and so we had to start opening those books  and in some cases  the genetic change was more subtle. It might have been a single paragraph that was missing  or yet  even more subtle than that  a single letter  one out of three billion letters that was changed  that was altered  yet had profound effects in terms of how the brain functions and affects behavior. In doing this within these families  we were able to account for approximately    percent of the individuals and determine that there was a single powerful genetic factor that caused autism within those families. On the other hand  there's    percent that we still haven't figured out. As we did this  though  it was really quite humbling  because we realized that there was not simply one gene for autism. In fact  the current estimates are that there are     to     different genes that can cause autism. And that explains  in part  why we see such a broad spectrum in terms of its effects. Although there are that many genes  there is some method to the madness. It's not simply random          different genes  but in fact they fit together. They fit together in a pathway. They fit together in a network that's starting to make sense now in terms of how the brain functions. We're starting to have a bottom up approach where we're identifying those genes  those proteins  those molecules  understanding how they interact together to make that neuron work  understanding how those neurons interact together to make circuits work  and understand how those circuits work to now control behavior  and understand that both in individuals with autism as well as individuals who have normal cognition. But early diagnosis is a key for us. Being able to make that diagnosis of someone who's susceptible at a time in a window where we have the ability to transform  to be able to impact that growing  developing brain is critical. And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods to be able to take infants  small babies  and be able to use biomarkers  in this case eye contact and eye tracking  to identify an infant at risk. This particular infant  you can see  making very good eye contact with this woman as she's singing  Itsy  Bitsy Spider   in fact is not going to develop autism. This baby we know is going to be in the clear. On the other hand  this other baby is going to go on to develop autism. In this particular child  you can see  it's not making good eye contact. Instead of the eyes focusing in and having that social connection  looking at the mouth  looking at the nose  looking off in another direction  but not again socially connecting  and being able to do this on a very large scale  screen infants  screen children for autism  through something very robust  very reliable  is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being able to intervene at an early stage when we can have the greatest impact. How are we going to intervene  It's probably going to be a combination of factors. In part  in some individuals  we're going to try and use medications. And so in fact  identifying the genes for autism is important for us to identify drug targets  to identify things that we might be able to impact and can be certain that that's really what we need to do in autism. But that's not going to be the only answer. Beyond just drugs  we're going to use educational strategies. Individuals with autism  some of them are wired a little bit differently. They learn in a different way. They absorb their surroundings in a different way  and we need to be able to educate them in a way that serves them best. Beyond that  there are a lot of individuals in this room who have great ideas in terms of new technologies we can use  everything from devices we can use to train the brain to be able to make it more efficient and to compensate for areas in which it has a little bit of trouble  to even things like Google Glass. You could imagine  for instance  Gabriel  with his social awkwardness  might be able to wear Google Glass with an earpiece in his ear  and have a coach be able to help him  be able to help think about conversations  conversation starters  being able to even perhaps one day invite a girl out on a date. All of these new technologies just offer tremendous opportunities for us to be able to impact the individuals with autism  but yet we have a long way to go. As much as we know  there is so much more that we don't know  and so I invite all of you to be able to help us think about how to do this better  to use as a community our collective wisdom to be able to make a difference  and in particular  for the individuals in families with autism  I invite you to join the interactive autism network  to be part of the solution to this  because it's going to take really a lot of us to think about what's important  what's going to be a meaningful difference. As we think about something that's potentially a solution  how well does it work  Is it something that's really going to make a difference in your lives  as an individual  as a family with autism  We're going to need individuals of all ages  from the young to the old  and with all different shapes and sizes of the autism spectrum disorder to make sure that we can have an impact. So I invite all of you to join the mission and to help to be able to make the lives of individuals with autism so much better and so much richer. Thank you. The Olympic motto is  Citius  Altius  Fortius.  Faster  Higher  Stronger. And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly. The winner of the      Olympic marathon ran two hours and eight minutes. Had he been racing against the winner of the      Olympic marathon  he would have won by nearly an hour and a half. Now we all have this feeling that we're somehow just getting better as a human race  inexorably progressing  but it's not like we've evolved into a new species in a century. So what's going on here  I want to take a look at what's really behind this march of athletic progress. In       Jesse Owens held the world record in the     meters. Had Jesse Owens been racing last year in the world championships of the     meters  when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished  Owens would have still had    feet to go. That's a lot in sprinter land. To give you a sense of how much it is  I want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker. Now picture the stadium last year at the world championships of the     meters  thousands of fans waiting with baited breath to see Usain Bolt  the fastest man in history  flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks. And I want you to pretend that Jesse Owens is in that race. Now close your eyes for a second and picture the race. Bang  The gun goes off. An American sprinter jumps out to the front. Usain Bolt starts to catch him. Usain Bolt passes him  and as the runners come to the finish  you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line. That's the entire finish of the race. You can open your eyes now. That first beep was Usain Bolt. That last beep was Jesse Owens. Listen to it again. When you think of it like that  it's not that big a difference  is it  And then consider that Usain Bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible. Jesse Owens  on the other hand  ran on cinders  the ash from burnt wood  and that soft surface stole far more energy from his legs as he ran. Rather than blocks  Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from. Biomechanical analysis of the speed of Owens' joints shows that had been running on the same surface as Bolt  he wouldn't have been    feet behind  he would have been within one stride. Rather than the last beep  Owens would have been the second beep. Listen to it again. That's the difference track surface technology has made  and it's done it throughout the running world. Consider a longer event. In       Sir Roger Bannister became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile. Nowadays  college kids do that every year. On rare occasions  a high school kid does it. As of the end of last year        men had run under four minutes in the mile  but like Jesse Owens  Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today. So I consulted biomechanics experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders than synthetic tracks  and their consensus that it's one and a half percent slower. So if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion to every man who ran his sub four mile on a synthetic track  this is what happens. Only     are left. If you look at it from that perspective  fewer than ten new men per  year  have joined the sub four mile club since Sir Roger Bannister. Now      is a lot more than one  and that's partly because there are many more people training today and they're training more intelligently. Even college kids are professional in their training compared to Sir Roger Bannister  who trained for    minutes at a time while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school. And that guy who won the      Olympic marathon in three in a half hours  that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy while he ran along the course. That was his idea of a performance enhancing drug. Clearly  athletes have gotten more savvy about performance enhancing drugs as well  and that's made a difference in some sports at some times  but technology has made a difference in all sports  from faster skis to lighter shoes. Take a look at the record for the     meter freestyle swim. The record is always trending downward  but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs. This first cliff  in       is the introduction of the flip turn. Rather than stopping and turning around  athletes could somersault under the water and get going right away in the opposite direction. This second cliff  the introduction of gutters on the side of the pool that allows water to splash off  rather than becoming turbulence that impedes the swimmers as they race. This final cliff  the introduction of full body and low friction swimsuits. Throughout sports  technology has changed the face of performance. In       Eddy Merckx set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at    miles        feet. Now that record improved and improved as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic all the way until       when it was set at    miles        feet  nearly five miles farther than Eddy Merckx cycled in     . But then in       the International Cycling Union decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record had to do so with essentially the same equipment that Eddy Merckx used in     . Where does the record stand today     miles        feet  a grand total of     feet farther than Eddy Merckx cycled more than four decades ago. Essentially the entire improvement in this record was due to technology. Still  technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward. While indeed we haven't evolved into a new species in a century  the gene pool within competitive sports most certainly has changed. In the early half of the   th century  physical education instructors and coaches had the idea that the average body type was the best for all athletic endeavors  medium height  medium weight  no matter the sport. And this showed in athletes' bodies. In the     s  the average elite high jumper and average elite shot putter were the same exact size. But as that idea started to fade away  as sports scientists and coaches realized that rather than the average body type  you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches  a form of artificial selection took place  a self sorting for bodies that fit certain sports  and athletes' bodies became more different from one another. Today  rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper  the average elite shot putter is two and a half inches taller and     pounds heavier. And this happened throughout the sports world. In fact  if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of the   th century  it looks like this. There's some dispersal  but it's kind of grouped around that average body type. Then that idea started to go away  and at the same time  digital technology    first radio  then television and the Internet    gave millions  or in some cases billions  of people a ticket to consume elite sports performance. The financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed  and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance. It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies. And if you plot a data point for these same two dozen sports today  it looks like this. The athletes' bodies have gotten much more different from one another. And because this chart looks like the charts that show the expanding universe  with the galaxies flying away from one another  the scientists who discovered it call it  The Big Bang of Body Types.  In sports where height is prized  like basketball  the tall athletes got taller. In       the National Basketball Association signed a groundbreaking agreement making players partners in the league  entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts. Suddenly  anybody who could be an NBA player wanted to be  and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships. Almost overnight  the proportion of men in the NBA who are at least seven feet tall doubled to    percent. Today  one in    men in the NBA is at least seven feet tall  but a seven foot tall man is incredibly rare in the general population    so rare that if you know an American man between the ages of    and    who is at least seven feet tall  there's a    percent chance he's in the NBA right now. That is  find six honest seven footers  one is in the NBA right now. And that's not the only way that NBA players' bodies are unique. This is Leonardo da Vinci's  Vitruvian Man   the ideal proportions  with arm span equal to height. My arm span is exactly equal to my height. Yours is probably very nearly so. But not the average NBA player. The average NBA player is a shade under  '    with arms that are seven feet long. Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall  they are ludicrously long. Had Leonardo wanted to draw the Vitruvian NBA Player  he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse  not a circle and a square. So in sports where large size is prized  the large athletes have gotten larger. Conversely  in sports where diminutive stature is an advantage  the small athletes got smaller. The average elite female gymnast shrunk from  '   to  '   on average over the last    years  all the better for their power to weight ratio and for spinning in the air. And while the large got larger and the small got smaller  the weird got weirder. The average length of the forearm of a water polo player in relation to their total arm got longer  all the better for a forceful throwing whip. And as the large got larger  small got smaller  and the weird weirder. In swimming  the ideal body type is a long torso and short legs. It's like the long hull of a canoe for speed over the water. And the opposite is advantageous in running. You want long legs and a short torso. And this shows in athletes' bodies today. Here you see Michael Phelps  the greatest swimmer in history  standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj  the world record holder in the mile. These men are seven inches different in height  but because of the body types advantaged in their sports  they wear the same length pants. Seven inches difference in height  these men have the same length legs. Now in some cases  the search for bodies that could push athletic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that weren't previously competing at all  like Kenyan distance runners. We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners. Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe as being great marathoners. The Kalenjin make up just    percent of the Kenyan population but the vast majority of elite runners. And they happen  on average  to have a certain unique physiology  legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity  and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry climate  and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes. It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils  to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out  and because the leg is like a pendulum  the longer and thinner it is at the extremity  the more energy efficient it is to swing. To put Kalenjin running success in perspective  consider that    American men in history have run faster than two hours and    minutes in the marathon. That's a four minute and    second per mile pace. Thirty two Kalenjin men did that last October. That's from a source population the size of metropolitan Atlanta. Still  even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don't account for all of the changes in performance. Athletes have a different mindset than they once did. Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets an electrical shock and they're thrown across a room  There's no explosion there. What's happening when that happens is that the electrical impulse is causing all their muscle fibers to twitch at once  and they're throwing themselves across the room. They're essentially jumping. That's the power that's contained in the human body. But normally we can't access nearly all of it. Our brain acts as a limiter  preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources  because we might hurt ourselves  tearing tendons or ligaments. But the more we learn about how that limiter functions  the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit  in some cases by convincing the brain that the body won't be in mortal danger by pushing harder. Endurance and ultra endurance sports serve as a great example. Ultra endurance was once thought to be harmful to human health  but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for ultra endurance  no body fur and a glut of sweat glands that keep us cool while running  narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames  large surface area of joints for shock absorption. We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring  short toes that are better for pushing off than for grasping tree limbs  and when we run  we can turn our torso and our shoulders like this while keeping our heads straight. Our primate cousins can't do that. They have to run like this. And we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running. Have you ever looked at an ape's butt  They have no buns because they don't run upright. And as athletes have realized that we're perfectly suited for ultra endurance  they've taken on feats that would have been unthinkable before  athletes like Spanish endurance racer K lian Jornet. Here's K lian running up the Matterhorn. With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist. It's so steep he can't even run here. He's pulling up on a rope. This is a vertical ascent of more than       feet  and K lian went up and down in under three hours. Amazing. And talented though he is  K lian is not a physiological freak. Now that he has done this  other athletes will follow  just as other athletes followed after Sir Roger Bannister ran under four minutes in the mile. Changing technology  changing genes  and a changing mindset. Innovation in sports  whether that's new track surfaces or new swimming techniques  the democratization of sport  the spread to new bodies and to new populations around the world  and imagination in sport  an understanding of what the human body is truly capable of  have conspired to make athletes stronger  faster  bolder  and better than ever. Thank you very much. There are    million people in the world who are blind. Eighty percent of them are living in low income countries such as Kenya  and the absolute majority do not need to be blind. They are blind from diseases that are either completely curable or preventable. Knowing this  with my young family  we moved to Kenya. We secured equipment  funds  vehicles  we trained a team  we set up a hundred clinics throughout the Great Rift Valley to try and understand a single question  why are people going blind  and what can we do  The challenges were great. When we got to where we were going  we set up our high tech equipment. Power was rarely available. We'd have to run our equipment from petrol power generators. And then something occurred to me  There has to be an easier way  because it's the patients who are the most in need of access to eye care who are the least likely to get it. More people in Kenya  and in sub Saharan Africa  have access to a mobile phone than they do clean running water. So we said  could we harness the power of mobile technology to deliver eye care in a new way  And so we developed Peek  a smartphone  system  that enables community healthcare workers and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere. We set about replacing traditional hospital equipment  which is bulky  expensive and fragile  with smartphone apps and hardware that make it possible to test anyone in any language and of any age. Here we have a demonstration of a three month old having their vision accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker. We've got many trials going on in the community and in schools  and through the lessons that we've learned in the field  we've realized it's extremely important to share the data in non medical jargon so that people understand what we're examining and what that means to them. So here  for example  we use our sight sim application  once your vision has been measured  to show carers and teachers what the visual world is like for that person  so they can empathize with them and help them. Once we've discovered somebody has low vision  the next big challenge is to work out why  and to be able to do that  we need to have access to the inside of the eye. Traditionally  this requires expensive equipment to examine an area called the retina. The retina is the single part of the eye that has huge amounts of information about the body and its health. We've developed  D printed  low cost hardware that comes in at less than five dollars to produce  which can then be clipped onto a smartphone and makes it possible to get views of the back of the eye of a very high quality. And the beauty is  anybody can do it. In our trials on over two and half thousand people  the smartphone with the add on clip is comparable to a camera that is hugely more expensive and hugely more difficult to transport. When we first moved to Kenya  we went with         dollars of equipment  a team of    people  and that was what was needed to deliver health care. Now  all that's needed is a single person on a bike with a smartphone. And it costs just     dollars. The issue of power supply is overcome by harnessing the power of solar. Our healthcare workers travel with a solar powered rucksack which keeps the phone charged and backed up. Now we go to the patient rather than waiting for the patient never to come. We go to them in their homes and we give them the most comprehensive  high tech  accurate examination  which can be delivered by anyone with minimal training. We can link global experts with people in the most rural  difficult to reach places that are beyond the end of the road  effectively putting those experts in their homes  allowing us to make diagnoses and make plans for treatment. Project managers  hospital directors  are able to search on our interface by any parameter they may be interested in. Here in Nakuru  where I've been living  we can search for people by whatever condition. Here are people who are blind from a curable condition cataract. Each red pin depicts somebody who is blind from a disease that is curable and treatable  and they're locatable. We can use bulk text messaging services to explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment. What's more  we've learned that this is something that we haven't built just for the community but with the community. Those blue pins that drop represent elders  or local leaders  that are connected to those people who can ensure that we can find them and arrange treatment. So for patients like Mama Wangari  who have been blind for over    years and never seen her grandchildren  for less than    dollars  we can restore her eyesight. This is something that has to happen. It's only in statistics that people go blind by the millions. The reality is everyone goes blind on their own. But now  they might just be a text message away from help. And now because live demos are always a bad idea  we're going to try a live demo. So here we have the Peek Vision app. Okay  and what we're looking at here  this is Sam's optic nerve  which is a direct extension of her brain  so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there. We can see all parts of the retina. It makes it possible to pick up diseases of the eye and of the body that would not be possible without access to the eye  and that clip on device can be manufactured for just a few dollars  and people can be cured of blindness  and I think it says a lot about us as a human race if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them. But now we can. Thank you.
