Ah yes  those university days  a heady mix of Ph.D level pure mathematics and world debating championships  or  as I like to say   Hello  ladies. Oh yeah.  Didn't get much sexier than the Spence at university  let me tell you. It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer from Sydney  Australia  to be here on the TED stage literally on the other side of the world. And I wanted to let you know  a lot of the things you've heard about Australians are true. From the youngest of ages  we display a prodigious sporting talent. On the field of battle  we are brave and noble warriors. What you've heard is true. Australians  we don't mind a bit of a drink  sometimes to excess  leading to embarrassing social situations.  Laughter  This is my father's work Christmas party  December     . I'm almost five years old. Fair to say  I'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was. But I stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host  not as a comedian  but as someone who was  is  and always will be a mathematician. And anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep. I cast my mind back when I was in second grade at a beautiful little government run school called Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney  and as we came up towards lunchtime  our teacher  Ms. Russell  said to the class   Hey  year two. What do you want to do after lunch  I've got no plans.  It was an exercise in democratic schooling  and I am all for democratic schooling  but we were only seven. So some of the suggestions we made as to what we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical  and after a while  someone made a particularly silly suggestion and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism   That wouldn't work. That'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole.  Now I wasn't trying to be smart. I wasn't trying to be funny. I just politely raised my hand  and when Ms. Russell acknowledged me  I said  in front of my year two classmates  and I quote   But Miss  surely if the diagonal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle  well  the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole.   It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop  wouldn't it   And there was that same awkward silence from most of my classmates  until sitting next to me  one of my friends  one of the cool kids in class  Steven  leaned across and punched me really hard in the head. Now what Steven was saying was   Look  Adam  you are at a critical juncture in your life here  my friend. You can keep sitting here with us. Any more of that sort of talk  you've got to go and sit over there with them.  I thought about it for a nanosecond. I took one look at the road map of life  and I ran off down the street marked  Geek  as fast as my chubby  asthmatic little legs would carry me. I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages. I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful. It's natural. It's everywhere. Numbers are the musical notes with which the symphony of the universe is written. The great Descartes said something quite similar. The universe  is written in the mathematical language.  And today  I want to show you one of those musical notes  a number so beautiful  so massive  I think it will blow your mind. Today we're going to talk about prime numbers. Most of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime because it's   x  . Seven is prime because it's   x    but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks  or as we call them  factors. Now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers. One is not prime. The proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties. Another thing about primes  there is no final biggest prime number. They keep going on forever. We know there are an infinite number of primes due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid. Over thousands of years ago  he proved that for us. But the third thing about prime numbers  mathematicians have always wondered  well at any given moment in time  what is the biggest prime that we know about  Today we're going to hunt for that massive prime. Don't freak out. All you need to know  of all the mathematics you've ever learned  unlearned  crammed  forgotten  never understood in the first place  all you need to know is this  When I say        I'm talking about five little number twos next to each other all multiplied together    x   x   x   x  . So       is   x                 . If you've got that  you're with me for the entire journey. Okay  So        those five little twos multiplied together.    is a prime number  and that five in the power is also a prime number. And the vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found are of that form  two to a prime number  take away one. I won't go into great detail as to why  because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do  but suffice to say  a number of that form is fairly easy to test for primacy. A random odd number is a lot harder to test. But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes  we realize it's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power. and you don't need me to tell you that's    x   . But                            After that point  they thin out a lot. And one of the things about the search for massive primes that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds of all time have gone on this search. This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. In the     s  other mathematicians said he is simply the master of us all. He was so respected  they put him on European currency back when that was a compliment. Euler discovered at the time the world's biggest prime  It's over two billion. He proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill  ink  paper and his mind. You think that's big. We know that               is a prime number. It's an absolute brute. Look at it here     digits long  proven to be prime in      by a mathematician called Lucas. Word up  L Dog. But one of the great things about the search for massive primes  it's not just finding the primes. Sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting. Lucas again  in       showed us                  digits long  was not prime. But he didn't know what the factors were. We knew it was like six  but we didn't know what are the   x   that multiply together to give us that massive number. We didn't know for almost    years until Frank Nelson Cole came along. And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians  he walked to the board  took up a piece of chalk  and started writing out the powers of two  two  four  eight        come on  join in with me  you know how it goes                                       . I'm in geek heaven. We'll stop it there for a second. Frank Nelson Cole did not stop there. He went on and on and calculated    powers of two. He took away one and wrote that number on the board. A frisson of excitement went around the room. It got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format    and for the rest of the hour of his talk Frank Nelson Cole busted that out. He had found the prime factors of             . The room went berserk    as Frank Nelson Cole sat down  having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words. He admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do. It took focus. It took dedication. It took him  by his estimate   three years of Sundays.  But then in the field of mathematics  as in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED  the age of the computer goes along and things explode. These are the largest prime numbers we knew decade by decade  each one dwarfing the one before as computers took over and our power to calculate just grew and grew. This is the largest prime number we knew in       a very emotional year for me. It was the year I left university. I was torn between mathematics and media. It was a tough decision. I loved university. My arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life. But I came to a realization about my own ability. Put simply  in a room full of randomly selected people  I'm a maths genius. In a roomful of maths Ph.Ds  I'm as dumb as a box of hammers. My skill is not in the mathematics. It is in telling the story of the mathematics. And during that time  since I've left university  these numbers have got bigger and bigger  each one dwarfing the last  until along came this man  Dr. Curtis Cooper  who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime  only to see it snatched away by a rival university. And then Curtis Cooper got it back. Not years ago  not months ago  days ago. In an amazing moment of serendipity  I had to send TED a new slide to show you what this guy had done. I still remember     Applause     I still remember when it happened. I was doing my breakfast radio show. I looked down on Twitter. There was a tweet   Adam  have you seen the new largest prime number   I shivered    contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room  and said  Girls  hold the front page. We're not talking politics today. We're not talking sport today. They found another megaprime.  The girls just shook their heads  put them in their hands  and let me go my own way. It's because of Curtis Cooper that we know  currently the largest prime number we know  is               . Don't forget to subtract the one. This number is almost    and a half million digits long. If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file  that's    meg. For the slightly less geeky of you  think about the Harry Potter novels  okay  This is the first Harry Potter novel. This is all seven Harry Potter novels  because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end. Written out as a book  this number would run the length of the Harry Potter novels and half again. Here's a slide of the first       digits of this prime. If  when TED had begun  at    o'clock on Tuesday  we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second  it would have taken five hours to show you that number. I was keen to do it  could not convince Bono. That's the way it goes. This number is    and a half thousand slides long  and we know it is prime as confidently as we know the number seven is prime. That fills me with almost sexual excitement. And who am I kidding when I say almost  I know what you're thinking  Adam  we're happy that you're happy  but why should we care  Let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful. First of all  as I explained  to ask a computer  Is that number prime   to type it in its abbreviated form  and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy  is a remarkably simple question to ask. It's got a remarkably clear yes no answer  and just requires phenomenal grunt. Large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips. But secondly  as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime  he wasn't the only guy searching. My laptop at home was looking through four potential candidate primes myself as part of a networked computer hunt around the world for these large numbers. The discovery of that prime is similar to the work people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences  in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects. We live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia but on laptops  desktops  in the palms of people's hands who are simply helping out for the search. But for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor for the time in which we live  when human minds and machines can conquer together. We've heard a lot about robots in this TED. We've heard a lot about what they can and can't do. It is true  you can now download onto your smartphone an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess. You think that's cool. Here's a machine doing something cool. This is the CubeStormer II. It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube. Using the power of the smartphone  it can examine the cube and solve the cube in five seconds. That scares some people. That excites me. How lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together  I was asked in an interview last year in my capacity as a lower case  c  celebrity in Australia   What was your highlight of        People were expecting me to talk about my beloved Sydney Swans football team. In our beautiful  indigenous sport of Australian football  they won the equivalent of the Super Bowl. I was there. It was the most emotional  exciting day. It wasn't my highlight of     . People thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show. It might have been a politician. It might have been a breakthrough. It might have been a book I read  the arts. No  no  no. It might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done. No  it wasn't. The highlight of       so clearly  was the discovery of the Higgs boson. Give it up for the fundamental particle that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass. And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was    years ago Peter Higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions  How is it that the things that make us up have no mass  I've clearly got mass. Where does it come from  And he postulated a suggestion that there's this infinite  incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe  and as other particles go through those particles and interact  that's where they get their mass. The rest of the scientific community said   Great idea  Higgsy. We've got no idea if we could ever prove it. It's beyond our reach.  And within just    years  in his lifetime  with him sitting in the audience  we had designed the greatest machine ever to prove this incredible idea that originated just in a human mind. That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number. We thought it might be there  and we went and found it. That is the essence of being human. That is what we are all about. Or as my friend Descartes might put it  we think  therefore we are. Thank you. I have a confession to make. But first  I want you to make a little confession to me. In the past year  I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively little stress. Anyone  How about a moderate amount of stress  Who has experienced a lot of stress  Yeah. Me too. But that is not my confession. My confession is this  I am a health psychologist  and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier. But I fear that something I've been teaching for the last    years is doing more harm than good  and it has to do with stress. For years I've been telling people  stress makes you sick. It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease. Basically  I've turned stress into the enemy. But I have changed my mind about stress  and today  I want to change yours. Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress. This study tracked        adults in the United States for eight years  and they started by asking people   How much stress have you experienced in the last year   They also asked   Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health   And then they used public death records to find out who died. Okay. Some bad news first. People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a    percent increased risk of dying. But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health. People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die. In fact  they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study  including people who had relatively little stress. Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths          Americans died prematurely  not from stress  but from the belief that stress is bad for you. That is over        deaths a year. Now  if that estimate is correct  that would make believing stress is bad for you the   th largest cause of death in the United States last year  killing more people than skin cancer  HIV AIDS and homicide. You can see why this study freaked me out. Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health. So this study got me wondering  Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier  And here the science says yes. When you change your mind about stress  you can change your body's response to stress. Now to explain how this works  I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out. It's called the social stress test. You come into the laboratory  and you're told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you  and to make sure you feel the pressure  there are bright lights and a camera in your face  kind of like this. And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging  non verbal feedback  like this. Now that you're sufficiently demoralized  time for part two  a math test. And unbeknownst to you  the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it. Now we're going to all do this together. It's going to be fun. For me. Okay. I want you all to count backwards from     in increments of seven. You're going to do this out loud  as fast as you can  starting with    . Go  Go faster. Faster please. You're going too slow. Stop. Stop  stop  stop. That guy made a mistake. We are going to have to start all over again. You're not very good at this  are you  Okay  so you get the idea. If you were actually in this study  you'd probably be a little stressed out. Your heart might be pounding  you might be breathing faster  maybe breaking out into a sweat. And normally  we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure. But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized  was preparing you to meet this challenge  Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University. Before they went through the social stress test  they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful. That pounding heart is preparing you for action. If you're breathing faster  it's no problem. It's getting more oxygen to your brain. And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance  well  they were less stressed out  less anxious  more confident  but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed. Now  in a typical stress response  your heart rate goes up  and your blood vessels constrict like this. And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease. It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time. But in the study  when participants viewed their stress response as helpful  their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this. Their heart was still pounding  but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile. It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage. Over a lifetime of stressful experiences  this one biological change could be the difference between a stress induced heart attack at age    and living well into your   s. And this is really what the new science of stress reveals  that how you think about stress matters. So my goal as a health psychologist has changed. I no longer want to get rid of your stress. I want to make you better at stress. And we just did a little intervention. If you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year  we could have saved your life  because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress  you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself  this is my body helping me rise to this challenge. And when you view stress in that way  your body believes you  and your stress response becomes healthier. Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from  so we are going to do one more intervention. I want to tell you about one of the most under appreciated aspects of the stress response  and the idea is this  Stress makes you social. To understand this side of stress  we need to talk about a hormone  oxytocin  and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname  the cuddle hormone  because it's released when you hug someone. But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in. Oxytocin is a neuro hormone. It fine tunes your brain's social instincts. It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships. Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family. It enhances your empathy. It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about. Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin... to become more compassionate and caring. But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin. It's a stress hormone. Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response. It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound. And when oxytocin is released in the stress response  it is motivating you to seek support. Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel  instead of bottling it up. Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other. When life is difficult  your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you. Okay  so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier  Well  oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain. It also acts on your body  and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress. It's a natural anti inflammatory. It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress. But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart. Your heart has receptors for this hormone  and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress induced damage. This stress hormone strengthens your heart. And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support. So when you reach out to others under stress  either to seek support or to help someone else  you release more of this hormone  your stress response becomes healthier  and you actually recover faster from stress. I find this amazing  that your stress response has a built in mechanism for stress resilience  and that mechanism is human connection. I want to finish by telling you about one more study. And listen up  because this study could also save a life. This study tracked about       adults in the United States  and they ranged in age from    to     and they started the study by asking   How much stress have you experienced in the last year   They also asked   How much time have you spent helping out friends  neighbors  people in your community   And then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died. Okay  so the bad news first  For every major stressful life experience  like financial difficulties or family crisis  that increased the risk of dying by    percent. But    and I hope you are expecting a  but  by now    but that wasn't true for everyone. People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress related increase in dying. Zero. Caring created resilience. And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with others under stress  you can create resilience. Now I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life  but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress. Stress gives us access to our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others  and yes  your pounding physical heart  working so hard to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in this way  you're not just getting better at stress  you're actually making a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone. Thank you. Chris Anderson  This is kind of amazing  what you're telling us. It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy. How would that extend to advice  like  if someone is making a lifestyle choice between  say  a stressful job and a non stressful job  does it matter which way they go  It's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it  in some sense  KM  Yeah  and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort. And so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions  is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows. CA  Thank you so much  Kelly. It's pretty cool. So here's the most important economic fact of our time. We are living in an age of surging income inequality  particularly between those at the very top and everyone else. This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.  but it's a global phenomenon. It's happening in communist China  in formerly communist Russia  it's happening in India  in my own native Canada. We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies like Sweden  Finland and Germany. Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening. In the     s  the One Percent accounted for about    percent of the national income in the United States. Today  their share has more than doubled to above    percent. But what's even more striking is what's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution. The  .  percent in the U.S. today account for more than eight percent of the national income. They are where the One Percent was    years ago. Let me give you another number to put that in perspective  and this is a figure that was calculated in      by Robert Reich  the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men  Bill Gates and Warren Buffett  and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth of the bottom    percent of the U.S. population      million people. Now  as it happens  Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat  he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon  and he has his own favorite number. Buffett likes to point out that in       the combined wealth of the people on the Forbes     list    and this is the list of the     richest Americans    was     billion dollars. Just think about it. You didn't even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in     . Well  today  that figure has more than quintupled to  .  trillion  and I probably don't need to tell you that we haven't seen anything similar happen to the middle class  whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased. So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy  but we've been slow to notice it. One of the reasons  I think  is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon. Changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic. Think about what happened  after all  to the poor frog. But I think there's something else going on. Talking about income inequality  even if you're not on the Forbes     list  can make us feel uncomfortable. It feels less positive  less optimistic  to talk about how the pie is sliced than to think about how to make the pie bigger. And if you do happen to be on the Forbes     list  talking about income distribution  and inevitably its cousin  income redistribution  can be downright threatening. So we're living in the age of surging income inequality  especially at the top. What's driving it  and what can we do about it  One set of causes is political  lower taxes  deregulation  particularly of financial services  privatization  weaker legal protections for trade unions  all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very  very top. A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of  crony capitalism   political changes that benefit a group of well connected insiders but don't actually do much good for the rest of us. In practice  getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult. Think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia  for instance  or how hard it is to re regulate the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the Great Depression  or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies  including those whose motto might be  don't do evil   to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class. But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice is really  really hard  at least intellectually  it's an easy problem. After all  no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism. Indeed  this is one of those rare issues that unites the left and the right. A critique of crony capitalism is as central to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street. But if crony capitalism is  intellectually at least  the easy part of the problem  things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality. In and of themselves  these aren't too mysterious. Globalization and the technology revolution  the twin economic transformations which are changing our lives and transforming the global economy  are also powering the rise of the super rich. Just think about it. For the first time in history  if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea or a fantastic new product  you have almost instant  almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people. As a result  if you are very  very smart and very  very lucky  you can get very  very rich very  very quickly. The latest poster boy for this phenomenon is David Karp. The    year old founder of Tumblr recently sold his company to Yahoo for  .  billion dollars. Think about that for a minute   .  billion dollars     years old. It's easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields  like sports and entertainment. We can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before. But today  that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy. We have superstar technologists. We have superstar bankers. We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects. There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers. There are even  and this is my personal favorite example  superstar dentists  the most dazzling exemplar of whom is Bernard Touati  the Frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich or European born American fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution are creating this global plutocracy  what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it. And that's because  in contrast with crony capitalism  so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive. Let's start with technology. I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices. I love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium. I'm even more of a fan of globalization. This is the transformation which has lifted hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people out of poverty and into the middle class  and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world  it's made many new products affordable    who do you think built your iPhone    and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper. Think of your dishwasher or your t shirt. So what's not to like  Well  a few things. One of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy. Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur who has successfully sold that idea or that product to the global billions and become a billionaire in the process. It gets tempting at that point to use your economic nous to manipulate the rules of the global political economy in your own favor. And that's no mere hypothetical example. Think about Amazon  Apple  Google  Starbucks. These are among the world's most admired  most beloved  most innovative companies. They also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very  very significantly. And why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage  Once you have the tremendous economic power that we're seeing at the very  very top of the income distribution and the political power that inevitably entails  it becomes tempting as well to start trying to change the rules of the game in your own favor. Again  this is no mere hypothetical. It's what the Russian oligarchs did in creating the sale of the century privatization of Russia's natural resources. It's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the U.S. and the U.K. A second thing that worries me is how easily meritocratic plutocracy can become aristocracy. One way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks  and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy. That's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children. The middle class is spending more on schooling too  but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at Harvard  Stanford or MIT  the    percent is increasingly outgunned by the One Percent. The result is something that economists Alan Krueger and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve. As income inequality increases  social mobility decreases. The plutocracy may be a meritocracy  but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race. The third thing  and this is what worries me the most  is the extent to which those same largely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy also happen to be hollowing out the middle class in Western industrialized economies. Let's start with technology. Those same forces that are creating billionaires are also devouring many traditional middle class jobs. When's the last time you used a travel agent  And in contrast with the industrial revolution  the titans of our new economy aren't creating that many new jobs. At its zenith  G.M. employed hundreds of thousands  Facebook fewer than       . The same is true of globalization. For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets  it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed Western economies. The terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity. That's shown in what I consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time. Since the late     s  increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment. That means that our countries are getting richer  our companies are getting more efficient  but we're not creating more jobs and we're not paying people  as a whole  more. One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment. What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario. After all  in a totally free labor market  we could find jobs for pretty much everyone. The dystopia that worries me is a universe in which a few geniuses invent Google and its ilk and the rest of us are employed giving them massages. So when I get really depressed about all of this  I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution. After all  for all its grim  satanic mills  it worked out pretty well  didn't it  After all  all of us here are richer  healthier  taller    well  there are a few exceptions   and live longer than our ancestors in the early   th century. But it's important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society  we had to go through two depressions  the Great Depression of the     s  the Long Depression of the     s  two world wars  communist revolutions in Russia and in China  and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the West. We also  not coincidentally  went through an era of tremendous social and political inventions. We created the modern welfare state. We created public education. We created public health care. We created public pensions. We created unions. Today  we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the Industrial Revolution. To be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats  we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change. We need a new New Deal. You may want to take a closer look. There's more to this painting than meets the eye. And yes  it's an acrylic painting of a man  but I didn't paint it on canvas. I painted it directly on top of the man. What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether  and if I want to paint your portrait  I'm painting it on you  physically on you. That also means you're probably going to end up with an earful of paint  because I need to paint your ear on your ear. Everything in this scene  the person  the clothes  chairs  wall  gets covered in a mask of paint that mimics what's directly below it  and in this way  I'm able to take a three dimensional scene and make it look like a two dimensional painting. I can photograph it from any angle  and it will still look  D. There's no Photoshop here. This is just a photo of one of my three dimensional paintings. You might be wondering how I came up with this idea of turning people into paintings. But originally  this had nothing to do with either people or paint. It was about shadows. I was fascinated with the absence of light  and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed. I came up with the idea of painting shadows. I loved that I could hide within this shadow my own painted version  and it would be almost invisible until the light changed  and all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light. I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on  and I thought of my friend Bernie. But I didn't just want to paint the shadows. I also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale. I had a very specific vision of what this would look like  and as I was painting him  I made sure to follow that very closely. But something kept on flickering before my eyes. I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at. And then when I took that moment to take a step back  magic. I had turned my friend into a painting. I couldn't have foreseen that when I wanted to paint a shadow  I would pull out this whole other dimension  that I would collapse it  that I would take a painting and make it my friend and then bring him back to a painting. I was a little conflicted though  because I was so excited about what I'd found  but I was just about to graduate from college with a degree in political science  and I'd always had this dream of going to Washington  D.C.  and sitting at a desk and working in government. Why did this have to get in the way of all that  I made the tough decision of going home after graduation and not going up to Capitol Hill  but going down to my parents' basement and making it my job to learn how to paint. I had no idea where to begin. The last time I'd painted  I was    years old at summer camp  and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and practicing over and over again on that surface  because that's not what this project was about for me. It was about space and light. My early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas  like fried food. It's nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg. Even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit. It just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink. I'd put something down  and instantly it would be gone. And if I wanted to paint on people  well  I was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that I spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast. It just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself. One of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only didn't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his ears  but he also didn't really have much embarrassment about being taken out into very public places for exhibition  like the Metro. I was having so much fun with this process. I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles  and I wanted to see what else I could do with it. I came together with a collaborator  Sheila Vand  and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface  and that was milk. We got a pool. We filled it with milk. We filled it with Sheila. And I began painting. And the images were always completely unexpected in the end  because I could have a very specific image about how it would turn out  I could paint it to match that  but the moment that Sheila laid back into the milk  everything would change. It was in constant flux  and we had to  rather than fight it  embrace it  see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better. Sometimes  when Sheila would lay down in the milk  it would wash all the paint off of her arms  and it might seem a little bit clumsy  but our solution would be  okay  hide your arms. And one time  she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face. All right  well  hide your face. And we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined  even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands  just hiding them in the pockets. When we started out on the milk project  and when I started out  I couldn't have foreseen that I would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tripping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk. But then again  I guess it's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar  as long as you're willing to look beyond what's already been brought to light  that you can see what's below the surface  hiding in the shadows  and recognize that there can be more there than meets the eye. Thank you. When I was a young man  I spent six years of wild adventure in the tropics working as an investigative journalist in some of the most bewitching parts of the world. I was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be. This is why wars get fought. But I also felt more alive than I've ever done since. And when I came home  I found the scope of my existence gradually diminishing until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge. And I found myself sort of scratching at the walls of life  as if I was trying to find a way out into a wider space beyond. I was  I believe  ecologically bored. Now  we evolved in rather more challenging times than these  in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws. And we still possess the fear and the courage and the aggression required to navigate those times. But in our comfortable  safe  crowded lands  we have few opportunities to exercise them without harming other people. And this was the sort of constraint that I found myself bumping up against. To conquer uncertainty  to know what comes next  that's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies  and having got there  or almost got there  we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs. We've privileged safety over experience and we've gained a lot in doing so  but I think we've lost something too. Now  I don't romanticize evolutionary time. I'm already beyond the lifespan of most hunter gatherers  and the outcome of a mortal combat between me myopically stumbling around with a stone tipped spear and an enraged giant aurochs isn't very hard to predict. Nor was it authenticity that I was looking for. I don't find that a useful or even intelligible concept. I just wanted a richer and rawer life than I've been able to lead in Britain  or  indeed  that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world. And it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word that I began to understand what I was looking for. And as soon as I found that word  I realized that I wanted to devote much of the rest of my life to it. The word is  rewilding   and even though rewilding is a young word  it already has several definitions. But there are two in particular that fascinate me. The first one is the mass restoration of ecosystems. One of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades. A trophic cascade is an ecological process which starts at the top of the food chain and tumbles all the way down to the bottom  and the classic example is what happened in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States when wolves were reintroduced in     . Now  we all know that wolves kill various species of animals  but perhaps we're slightly less aware that they give life to many others. It sounds strange  but just follow me for a while. Before the wolves turned up  they'd been absent for    years. The numbers of deer  because there was nothing to hunt them  had built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park  and despite efforts by humans to control them  they'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there to almost nothing  they'd just grazed it away. But as soon as the wolves arrived  even though they were few in number  they started to have the most remarkable effects. First  of course  they killed some of the deer  but that wasn't the major thing. Much more significantly  they radically changed the behavior of the deer. The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park  the places where they could be trapped most easily  particularly the valleys and the gorges  and immediately those places started to regenerate. In some areas  the height of the trees quintupled in just six years. Bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen and willow and cottonwood. And as soon as that happened  the birds started moving in. The number of songbirds  of migratory birds  started to increase greatly. The number of beavers started to increase  because beavers like to eat the trees. And beavers  like wolves  are ecosystem engineers. They create niches for other species. And the dams they built in the rivers provided habitats for otters and muskrats and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians. The wolves killed coyotes  and as a result of that  the number of rabbits and mice began to rise  which meant more hawks  more weasels  more foxes  more badgers. Ravens and bald eagles came down to feed on the carrion that the wolves had left. Bears fed on it too  and their population began to rise as well  partly also because there were more berries growing on the regenerating shrubs  and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves by killing some of the calves of the deer. But here's where it gets really interesting. The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers. They began to meander less. There was less erosion. The channels narrowed. More pools formed  more riffle sections  all of which were great for wildlife habitats. The rivers changed in response to the wolves  and the reason was that the regenerating forests stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often  so that the rivers became more fixed in their course. Similarly  by driving the deer out of some places and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides  there was less soil erosion  because the vegetation stabilized that as well. So the wolves  small in number  transformed not just the ecosystem of the Yellowstone National Park  this huge area of land  but also its physical geography. Whales in the southern oceans have similarly wide ranging effects. One of the many post rational excuses made by the Japanese government for killing whales is that they said   Well  the number of fish and krill will rise and then there'll be more for people to eat.  Well  it's a stupid excuse  but it sort of kind of makes sense  doesn't it  because you'd think that whales eat huge amounts of fish and krill  so obviously take the whales away  there'll be more fish and krill. But the opposite happened. You take the whales away  and the number of krill collapses. Why would that possibly have happened  Well  it now turns out that the whales are crucial to sustaining that entire ecosystem  and one of the reasons for this is that they often feed at depth and then they come up to the surface and produce what biologists politely call large fecal plumes  huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters  up in the photic zone  where there's enough light to allow photosynthesis to take place  and those great plumes of fertilizer stimulate the growth of phytoplankton  the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain  which stimulate the growth of zooplankton  which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it. The other thing that whales do is that  as they're plunging up and down through the water column  they're kicking the phytoplankton back up towards the surface where it can continue to survive and reproduce. And interestingly  well  we know that plant plankton in the oceans absorb carbon from the atmosphere    the more plant plankton there are  the more carbon they absorb    and eventually they filter down into the abyss and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system. Well  it seems that when whales were at their historic populations  they were probably responsible for sequestering some tens of millions of tons of carbon every year from the atmosphere. And when you look at it like that  you think  wait a minute  here are the wolves changing the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park. Here are the whales changing the composition of the atmosphere. You begin to see that possibly  the evidence supporting James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis  which conceives of the world as a coherent  self regulating organism  is beginning  at the ecosystem level  to accumulate. Trophic cascades tell us that the natural world is even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was. They tell us that when you take away the large animals  you are left with a radically different ecosystem to one which retains its large animals. And they make  in my view  a powerful case for the reintroduction of missing species. Rewilding  to me  means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals. It means taking down the fences  it means blocking the drainage ditches  it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea  but otherwise stepping back. It has no view as to what a right ecosystem or a right assemblage of species looks like. It doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef. It lets nature decide  and nature  by and large  is pretty good at deciding. Now  I mentioned that there are two definitions of rewilding that interest me. The other one is the rewilding of human life. And I don't see this as an alternative to civilization. I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology  as we're doing now  but at the same time  if we choose  have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure when we want to because there would be wonderful  rewilded habitats. And the opportunities for this are developing more rapidly than you might think possible. There's one estimate which suggests that in the United States  two thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared has become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated  particularly from the eastern half of the country. There's another one which suggests that    million hectares of land in Europe  an area the size of Poland  will be vacated by farmers between      and     . Now  faced with opportunities like that  does it not seem a little unambitious to be thinking only of bringing back wolves  lynx  bears  beavers  bison  boar  moose  and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across Europe  Perhaps we should also start thinking about the return of some of our lost megafauna. What megafauna  you say  Well  every continent had one  apart from Antarctica. When Trafalgar Square in London was excavated  the river gravels there were found to be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus  rhinos  elephants  hyenas  lions. Yes  ladies and gentlemen  there were lions in Trafalgar Square long before Nelson's Column was built. All these species lived here in the last interglacial period  when temperatures were pretty similar to our own. It's not climate  largely  which has got rid of the world's megafaunas. It's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so. And even so  you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems. Why is it that so many deciduous trees are able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken  Why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark  Why do understory trees  which are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind and have to carry less weight than the big canopy trees  why are they so much tougher and harder to break than the canopy trees are  Elephants. They are elephant adapted. In Europe  for example  they evolved to resist the straight tusked elephant  elephas antiquus  which was a great beast. It was related to the Asian elephant  but it was a temperate animal  a temperate forest creature. It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant. But why is it that some of our common shrubs have spines which seem to be over engineered to resist browsing by deer  Perhaps because they evolved to resist browsing by rhinoceros. Isn't it an amazing thought that every time you wander into a park or down an avenue or through a leafy street  you can see the shadows of these great beasts  Paleoecology  the study of past ecosystems  crucial to an understanding of our own  feels like a portal through which you may pass into an enchanted kingdom. And if we really are looking at areas of land of the sort of sizes I've been talking about becoming available  why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna  or at least species closely related to those which have become extinct everywhere  Why shouldn't all of us have a Serengeti on our doorsteps  And perhaps this is the most important thing that rewilding offers us  the most important thing that's missing from our lives  hope. In motivating people to love and defend the natural world  an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair. The story rewilding tells us is that ecological change need not always proceed in one direction. It offers us the hope that our silent spring could be replaced by a raucous summer. Thank you. This is Charley Williams. He was    when this photograph was taken. In the     s  Roosevelt put thousands and thousands of Americans back to work by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels  but he also did something interesting  which was to hire a few hundred writers to scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans. Charley Williams  a poor sharecropper  wouldn't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview  but Charley had actually been a slave until he was    years old. And the stories that were captured of his life make up one of the crown jewels of histories  of human lived experiences filled with ex slaves. Anna Deavere Smith famously said that there's a literature inside of each of us  and three generations later  I was part of a project called StoryCorps  which set out to capture the stories of ordinary Americans by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces. The idea is very  very simple. You go into these booths  you interview your grandmother or relative  you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the Library of Congress. It's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive one conversation at a time. And the question is  who do you want to remember    if you had just    minutes with your grandmother  What's interesting  in conversations with the founder  Dave Isay  we always actually talked about this as a little bit of a subversive project  because when you think about it  it's actually not really about the stories that are being told  it's about listening  and it's about the questions that you get to ask  questions that you may not have permission to on any other day. I'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project.  Jesus Melendez talking about poet Pedro Pietri's final moments  Jesus Melendez  We took off  and as we were ascending  before we had leveled off  our level off point was        feet  so before we had leveled off  Pedro began leaving us  and the beauty about it is that I believe that there's something after life. You can see it in Pedro.  Danny Perasa to his wife Annie Perasa married    years  Danny Perasa  See  the thing of it is  I always feel guilty when I say  I love you  to you  and I say it so often. I say it to remind you that as dumpy as I am  it's coming from me  it's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio  and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.  Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz  Michael Wolmetz  So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother  and we can leave it there. And he saved up and he purchased this  and he proposed to my mother with this  and so I thought that I would give it to you so that he could be with us for this also. So I'm going to share a mic with you right now  Debora. Where's the right finger  Debora Brakarz   Crying  MW  Debora  will you please marry me  DB  Yes. Of course. I love you. MW  So kids  this is how your mother and I got married  in a booth in Grand Central Station with my father's ring. My grandfather was a cab driver for    years. He used to pick people up here every day. So it seems right. Jake Barton  So I have to say I did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry. The entire project is predicated on this act of love which is listening itself. And that motion of building an institution out of a moment of conversation and listening is actually a lot of what my firm  Local Projects  is doing with our engagements in general. So we're a media design firm  and we're working with a broad array of different institutions building media installations for museums and public spaces. Our latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art  which we've created an engagement called Gallery One for. And Gallery One is an interesting project because it started with this massive       million expansion for the Cleveland Museum of Art  and we actually brought in this piece specifically to grow new capacity  new audiences  at the same time that the museum itself is growing. Glenn Lowry  the head of MoMA  put it best when he said   We want visitors to actually cease being visitors. Visitors are transient. We want people who live here  people who have ownership.  And so what we're doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries  so you can still have a traditional gallery experience  but if you're interested  you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it's from  or manipulate the work itself. So  for example  you can click on this individual lion head  and this is where it originated from       B.C. Or this individual piece here  you can see the actual bedroom. It really changes the way you think about this type of a tempera painting. This is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself. This is Rodin's bust. You get the sense of this incredible factory for creativity. And it makes you think about literally the hundreds or thousands of years of human creativity and how each individual artwork stands in for part of that story. This is Picasso  of course embodying so much of it from the   th century. And so our next interface  which I'll show you  actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity. It's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse the actual museum's collection using facial recognition. So this person's making different faces  and it's actually drawing forth different objects from the collection that connect with exactly how she's looking. And so you can imagine that  as people are performing inside of the museum itself  you get this sense of this emotional connection  this way in which our face connects with the thousands and tens of thousands of years. This is an interface that actually allows you to draw and then draws forth objects using those same shapes. So more and more we're trying to find ways for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves  to be creative even as they're looking at other people's creativity and understanding them. So in this wall  the collections wall  you can actually see all       artworks all at the same time  and you can actually author your own individual walking tours of the museum  so you can share them  and someone can take a tour with the museum director or a tour with their little cousin. But all the while that we've been working on this engagement for Cleveland  we've also been working in the background on really our largest engagement to date  and that's the      Memorial and Museum. So we started in      as part of a team with Thinc Design to create the original master plan for the museum  and then we've done all the media design both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production. So the memorial opened in       and the museum's going to open next year in     . And you can see from these images  the site is so raw and almost archaeological. And of course the event itself is so recent  somewhere between history and current events  it was a huge challenge to imagine how do you actually live up to a space like this  an event like this  to actually tell that story. And so what we started with was really a new way of thinking about building an institution  through a project called Make History  which we launched in     . So it's estimated that a third of the world watched      live  and a third of the world heard about it within    hours  making it really by nature of when it happened  this unprecedented moment of global awareness. And so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world  through video  through photos  through written history  and so people's experiences on that day  which was  in fact  this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this open platform. But that was coupled together with this oral histories booth  really the simplest we've ever made  where you locate yourself on a map. It's in six languages  and you can tell your own story about what happened to you on that day. And when we started seeing the incredible images and stories that came forth from all around the world    this is obviously part of the landing gear    we really started to understand that there was this amazing symmetry between the event itself  between the way that people were telling the stories of the event  and how we ourselves needed to tell that story. This image in particular really captured our attention at the time  because it so much sums up that event. This is a shot from the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. There's a firefighter that's stuck  actually  in traffic  and so the firefighters themselves are running a mile and a half to the site itself with upwards of    pounds of gear on their back. And we got this amazing email that said   While viewing the thousands of photos on the site  I unexpectedly found a photo of my son. It was a shock emotionally  yet a blessing to find this photo   and he was writing because he said   I'd like to personally thank the photographer for posting the photo  as it meant more than words can describe to me to have access to what is probably the last photo ever taken of my son.  And it really made us recognize what this institution needed to be in order to actually tell that story. We can't have just a historian or a curator narrating objectively in the third person about an event like that  when you have the witnesses to history who are going to make their way through the actual museum itself. And so we started imagining the museum  along with the creative team at the museum and the curators  thinking about how the first voice that you would hear inside the museum would actually be of other visitors. And so we created this idea of an opening gallery called We Remember. And I'll just play you part of a mockup of it  but you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter into that moment in time and be transported back in history. Voice    Sur les Champs  lys es    Paris. Voice    In college  at U.C. Berkeley. Voice    I was in Times Square. Voice    S o Paolo  Brazil. Voice    It was probably about    o'clock at night. Voice    I was driving to work at      local time in the morning. Voice    We were actually in a meeting when someone barged in and said   Oh my God  a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center.  Voice     Trying to frantically get to a radio. Voice     When I heard it over the radio    Voice     Heard it on the radio. Voice     I got a call from my father. Voice     The phone rang  it woke me up. My business partner told me to turn on the television. Voice     So I switched on the television. Voice     All channels in Italy were displaying the same thing. Voice     The Twin Towers. Voice     The Twin Towers. JB  And you move from there into that open  cavernous space. This is the so called slurry wall. It's the original  excavated wall at the base of the World Trade Center that withstood the actual pressure from the Hudson River for a full year after the event itself. And so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity  of presence of that moment into the actual exhibition itself. And we tell the stories of being inside the towers through that same audio collage  so you're hearing people literally talking about seeing the planes as they make their way into the building  or making their way down the stairwells. And as you make your way into the exhibition where it talks about the recovery  we actually project directly onto these moments of twisted steel all of the experiences from people who literally excavated on top of the pile itself. And so you can hear oral histories    so people who were actually working the so called bucket brigades as you're seeing literally the thousands of experiences from that moment. And as you leave that storytelling moment understanding about       we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening and actually talk to the individual visitors and ask them their own experiences about     . And we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable  the types of questions that      itself draws forth for all of us. And so these are questions like   How can a democracy balance freedom and security    How could      have happened    And how did the world change after        And so these oral histories  which we've actually been capturing already for years  are then mixed together with interviews that we're doing with people like Donald Rumsfeld  Bill Clinton  Rudy Giuliani  and you mix together these different players and these different experiences  these different reflection points about     . And suddenly the institution  once again  turns into a listening experience. So I'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices  but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event. Voice    It's something that we shared  and it's something that united us. Voice    And I knew when I saw that  people who were there that day who immediately went to help people known and unknown to them was something that would pull us through. Voice    All the outpouring of affection and emotion that came from our country was something really that will forever  ever stay with me. Voice    Still today I pray and think about those who lost their lives  and those who gave their lives to help others  but I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country  the love  the compassIon  the strength  and I watched a nation come together in the middle of a terrible tragedy. JB  And so as people make their way out of the museum  reflecting on the experience  reflecting on their own thoughts of it  they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself  because they've gone back up to grade  and we actually got involved in the memorial after we'd done the museum for a few years. The original designer of the memorial  Michael Arad  had this image in his mind of all the names appearing undifferentiated  almost random  really a poetic reflection on top of the nature of a terrorism event itself  but it was a huge challenge for the families  for the foundation  certainly for the first responders  and there was a negotiation that went forth and a solution was found to actually create not an order in terms of chronology  or in terms of alphabetical  but through what's called meaningful adjacency. So these are groupings of the names themselves which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order  and we  along with Jer Thorp  created an algorithm to take massive amounts of data to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves. So this is an image of the actual algorithm itself with the names scrambled for privacy  but you can see that these blocks of color are actually the four different flights  the two different towers  the first responders  and you can actually see within that different floors  and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections that were requested by the families themselves. And so when you go to the memorial  you can actually see the overarching organization inside of the individual pools themselves. You can see the way that the geography of the event is reflected inside of the memorial  and you can search for an individual name  or in this case an employer  Cantor Fitzgerald  and see the way in which all of those names  those hundreds of names  are actually organized onto the memorial itself  and use that to navigate the memorial. And more importantly  when you're actually at the site of the memorial  you can see those connections. You can see the relationships between the different names themselves. So suddenly what is this undifferentiated  anonymous group of names springs into reality as an individual life. In this case  Harry Ramos  who was the head trader at an investment bank  who stopped to aid Victor Wald on the   th floor of the South Tower. And Ramos told Wald  according to witnesses   I'm not going to leave you.  And Wald's widow requested that they be listed next to each other. Three generations ago  we had to actually get people to go out and capture the stories for common people. Today  of course  there's an unprecedented amount of stories for all of us that are being captured for future generations. And this is our hope  that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories. Thank you very much. When I was about three or four years old  I remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers  and I remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book  to feel the picture they were discussing. And my mum said   Darling  remember that you can't see and you can't feel the picture and you can't feel the print on the page.  And I thought to myself   But that's what I want to do. I love stories. I want to read.  Little did I know that I would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true. I was born premature by about    weeks  which resulted in my blindness  some    years ago. The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia  and it's now very rare in the developed world. Little did I know  lying curled up in my prim baby humidicrib in      that I'd been born at the right place and the right time  that I was in a country where I could participate in the technological revolution. There are    million totally blind people on our planet  but those of us who've shared in the technological changes mainly come from North America  Europe  Japan and other developed parts of the world. Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world  but I think they've changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group. And so I want to tell you about the interaction between computer based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years to become the person I am today. It's an interaction between volunteers  passionate inventors and technology  and it's a story that many other blind people could tell. But let me tell you a bit about it today. When I was five  I went to school and I learned braille. It's an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper  and I can feel them with my fingers. In fact  I think they're putting up my grade six report. I don't know where Julian Morrow got that from. I was pretty good in reading  but religion and musical appreciation needed more work. When you leave the opera house  you'll find there's braille signage in the lifts. Look for it. Have you noticed it  I do. I look for it all the time. When I was at school  the books were transcribed by transcribers  voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so I'd have volumes to read  and that had been going on  mainly by women  since the late   th century in this country  but it was the only way I could read. When I was in high school  I got my first Philips reel to reel tape recorder  and tape recorders became my sort of pre computer medium of learning. I could have family and friends read me material  and I could then read it back as many times as I needed. And it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers. For example  when I studied at graduate school at Queen's University in Canada  the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me. I gave them a tape recorder  and they read into it. As one of them said to me   Ron  we ain't going anywhere at the moment.  But think of it. These men  who hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had  helped me gain post graduate qualifications in law by their dedicated help. Well  I went back and became an academic at Melbourne's Monash University  and for those    years  tape recorders were everything to me. In fact  in my office in       I had    miles of tape. Students  family and friends all read me material. Mrs. Lois Doery  whom I later came to call my surrogate mum  read me many thousands of hours onto tape. One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lois would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her. But sadly  her health hasn't permitted her to come today. But I thank you here  Lois  from this platform. I saw my first Apple computer in       and I thought to myself   This thing's got a glass screen  not much use to me.  How very wrong I was. In       in the month our eldest son Gerard was born  I got my first blind computer  and it's actually here. See it up there  And you see it has no  what do you call it  no screen. It's a blind computer. It's a Keynote Gold   k  and the   k stands for it had    kilobytes of memory. Don't laugh  it cost me       dollars at the time.  Laughter  I think there's more memory in my watch. It was invented by Russell Smith  a passionate inventor in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people. Sadly  he died in a light plane crash in       but his memory lives on in my heart. It meant  for the first time  I could read back what I had typed into it. It had a speech synthesizer. I'd written my first coauthored labor law book on a typewriter in      purely from memory. This now allowed me to read back what I'd written and to enter the computer world  even with its   k of memory. In       the great Ray Kurzweil  the American inventor  worked on building a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech. Optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font  but by using charge coupled device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers  he developed a machine that could read any font. And his machine  which was as big as a washing machine  was launched on the   th of January      . I saw my first commercially available Kurzweil in March       and it blew me away  and in September       the month that my associate professorship at Monash University was announced  the law school got one  and I could use it. For the first time  I could read what I wanted to read by putting a book on the scanner. I didn't have to be nice to people  I no longer would be censored. For example  I was too shy then  and I'm actually too shy now  to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material. But  you know  I could pop a book on in the middle of the night  and    Now  the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop. That's what it's shrunk to. And now I can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries. I can keep up with my friends. There are many people who have helped me in my life  and many that I haven't met. One is another American inventor Ted Henter. Ted was a motorcycle racer  but in      he had a car accident and lost his sight  which is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes. He then turned to being a waterskier and was a champion disabled waterskier. But in       he teamed up with Bill Joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the Net or from what was on the computer. It's called JAWS  Job Access With Speech  and it sounds like this. Ron McCallum  Isn't that slow  You see  if I read like that  I'd fall asleep. I slowed it down for you. I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it. Can we play that one  RM  You know  when you're marking student essays  you want to get through them fairly quickly. This technology that fascinated me in      is now on my iPhone and on yours as well. But  you know  I find reading with machines a very lonely process. I grew up with family  friends  reading to me  and I loved the warmth and the breath and the closeness of people reading. Do you love being read to  And one of my most enduring memories is in       Mary reading to me and the children down near Manly Beach  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.  Isn't that a great book  I still love being close to someone reading to me. But I wouldn't give up the technology  because it's allowed me to lead a great life. Of course  talking books for the blind predated all this technology. After all  the long playing record was developed in the early     s  and now we put talking books on CDs using the digital access system known as DAISY. But when I'm reading with synthetic voices  I love to come home and read a racy novel with a real voice. Now there are still barriers in front of we people with disabilities. Many websites we can't read using JAWS and the other technologies. Websites are often very visual  and there are all these sorts of graphs that aren't labeled and buttons that aren't labeled  and that's why the World Wide Web Consortium    known as W C  has developed worldwide standards for the Internet. And we want all Internet users or Internet site owners to make their sites compatible so that we persons without vision can have a level playing field. There are other barriers brought about by our laws. For example  Australia  like about one third of the world's countries  has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled or read for we blind persons. But those books can't travel across borders. For example  in Spain  there are a         accessible books in Spanish. In Argentina  there are       . In no other Latin American country are there more than a couple of thousand. But it's not legal to transport the books from Spain to Latin America. There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the United States  Britain  Canada  Australia  etc.  but they can't be transported to the    countries in our world where English is the first and the second language. And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter. Well  because we can't transport books across borders  there had to be separate versions read in all the different English speaking countries  Britain  United States  Canada  Australia  and New Zealand all had to have separate readings of Harry Potter. And that's why  next month in Morocco  a meeting is taking place between all the countries. It's something that a group of countries and the World Blind Union are advocating  a cross border treaty so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception  we can transport those books across borders and give life to people  particularly in developing countries  blind people who don't have the books to read. I want that to happen. My life has been extraordinarily blessed with marriage and children and certainly interesting work to do  whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School  where I served a term as dean  or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  in Geneva. I've indeed been a very fortunate human being. I wonder what the future will hold. The technology will advance even further  but I can still remember my mum saying     years ago   Remember  darling  you'll never be able to read the print with your fingers.  I'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers  volunteer readers and passionate inventors  has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me and for blind people throughout the world. I'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin  who is my slide clicker  who clicks the slides  and my wife  Professor Mary Crock  who's the light of my life  is coming on to collect me. I want to thank her too. I think I have to say goodbye now. Bless you. Thank you very much. Yay   Applause  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Applause  So over the long course of human history  the infectious disease that's killed more humans than any other is malaria. It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos  and it's probably our oldest scourge. We may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes. And to this day  malaria takes a huge toll on our species. We've got     million cases a year and over half a million deaths. Now this really makes no sense. We've known how to cure malaria since the     s. That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru discovered the bark of the cinchona tree  and inside that bark was quinine  still an effective cure for malaria to this day. So we've known how to cure malaria for centuries. We've known how to prevent malaria since     . That's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria  not bad air or miasmas  as was previously thought. So malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve  and yet to this day  hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from the bite of a mosquito. Why is that  This is a question that's personally intrigued me for a long time. I grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants visiting my cousins in India every summer  and because I had no immunity to the local malarias  I was made to sleep under this hot  sweaty mosquito net every night while my cousins  they were allowed to sleep out on the terrace and have this nice  cool night breeze wafting over them. And I really hated the mosquitos for that. But at the same time  I come from a Jain family  and Jainism is a religion that espouses a very extreme form of nonviolence. So Jains are not supposed to eat meat. We're not supposed to walk on grass  because you could  you know  inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass. We're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos. So the fearsome power of this little insect was apparent to me from a very young age  and it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist trying to understand  why has malaria been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long  And I think there's three main reasons why. Those three reasons add up to the fourth reason  which is probably the biggest reason of all. The first reason is certainly scientific. This little parasite that causes malaria  it's probably one of the most complex and wily pathogens known to humankind. It lives half its life inside the cold blooded mosquito and half its life inside the warm blooded human. These two environments are totally different  but not only that  they're both utterly hostile. So the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite  and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off. This little creature survives under siege like that  but not only does it survive  it has thrived. It has spread. It has more ways to evade attack than we know. It's a shape shifter  for one thing. Just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly  the malaria parasite transforms itself like that seven times in its life cycle. And each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other  they have totally different physiology. So say you came up with some great drug that worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle. It might do nothing at all to any of the other stages. It can hide in our bodies  undetected  unbeknownst to us  for days  for weeks  for months  for years  in some cases even decades. So the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle  but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite. Only about    species of mosquitos carry most of the world's malaria  and we know quite a bit about the kinds of watery habitats that they specialize in. So you might think  then  well  why don't we just avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live  Right  We could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live. But say you live in the tropics and you walk outside your hut one day and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt around your home. Or say your cow does  or say your pig does  and then  say  it rains  and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water. That's it. You've created the perfect malarial mosquito habitat that's right outside your door. So it's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects. We kind of create places that they love to live just by living our own lives. So there's a huge scientific challenge  but there's a huge economic challenge too. Malaria occurs in some of the poorest and most remote places on Earth  and there's a reason for that. If you're poor  you're more likely to get malaria. If you're poor  you're more likely to live in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained. These are places where mosquitos breed. You're less likely to have door screens or window screens. You're less likely to have electricity and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible  so you're outside more. You're getting bitten by mosquitos more. So poverty causes malaria  but what we also know now is that malaria itself causes poverty. For one thing  it strikes hardest during harvest season  so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields collecting their crops  they're home sick with a fever. But it also predisposes people to death from all other causes. So this has happened historically. We've been able to take malaria out of a society. Everything else stays the same  so we still have bad food  bad water  bad sanitation  all the things that make people sick. But just if you take malaria out  deaths from everything else go down. And the economist Jeff Sachs has actually quantified what this means for a society. What it means is  if you have malaria in your society  your economic growth is depressed by  .  percent every year  year after year after year  just this one disease alone. So this poses a huge economic challenge  because say you do come up with your great drug or your great vaccine    how do you deliver it in a place where there's no roads  there's no infrastructure  there's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold  there's no clinics  there's no clinicians to deliver these things where they're needed  So there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria. But along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge  there's also a cultural challenge  and this is probably the part about malaria that people don't like to talk about. And it's the paradox that the people who have the most malaria in the world tend to care about it the least. This has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again. They ask people in malarious parts of the world   What do you think about malaria   And they don't say   It's a killer disease. We're scared of it.  They say   Malaria is a normal problem of life.  And that was certainly my personal experience. When I told my relatives in India that I was writing a book about malaria  they kind of looked at me like I told them I was writing a book about warts or something. Like  why would you write about something so boring  so ordinary  You know  And it's simple risk perception  really. A child in Malawi  for example  she might have    episodes of malaria before the age of two  but if she survives  she'll continue to get malaria throughout her life  but she's much less likely to die of it. And so in her lived experience  malaria is something that comes and goes. And that's actually true for most of the world's malaria. Most of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own. It's just  there's so much malaria that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death add up to this big  huge number. So I think people in malarious parts of the world must think of malaria the way those of us who live in the temperate world think of cold and flu. Right  Cold and flu have a huge burden on our societies and on our own lives  but we don't really even take the most rudimentary precautions against it because we consider it normal to get cold and flu during cold and flu season. And so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria  because if people think it's normal to have malaria  then how do you get them to run to the doctor to get diagnosed  to pick up their prescription  to get it filled  to take the drugs  to put on the repellents  to tuck in the bed nets  This is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease. So take all that together. We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated  it's economically challenging to deal with  and it's one for which the people who stand to benefit the most care about it the least. And that adds up to the biggest problem of all  which  of course  is the political problem. How do you get a political leader to do anything about a problem like this  And the answer is  historically  you don't. Most malarious societies throughout history have simply lived with the disease. So the main attacks on malaria have come from outside of malarious societies  from people who aren't constrained by these rather paralyzing politics. But this  I think  introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties. The first concerted attack against malaria started in the     s. It was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department. And this effort well understood the economic challenge. They knew they had to focus on cheap  easy to use tools  and they focused on DDT. They understood the cultural challenge. In fact  their rather patronizing view was that people at risk of malaria shouldn't be asked to do anything at all. Everything should be done to them and for them. But they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge. They had so much faith in their tools that they stopped doing malaria research. And so when those tools started to fail  and public opinion started to turn against those tools  they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do. The whole campaign crashed  malaria resurged back  but now it was even worse than before because it was corralled into the hardest to reach places in the most difficult to control forms. One WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign  one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health.  The latest effort to tame malaria started in the late     s. It's similarly directed and financed primarily from outside of malarious societies. Now this effort well understands the scientific challenge. They are doing tons of malaria research. And they understand the economic challenge too. They're focusing on very cheap  very easy to use tools. But now  I think  the dilemma is the cultural challenge. The centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net. It's treated with insecticides. This thing has been distributed across the malarious world by the millions. And when you think about the bed net  it's sort of a surgical intervention. You know  it doesn't really have any value to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria. And yet we're asking people to use these nets every night. They have to sleep under them every night. That's the only way they are effective. And they have to do that even if the net blocks the breeze  even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night and relieve themselves  even if they might have to move all their furnishings to put this thing up  even if  you know  they might live in a round hut in which it's difficult to string up a square net. Now that's no big deal if you're fighting a killer disease. I mean  these are minor inconveniences. But that's not how people with malaria think of malaria. So for them  the calculus must be quite different. Imagine  for example  if a bunch of well meaning Kenyans came up to those of us in the temperate world and said   You know  you people have a lot of cold and flu. We've designed this great  easy to use  cheap tool  we're going to give it to you for free. It's called a face mask  and all you need to do is wear it every day during cold and flu season when you go to school and when you go to work.  Would we do that  And I wonder if that's how people in the malarious world thought of those nets when they first received them  Indeed  we know from studies that only    percent of the bed nets that were first distributed were actually used. And even that's probably an overestimate  because the same people who distributed the nets went back and asked the recipients   Oh  did you use that net I gave you   Which is like your Aunt Jane asking you   Oh  did you use that vase I gave you for Christmas   So it's probably an overestimate. But that's not an insurmountable problem. We can do more education  we can try to convince these people to use the nets. And that's what happening now. We're throwing a lot more time and money into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays and school meetings  all these things to convince people to use the nets we gave you. And that might work. But it takes time. It takes money. It takes resources. It takes infrastructure. It takes all the things that that cheap  easy to use bed net was not supposed to be. So it's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies  but it's equally tricky when we try to attack it from outside of those societies. We end up imposing our own priorities on the people of the malarious world. That's exactly what we did in the     s  and that effort backfired. I would argue today  when we are distributing tools that we've designed and that don't necessarily make sense in people's lives  we run the risk of making the same mistake again. That's not to say that malaria is unconquerable  because I think it is  but what if we attacked this disease according to the priorities of the people who lived with it  Take the example of England and the United States. We had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years  and we got rid of it completely  not because we attacked malaria. We didn't. We attacked bad roads and bad houses and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty. We attacked the malarious way of life  and by doing that  we slowly built malaria out. Now attacking the malarious way of life  this is something    these are things people care about today. And attacking the malarious way of life  it's not fast  it's not cheap  it's not easy  but I think it's the only lasting way forward. Thank you so much. Do you think it's possible to control someone's attention  Even more than that  what about predicting human behavior  I think those are interesting ideas. For me  that would be the perfect superpower  actually kind of an evil way of approaching it. But for myself  in the past  I've spent the last    years studying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way  picking pockets. When we think of misdirection  we think of something as looking off to the side  when actually the things right in front of us are often the hardest to see  the things that you look at every day that you're blinded to. For example  how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now  Great. Double check. Make sure you still have them. I was doing some shopping before. You've looked at them a few times today  but I'll ask you a question. Without looking at it directly yet  can you remember the icon in the bottom right corner  Bring them out  check and see how accurate you were. How'd you do  Show of hands. Did we get it  Now that you're done  close them down. Every phone has something in common. No matter how you organize the icons  you still have a clock on the front. So  without looking at your phone  what time was it  You just looked at your clock  right  Interesting idea. Let's take that a step further with a game of trust. Close your eyes. I realize I'm asking you to do that while you just heard there's a pickpocket in the room  but close your eyes. Now  you've been watching me for about    seconds. With your eyes closed  what am I wearing  Make your best guess. What color is my shirt  What color is my tie  Now open your eyes. Show of hands  were you right  Interesting  isn't it  Some of us are a little bit more perceptive than others  it seems. But I have a different theory about that model of attention. They have fancy models of attention  Posner's trinity model of attention. For me  I like to think of it very simple  like a surveillance system. It's kind of like you have all these fancy sensors  and inside your brain is a little security guard. For me  I like to call him Frank. So Frank is sitting at a desk. He's got lots of cool information in front of him  high tech equipment  he's got cameras  he's got a little phone that he can pick up  listen to the ears  all these senses  all these perceptions. But attention is what steers your perceptions  it's what controls your reality. It's the gateway to the mind. If you don't attend to something  you can't be aware of it. But ironically  you can attend to something without being aware of it. For example  the cocktail effect  You're in a party  having conversations with someone  and yet you can recognize your name without realizing you were listening to that. Now  for my job  I have to play with techniques to exploit this  to play with your attention as a limited resource. So if I could control how you spend your attention  if I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction. Now  instead of doing it like misdirection and throwing it off to the side  instead  what I choose to focus on is Frank  to be able to play with the Frank inside your head  your security guard  and get you  instead of focusing on your external senses  just to go internal for a second. So if I ask you to access a memory  like  what is that  What just happened  Do you have a wallet  Do you have an American Express in your wallet  And when I do that  your Frank turns around. He accesses the file. He has to rewind the tape. What's interesting is  he can't rewind the tape at the same time that he's trying to process new data. This sounds like a good theory  but I could talk for a long time  tell you lots of things  and a portion of them may be true  but I think it's better if I tried to show that to you here live. If I come down  I'm going to do a bit of shopping. Just hold still where you are. Hello  how are you  It's lovely to see you. Wonderful job onstage. Lovely watch  it doesn't come off very well. Do you have a ring as well  Good. Just taking inventory. You're like a buffet. Hard to tell where to start  so many great things. Hi  how are you  Good to see you. Hi  sir  could you stand up  please  Just right where you are. You're married  you follow directions well. Nice to meet you  sir. You don't have a lot in your pockets. Anything down here  Hopefully so. Have a seat. There you go. You're doing well. Hi  sir  how are you  Good to see you  sir. You have a ring  a watch. Do you have a wallet on you  Joe  I don't. AR  Well  we'll find one for you. Come on up this way  Joe. Give Joe a round of applause. Come on up  Joe. Let's play a game. AR  Pardon me. I don't think I need this clicker anymore. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Come on up to the stage  Joe. Let's play a little game now. Anything in your front pockets  J  Money. AR  Money  All right  let's try that. Can you stand right over this way for me  Turn around and  let's see  if I give you something that belongs to me  this is just something I have  a poker chip. Hold out your hand for me. Watch it closely. This is a task for you to focus on. You have your money in your front pocket  J  Yup. AR  Good. I won't put my hand in your pocket. I'm not ready for that kind of commitment. Once a guy had a hole in his pocket  and that was rather traumatizing for me. I wanted his wallet  he gave me his number. Big miscommunication. Let's do this simply. Squeeze your hand tight. Do you feel the poker chip in your hand  J  I do. AR  Would you be surprised if I took it  Say yes. J  Very. AR  Good. Open your hand. Thank you very much. I'll cheat if you give me a chance. Make it harder for me. Just use your hand. Grab my wrist  but squeeze  squeeze firm. Did you see it go  Joe  No. AR  No  it's not here. Open your hand. While we're focused on the hand  it's sitting on your shoulder. Go ahead and take it off. Now  let's try that again. Hold your hand out flat. Open it up. Put your hand up a little bit higher  but watch it close. If I did it slowly  it'd be on your shoulder. Joe  we're going to keep doing this till you catch it. You'll get it eventually. I have faith in you. Squeeze firm. You're human  you're not slow. It's back on your shoulder. You were focused on your hand  distracted. While you were watching  I couldn't get your watch off. Yet you had something inside your pocket. Do you remember what it was  J  Money. AR  Check your pocket. Is it still there  Oh  there it was. Put it away. We're just shopping. This trick's more about the timing. I'm going to try to push it inside your hand. Put your other hand on top  would you  It's amazingly obvious now  isn't it  Looks a lot like the watch I was wearing  doesn't it  J  That's pretty good. AR  Oh  thanks. But it's only a start. Let's try it a little bit differently. Hold your hands together. Your other hand on top. If you're watching this little token  this obviously has become a little target  like a red herring. If we watch this kind of close  it looks like it goes away. It's not back on your shoulder. It falls out of the air  lands right back in the hand. Did you see it go  Yeah  funny. We've got a little guy. He's union  works up there all day. If I do it slowly it goes straight away  it lands by your pocket. Is it in this pocket  sir  Don't reach in your pocket. That's a different show. That's rather strange. They have shots for that. Can I show them  Rather bizarre. Is this yours  sir  I have no idea how that works. We'll send that over there. I need help with this one. Step over this way for me. Don't run away. You had something down by your pants pocket. I was checking mine. I couldn't find everything  but I noticed you had something here. Can I feel the outside for a moment  Down here I noticed this. Is this something of yours  sir  I have no idea. That's a shrimp. J  Yeah. I'm saving it for later. AR  You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way  better than you know. So we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift. Hopefully it matches his taste. We have a couple of other things  a little bit of cash. And we have a few other things  these all belong to you  along with a big round of applause from all your friends. Joe  thank you very much. So  same question I asked you before  but this time you don't have to close your eyes. What am I wearing  Audience  Oh  Attention is a powerful thing. Like I said  it shapes your reality. So  I guess I'd like to pose that question to you. If you could control somebody's attention  what would you do with it  Thank you. I'm going to be showing some of the cybercriminals' latest and nastiest creations. So basically  please don't go and download any of the viruses that I show you. Some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like  and I thought I'd give you a quick insight into my career so far. It's a pretty accurate description. This is what someone that specializes in malware and hacking looks like. So today  computer viruses and trojans  designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your webcam to the theft of billions of dollars. Some malicious code today goes as far as targeting power  utilities and infrastructure. Let me give you a quick snapshot of what malicious code is capable of today. Right now  every second  eight new users are joining the Internet. Today  we will see         individual new computer viruses. We will see        new infected websites. And  just to kind of tear down a myth here  lots of people think that when you get infected with a computer virus  it's because you went to a porn site. Right  Well  actually  statistically speaking  if you only visit porn sites  you're safer. People normally write that down  by the way.  Laughter  Actually  about    percent of these are small business websites getting infected. Today's cybercriminal  what do they look like  Well  many of you have the image  don't you  of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement  hacking away for notoriety. But actually today  cybercriminals are wonderfully professional and organized. In fact  they have product adverts. You can go online and buy a hacking service to knock your business competitor offline. Check out this one I found. and that reason is because you need your business competitors  rivals  haters  or whatever the reason is  or who  they are to go down. Well you  my friend  you've came to the right place. If you want your business competitors to go down  well  they can. If you want your rivals to go offline  well  they will. Not only that  we are providing a short term to long term DDOS service or scheduled attack  starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites to    to    dollars per hour. James Lyne  Now  I did actually pay one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website. Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company. Turns out that's not cool. But regardless  it's amazing how many products and services are available now to cybercriminals. For example  this testing platform  which enables the cybercriminals to test the quality of their viruses before they release them on the world. For a small fee  they can upload it and make sure everything is good. But it goes further. Cybercriminals now have crime packs with business intelligence reporting dashboards to manage the distribution of their malicious code. This is the market leader in malware distribution  the Black Hole Exploit Pack  responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution in the last couple of quarters. It comes with technical installation guides  video setup routines  and get this  technical support. You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you how to set up your illegal hacking server. So let me show you what malicious code looks like today. What I've got here is two systems  an attacker  which I've made look all Matrix y and scary  and a victim  which you might recognize from home or work. Now normally  these would be on different sides of the planet or of the Internet  but I've put them side by side because it makes things much more interesting. Now  there are many ways you can get infected. You will have come in contact with some of them. Maybe some of you have received an email that says something like   Hi  I'm a Nigerian banker  and I'd like to give you    billion dollars because I like your face.  Or funnycats.exe  which rumor has it was quite successful in China's recent campaign against America. Now there are many ways you can get infected. I want to show you a couple of my favorites. This is a little USB key. Now how do you get a USB key to run in a business  Well  you could try looking really cute. Awww. Or  in my case  awkward and pathetic. So imagine this scenario  I walk into one of your businesses  looking very awkward and pathetic  with a copy of my C.V. which I've covered in coffee  and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key and print me a new one. So let's have a look here on my victim computer. What I'm going to do is plug in the USB key. After a couple of seconds  things start to happen on the computer on their own  usually a bad sign. This would  of course  normally happen in a couple of seconds  really  really quickly  but I've kind of slowed it down so you can actually see the attack occurring. Malware is very boring otherwise. So this is writing out the malicious code  and a few seconds later  on the left hand side  you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text. Now if I place the mouse cursor over it  this is what we call a command prompt  and using this we can navigate around the computer. We can access your documents  your data. You can turn on the webcam. That can be very embarrassing. Or just to really prove a point  we can launch programs like my personal favorite  the Windows Calculator. So isn't it amazing how much control the attackers can get with such a simple operation  Let me show you how most malware is now distributed today. What I'm going to do is open up a website that I wrote. It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics. And it's got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website. Many of you will have used something a bit like this before. Unfortunately  when this was implemented  the developer was slightly inebriated and managed to forget all of the secure coding practices he had learned. So let's imagine that our attacker  called Evil Hacker just for comedy value  inserts something a little nasty. This is a script. It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage. So I'm going to submit this post  and then  on my victim computer  I'm going to open up the web browser and browse to my website  www.incrediblyhacked.com. Notice that after a couple of seconds  I get redirected. That website address at the top there  which you can just about see  microshaft.com  the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs  and up pops fake antivirus. This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software  and it will go through and it will scan the system  have a look at what its popping up here. It creates some very serious alerts. Oh look  a child porn proxy server. We really should clean that up. What's really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data  but when the scan finishes  they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses  you have to register the product. Now I liked it better when viruses were free. People now pay cybercriminals money to run viruses  which I find utterly bizarre. So anyway  let me change pace a little bit. Chasing         pieces of malware a day is a massive challenge  and those numbers are only growing directly in proportion to the length of my stress line  you'll note here. So I want to talk to you briefly about a group of hackers we tracked for a year and actually found    and this is a rare treat in our job. Now this was a cross industry collaboration  people from Facebook  independent researchers  guys from Sophos. So here we have a couple of documents which our cybercriminals had uploaded to a cloud service  kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive  like many of you might use. At the top  you'll notice a section of source code. What this would do is send the cybercriminals a text message every day telling them how much money they'd made that day  so a kind of cybercriminal billings report  if you will. If you look closely  you'll notice a series of what are Russian telephone numbers. Now that's obviously interesting  because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals. Down below  highlighted in red  in the other section of source code  is this bit  leded leded.  That's a username  kind of like you might have on Twitter. So let's take this a little further. There are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded. Lots of you here will use smartphones to take photos and post them from the conference. An interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones is that when you take a photo  it embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken. In fact  I've been spending a lot of time on Internet dating sites recently  obviously for research purposes  and I've noticed that about    percent of the profile pictures on Internet dating sites contain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken  which is kind of scary because you wouldn't give out your home address to lots of strangers  but we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates to plus or minus    meters. And our cybercriminals had done the same thing. So here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg. We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool. We used Google. Using the email address  the telephone number and the GPS data  on the left you see an advert for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling  on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens. One of these was more stereotypical for me. A little more searching  and here's our cybercriminal. Imagine  these are hardened cybercriminals sharing information scarcely. Imagine what you could find about each of the people in this room. A bit more searching through the profile and there's a photo of their office. They were working on the third floor. And you can also see some photos from his business companion where he has a taste in a certain kind of image. It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation. But this is where our investigation starts to slow down. The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well. And herein is the greatest lesson of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now. Our friends  our families and our colleagues can break our security even when we do the right things. This is MobSoft  one of the companies that this cybercriminal gang owned  and an interesting thing about MobSoft is the    percent owner of this posted a job advert  and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers from the code earlier. This woman was Maria  and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals. And it's kind of like she went into her social media settings and clicked on every option imaginable to make herself really  really insecure. By the end of the investigation  where you can read the full    page report at that link  we had photos of the cybercriminals  even the office Christmas party when they were out on an outing. That's right  cybercriminals do have Christmas parties  as it turns out. Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys. Let me come back to that in just a minute. I want to change pace to one last little demonstration  a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic  but is interesting in exposing how much information we're all giving away  and it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience. This is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately. Many of you all know about the concept of scanning for wireless networks. You do it every time you take out your iPhone or your Blackberry and connect to something like TEDAttendees. But what you might not know is that you're also beaming out a list of networks you've previously connected to  even when you're not using wireless actively. So I ran a little scan. I was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals  who wouldn't be so concerned by law  and here you can see my mobile device. Okay  So you can see a list of wireless networks. TEDAttendees  HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying  My home network  PrettyFlyForAWifi  which I think is a great name. Sophos Visitors  SANSEMEA  companies I work with. Loganwifi  that's in Boston. HiltonLondon. CIASurveillanceVan. We called it that at one of our conferences because we thought that would freak people out  which is quite fun. This is how geeks party. So let's make this a little bit more interesting. Let's talk about you. Twenty three percent of you have been to Starbucks recently and used the wireless network. Things get more interesting. Forty six percent of you I could link to a business  XYZ Employee network. This isn't an exact science  but it gets pretty accurate. Seven hundred and sixty one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently  absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe. Two hundred and thirty four of you  well  I know where you live. Your wireless network name is so unique that I was able to pinpoint it using data available openly on the Internet with no hacking or clever  clever tricks. And I should mention as well that some of you do use your names   James Lyne's iPhone   for example. And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity. So something for you to think about  As we adopt these new applications and mobile devices  as we play with these shiny new toys  how much are we trading off convenience for privacy and security  Next time you install something  look at the settings and ask yourself   Is this information that I want to share  Would someone be able to abuse it   We also need to think very carefully about how we develop our future talent pool. You see  technology's changing at a staggering rate  and that         pieces of malware won't stay the same for long. There's a very concerning trend that whilst many people coming out of schools now are much more technology savvy  they know how to use technology  fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects to know how that technology works under the covers. In the U.K.  a    percent reduction since       and there are similar statistics all over the world. We also need to think about the legal issues in this area. The cybercriminals I talked about  despite theft of millions of dollars  actually still haven't been arrested  and at this point possibly never will. Most laws are national in their implementation  despite cybercrime conventions  where the Internet is borderless and international by definition. Countries do not agree  which makes this area exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective. But my biggest ask is this  You see  you're going to leave here and you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news. You're going to read about malware doing incredible and terrifying  scary things. However     percent of it works because people fail to do the basics. So my ask is this  Go online  find these simple best practices  find out how to update and patch your computer. Get a secure password. Make sure you use a different password on each of your sites and services online. Find these resources. Apply them. The Internet is a fantastic resource for business  for political expression  for art and for learning. Help me and the security community make life much  much more difficult for cybercriminals. Thank you. This is our life with bees  and this is our life without bees. Bees are the most important pollinators of our fruits and vegetables and flowers and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals. More than one third of the world's crop production is dependent on bee pollination. But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there pollinating our food intentionally. They're out there because they need to eat. Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar. They're flower feeders  and as they move from flower to flower  basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart  they end up providing this valuable pollination service. In parts of the world where there are no bees  or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees  people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand. These people are moving pollen from flower to flower with a paintbrush. Now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon. Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand held vibrator. Now this one's the tomato tickler.  Laughter  Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower  the anther  and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it. So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it  and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note C. So they vibrate the flower  they sonicate it  and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh  and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body  and she takes it home as food. Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pollination when it's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes. So there's other  maybe more personal reasons  to care about bees. There's over        species of bees in the world  and they're absolutely gorgeous. These bees spend the majority of their life cycle hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem and very few of these beautiful species have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees. Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative for the other        plus species because there's something about honeybees that draws people into their world. Humans have been drawn to honeybees since early recorded history  mostly to harvest their honey  which is an amazing natural sweetener. I got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke. I was    years old and bored  and I picked up a book in the library on bees and I spent the night reading it. I had never thought about insects living in complex societies. It was like the best of science fiction come true. And even stranger  there were these people  these beekeepers  that loved their bees like they were family  and when I put down the book  I knew I had to see this for myself. So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper  a family that owned       hives of bees in New Mexico. And I was permanently hooked. Honeybees can be considered a super organism  where the colony is the organism and it's comprised of        to        individual bee organisms. Now this society has no central authority. Nobody's in charge. So how they come to collective decisions  and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor  how they communicate where the flowers are  all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing. My personal favorite  and one that I've studied for many years  is their system of healthcare. So bees have social healthcare. So in my lab  we study how bees keep themselves healthy. For example  we study hygiene  where some bees are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest  from the colony  and it keeps the colony healthy. And more recently  we've been studying resins that bees collect from plants. So bees fly to some plants and they scrape these very  very sticky resins off the leaves  and they take them back to the nest where they cement them into the nest architecture where we call it propolis. We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant. It's a natural antibiotic. It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony  and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity. Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times. We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies for human medicine  but we didn't know how good it was for the bees. So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over    million years. So seven years ago  when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse  first in the United States  it was clear that there was something really  really wrong. In our collective conscience  in a really primal way  we know we can't afford to lose bees. So what's going on  Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes  and I'll go through each of these. The bottom line is  bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape and a dysfunctional food system. Now we have the best data on honeybees  so I'll use them as an example. In the United States  bees in fact have been in decline since World War II. We have half the number of managed hives in the United States now compared to     . We're down to about two million hives of bees  we think. And the reason is  after World War II  we changed our farming practices. We stopped planting cover crops. We stopped planting clover and alfalfa  which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil  and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers. Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees. And after World War II  we started using herbicides to kill off the weeds in our farms. Many of these weeds are flowering plants that bees require for their survival. And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures. Now we talk about food deserts  places in our cities  neighborhoods that have no grocery stores. The very farms that used to sustain bees are now agricultural food deserts  dominated by one or two plant species like corn and soybeans. Since World War II  we have been systematically eliminating many of the flowering plants that bees need for their survival. And these monocultures extend even to crops that are good for bees  like almonds. Fifty years ago  beekeepers would take a few colonies  hives of bees into the almond orchards  for pollination  and also because the pollen in an almond blossom is really high in protein. It's really good for bees. Now  the scale of almond monoculture demands that most of our nation's bees  over  .  million hives of bees  be transported across the nation to pollinate this one crop. And they're trucked in in semi loads  and they must be trucked out  because after bloom  the almond orchards are a vast and flowerless landscape. Bees have been dying over the last    years  and we're planting more crops that need them. There has been a     percent increase in crop production that requires bee pollination. And then there's pesticides. After World War II  we started using pesticides on a large scale  and this became necessary because of the monocultures that put out a feast for crop pests. Recently  researchers from Penn State University have started looking at the pesticide residue in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food  and they've found that every batch of pollen that a honeybee collects has at least six detectable pesticides in it  and this includes every class of insecticides  herbicides  fungicides  and even inert and unlabeled ingredients that are part of the pesticide formulation that can be more toxic than the active ingredient. This small bee is holding up a large mirror. How much is it going to take to contaminate humans  One of these class of insecticides  the neonicontinoids  is making headlines around the world right now. You've probably heard about it. This is a new class of insecticides. It moves through the plant so that a crop pest  a leaf eating insect  would take a bite of the plant and get a lethal dose and die. If one of these neonics  we call them  is applied in a high concentration  such as in this ground application  enough of the compound moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and the nectar  where a bee can consume  in this case  a high dose of this neurotoxin that makes the bee twitch and die. In most agricultural settings  on most of our farms  it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide  and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and nectar  and if a bee consumes this lower dose  either nothing happens or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented and she may not find her way home. And on top of everything else  bees have their own set of diseases and parasites. Public enemy number one for bees is this thing. It's called varroa destructor. It's aptly named. It's this big  blood sucking parasite that compromises the bee's immune system and circulates viruses. Let me put this all together for you. I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a big  bloodsucking parasite running around on it  and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus  but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus  the flu  and I know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition. But what if I lived in a food desert  And what if I had to travel a long distance to get to the grocery store  and I finally got my weak body out there and I consumed  in my food  enough of a pesticide  a neurotoxin  that I couldn't find my way home  And this is what we mean by multiple and interacting causes of death. And it's not just our honeybees. All of our beautiful wild species of bees are at risk  including those tomato pollinating bumblebees. These bees are providing backup for our honeybees. They're providing the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees. We need all of our bees. So what are we going to do  What are we going to do about this big bee bummer that we've created  It turns out  it's hopeful. It's hopeful. Every one of you out there can help bees in two very direct and easy ways. Plant bee friendly flowers  and don't contaminate these flowers  this bee food  with pesticides. So go online and search for flowers that are native to your area and plant them. Plant them in a pot on your doorstep. Plant them in your front yard  in your lawns  in your boulevards. Campaign to have them planted in public gardens  community spaces  meadows. Set aside farmland. We need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season  from spring to fall. We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees  but also for migrating butterflies and birds and other wildlife. And we need to think carefully about putting back in cover crops to nourish our soil and nourish our bees. And we need to diversify our farms. We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt the agricultural food desert and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system that we've created. So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure to a big  huge problem    just go plant flowers    but when bees have access to good nutrition  we have access to good nutrition through their pollination services. And when bees have access to good nutrition  they're better able to engage their own natural defenses  their healthcare  that they have relied on for millions of years. So the beauty of helping bees this way  for me  is that every one of us needs to behave a little bit more like a bee society  an insect society  where each of our individual actions can contribute to a grand solution  an emergent property  that's much greater than the mere sum of our individual actions. So let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large scale change. On behalf of the bees  thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Just a quick question. The latest numbers on the die off of bees  is there any sign of things bottoming out  What's your hope depression level on this  Maria Spivak  Yeah. At least in the United States  an average of    percent of all bee hives are lost every winter. About    years ago  we were at a    percent loss. So it's getting precarious. CA  That's not    percent a year  that's    MS  Yes  thirty percent a year. CA  Thirty percent a year. MS  But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies and so they can maintain the same number  they can recuperate some of their loss. We're kind of at a tipping point. We can't really afford to lose that many more. We need to be really appreciative of all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers. CA  Thank you. Eric Berlow  I'm an ecologist  and Sean's a physicist  and we both study complex networks. And we met a couple years ago when we discovered that we had both given a short TED Talk about the ecology of war  and we realized that we were connected by the ideas we shared before we ever met. And then we thought  you know  there are thousands of other talks out there  especially TEDx Talks  that are popping up all over the world. How are they connected  and what does that global conversation look like  So Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that. Sean Gourley  Exactly. So we took        TEDx Talks from around the world      different countries  and we took these talks and we wanted to find the mathematical structures that underly the ideas behind them. And we wanted to do that so we could see how they connected with each other. And so  of course  if you're going to do this kind of stuff  you need a lot of data. So the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube  and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from YouTube  all the comments  all the views  who's watching it  where are they watching it  what are they saying in the comments. But we can also pull up  using speech to text translation  we can pull the entire transcript  and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself. So we can take their transcript and actually do some pretty cool things. We can take natural language processing algorithms to kind of read through with a computer  line by line  extracting key concepts from this. And we take those key concepts and they sort of form this mathematical structure of an idea. And we call that the meme ome. And the meme ome  you know  quite simply  is the mathematics that underlies an idea  and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it  which I want to share with you now. So each idea has its own meme ome  and each idea is unique with that  but of course  ideas  they borrow from each other  they kind of steal sometimes  and they certainly build on each other  and we can go through mathematically and take the meme ome from one talk and compare it to the meme ome from every other talk  and if there's a similarity between the two of them  we can create a link and represent that as a graph  just like Eric and I are connected. So that's theory  that's great. Let's see how it works in actual practice. So what we've got here now is the global footprint of all the TEDx Talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner. And what we did on this is we analyzed the top    percent of these  and we started to see where the connections occurred  where they connected with each other. Cameron Russell talking about image and beauty connected over into Europe. We've got a bigger conversation about Israel and Palestine radiating outwards from the Middle East. And we've got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint reminiscent of a conversation that is happening everywhere. So from this  we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection  but luckily  computer technology allows us to go out into multidimensional space. So we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this  and the similar talks kind of smash together  and the different ones fly apart  and what we're left with is something quite beautiful. EB  So I want to just point out here that every node is a talk  they're linked if they share similar ideas  and that comes from a machine reading of entire talk transcripts  and then all these topics that pop out  they're not from tags and keywords. They come from the network structure of interconnected ideas. Keep going. SG  Absolutely. So I got a little quick on that  but he's going to slow me down. We've got education connected to storytelling triangulated next to social media. You've got  of course  the human brain right next to healthcare  which you might expect  but also you've got video games  which is sort of adjacent  as those two spaces interface with each other. But I want to take you into one cluster that's particularly important to me  and that's the environment. And I want to kind of zoom in on that and see if we can get a little more resolution. So as we go in here  what we start to see  apply the physics engine again  we see what's one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones. The structure starts to emerge where we see a kind of fractal behavior of the words and the language that we use to describe the things that are important to us all around this world. So you've got food economy and local food at the top  you've got greenhouse gases  solar and nuclear waste. What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations  each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share  creating a broader concept of the environment. And of course  from here  we can go and zoom in and see  well  what are young people looking at  And they're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion. This is their kind of resonance for the conversation around the environment. If we split along gender lines  we can see females resonating heavily with food economy  but also out there in hope and optimism. And so there's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here  and I'll throw to Eric for the next part. EB  Yeah  I mean  just to point out here  you cannot get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on YouTube. Let's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment  and look at all the talks together. Now often  when we're faced with this amount of content  we do a couple of things to simplify it. We might just say  well  what are the most popular talks out there  And a few rise to the surface. There's a talk about gratitude. There's another one about personal health and nutrition. And of course  there's got to be one about porn  right  And so then we might say  well  gratitude  that was last year. What's trending now  What's the popular talk now  And we can see that the new  emerging  top trending topic is about digital privacy. So this is great. It simplifies things. But there's so much creative content that's just buried at the bottom. And I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface that's maybe really creative and interesting  Well  we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that. Remember  it's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics  and let's say we could take two of them  like cities and genetics  and say  well  are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines. And that's    Essentially  this kind of creative remix is one of the hallmarks of innovation. Well here's one by Jessica Green about the microbial ecology of buildings. It's literally defining a new field. And we could go back to those topics and say  well  what talks are central to those conversations  In the cities cluster  one of the most central was one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities  and in the genetics cluster  we have a talk about synthetic biology by Craig Venter. These are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline. We could go the other direction and say  well  what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields. We used a measure of ecological diversity to get this. Like  a talk by Steven Pinker on the history of violence  very synthetic. And then  of course  there are talks that are so unique they're kind of out in the stratosphere  in their own special place  and we call that the Colleen Flanagan index. And if you don't know Colleen  she's an artist  and I asked her   Well  what's it like out there in the stratosphere of our idea space   And apparently it smells like bacon. I wouldn't know. So we're using these network motifs to find talks that are unique  ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields  ones that are central to their topic  and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields. Okay  We never would have found those with our obsession with what's trending now. And all of this comes from the architecture of complexity  or the patterns of how things are connected. SG  So that's exactly right. We've got ourselves in a world that's massively complex  and we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it. And those algorithms  whilst being kind of useful  are also very  very narrow  and we can do better than that  because we can realize that their complexity is not random. It has mathematical structure  and we can use that mathematical structure to go and explore things like the world of ideas to see what's being said  to see what's not being said  and to be a little bit more human and  hopefully  a little smarter. Thank you. When my father and I started a company to  D print human tissues and organs  some people initially thought we were a little crazy. But since then  much progress has been made  both in our lab and other labs around the world. And given this  we started getting questions like   If you can grow human body parts  can you also grow animal products like meat and leather   When someone first suggested this to me  quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy  but what I soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all. What's crazy is what we do today. I'm convinced that in    years  when we look back on today and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals to make our hamburgers and our handbags  we'll see this as being wasteful and indeed crazy. Did you know that today we maintain a global herd of    billion animals to provide our meat  dairy  eggs and leather goods  And over the next few decades  as the world's population expands to    billion  this will need to nearly double to     billion animals. But maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet. Animals are not just raw materials. They're living beings  and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land  fresh water  and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases which drive climate change. On top of this  when you get so many animals so close together  it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse. Clearly  we cannot continue on this path which puts the environment  public health  and food security at risk. There is another way  because essentially  animal products are just collections of tissues  and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues. What if  instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal  we started with what the tissues are made of  the basic unit of life  the cell  This is biofabrication  where cells themselves can be used to grow biological products like tissues and organs. Already in medicine  biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts  like ears  windpipes  skin  blood vessels and bone  that have been successfully implanted into patients. And beyond medicine  biofabrication can be a humane  sustainable and scalable new industry. And we should begin by reimagining leather. I emphasize leather because it is so widely used. It is beautiful  and it has long been a part of our history. Growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat. It mainly uses one cell type  and it is largely two dimensional. It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators. Until biofabrication is better understood  it is clear that  initially at least  more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat novel foods  no matter how delicious. In this sense  leather is a gateway material  a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry. If we can succeed here  it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon. Now how do we do it  To grow leather  we begin by taking cells from an animal  through a simple biopsy. The animal could be a cow  lamb  or even something more exotic. This process does no harm  and Daisy the cow can live a happy life. We then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium. This takes millions of cells and expands them into billions. And we then coax these cells to produce collagen  as they would naturally. This collagen is the stuff between cells. It's natural connective tissue. It's the extracellular matrix  but in leather  it's the main building block. And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets  and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another  like phyllo pastry  to form thicker sheets  which we then let mature. And finally  we take this multilayered skin and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process  we create leather. And so I'm very excited to show you  for the first time  the first batch of our cultured leather  fresh from the lab. This is real  genuine leather  without the animal sacrifice. It can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells  and better yet  there is no hair to remove  no scars or insect's bites  and no waste. This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet  a handbag or a car seat. It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator. And because we make this material  we grow this leather from the ground up  we can control its properties in very interesting ways. This piece of leather is a mere seven tissue layers thick  and as you can see  it is nearly transparent. And this leather is    layers thick and quite opaque. You don't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather. And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities  like softness  breathability  durability  elasticity and even things like pattern. We can mimic nature  but in some ways also improve upon it. This type of leather can do what today's leather does  but with imagination  probably much more. What could the future of animal products look like  It need not look like this  which is actually the state of the art today. Rather  it could be much more like this. Already  we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years  beginning with products like wine  beer and yogurt. And speaking of food  our cultured food has evolved  and today we prepare cultured food in beautiful  sterile facilities like this. A brewery is essentially a bioreactor. It is where cell culture takes place. Imagine that in this facility  instead of brewing beer  we were brewing leather or meat. Imagine touring this facility  learning about how the leather or meat is cultured  seeing the process from beginning to end  and even trying some. It's clean  open and educational  and this is in contrast to the hidden  guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today. Perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind. It's environmentally responsible  efficient and humane. It allows us to be creative. We can design new materials  new products  and new facilities. We need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved. Perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured. Thank you. Democracy is in trouble  no question about that  and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded. It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions we face that have to do with global pandemics  a cross border problem  with HIV  a transnational problem  with markets and immigration  something that goes beyond national borders  with terrorism  with war  all now cross border problems. In fact  we live in a   st century world of interdependence  and brutal interdependent problems  and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy  we are faced with political institutions designed     years ago  autonomous  sovereign nation states with jurisdictions and territories separate from one another  each claiming to be able to solve the problem of its own people. Twenty first century  transnational world of problems and challenges    th century world of political institutions. In that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy. And like many others  I've been thinking about what can one do about this  this asymmetry between   st century challenges and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional political institutions like nation states. And my suggestion is that we change the subject  that we stop talking about nations  about bordered states  and we start talking about cities. Because I think you will find  when we talk about cities  we are talking about the political institutions in which civilization and culture were born. We are talking about the cradle of democracy. We are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together to create democracy  and at the same time protest those who would take our freedom  take place. Think of some great names  the Place de la Bastille  Zuccotti Park  Tahrir Square  Taksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul  or  yes  Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Those are the public spaces where we announce ourselves as citizens  as participants  as people with the right to write our own narratives. Cities are not only the oldest of institutions  they're the most enduring. If you think about it  Constantinople  Istanbul  much older than Turkey. Alexandria  much older than Egypt. Rome  far older than Italy. Cities endure the ages. They are the places where we are born  grow up  are educated  work  marry  pray  play  get old  and in time  die. They are home. Very different than nation states  which are abstractions. We pay taxes  we vote occasionally  we watch the men and women we choose rule rule more or less without us. Not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live. Moreover  today  more than half of the world's population live in cities. In the developed world  it's about    percent. More than three out of four people live in urban institutions  urban places  in cities today. So cities are where the action is. Cities are us. Aristotle said in the ancient world  man is a political animal. I say we are an urban animal. We are an urban species  at home in our cities. So to come back to the dilemma  if the dilemma is we have old fashioned political nation states unable to govern the world  respond to the global challenges that we face like climate change  then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world  for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent to engage in global governance. When I say if mayors ruled the world  when I first came up with that phrase  it occurred to me that actually  they already do. There are scores of international  inter city  cross border institutions  networks of cities in which cities are already  quite quietly  below the horizon  working together to deal with climate change  to deal with security  to deal with immigration  to deal with all of those tough  interdependent problems that we face. They have strange names  UCLG  United Cities and Local Governments  ICLEI  the International Council for Local Environmental Issues. And the list goes on  Citynet in Asia  City Protocol  a new organization out of Barcelona that is using the web to share best practices among countries. And then all the things we know a little better  the U.S. Conference of Mayors  the Mexican Conference of Mayors  the European Conference of Mayors. Mayors are where this is happening. And so the question is  how can we create a world in which mayors and the citizens they represent play a more prominent role  Well  to understand that  we need to understand why cities are special  why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents  because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum. To be a prime minister or a president  you have to have an ideology  you have to have a meta narrative  you have to have a theory of how things work  you have to belong to a party. Independents  on the whole  don't get elected to office. But mayors are just the opposite. Mayors are pragmatists  they're problem solvers. Their job is to get things done  and if they don't  they're out of a job. Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said  we could never get away here in Philadelphia with the stuff that goes on in Washington  the paralysis  the non action  the inaction. Why  Because potholes have to get filled  because the trains have to run  because kids have to be able to get to school. And that's what we have to do  and to do that is about pragmatism in that deep  American sense  reaching outcomes. Washington  Beijing  Paris  as world capitals  are anything but pragmatic  but real city mayors have to be pragmatists. They have to get things done  they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside and draw their cities together. We saw this a couple of decades ago when Teddy Kollek  the great mayor of Jerusalem in the '  s and the '  s  was besieged one day in his office by religious leaders from all of the backgrounds  Christian prelates  rabbis  imams. They were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites. And the squabble went on and on  and Kollek listened and listened  and he finally said   Gentlemen  spare me your sermons  and I will fix your sewers.  That's what mayors do. They fix sewers  they get the trains running. There isn't a left or a right way of doing. Boris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho Tory. Strange term  but in some ways  he is. He's a libertarian. He's an anarchist. He rides to work on a bike  but at the same time  he's in some ways a conservative. Bloomberg in New York was a Democrat  then he was a Republican  and finally he was an Independent  and said the party label just gets in the way. Luzhkov     years mayor in Moscow  though he helped found a party  United Party with Putin  in fact refused to be defined by the party and finally  in fact  lost his job not under Brezhnev  not under Gorbachev  but under Putin  who wanted a more faithful party follower. So mayors are pragmatists and problem solvers. They get things done. But the second thing about mayors is they are also what I like to call homeboys  or to include the women mayors  homies. They're from the neighborhood. They're part of the neighborhood. They're known. Ed Koch used to wander around New York City saying   How am I doing   Imagine David Cameron wandering around the United Kingdom asking   How am I doing   He wouldn't like the answer. Or Putin. Or any national leader. He could ask that because he knew New Yorkers and they knew him. Mayors are usually from the places they govern. It's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor. You can run for the Senate out of a different state  but it's hard to do that as a mayor. And as a result  mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level  and this is the third feature about mayors  than national governing officials. In the United States  we know the pathetic figures     percent of Americans approve of Congress and what they do. And even with a relatively popular president like Obama  the figures for the Presidency run about         sometimes    percent at best. The Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be. But when you ask   Do you trust your city councillor  do you trust your mayor   the rates shoot up to         even    percent  because they're from the neighborhood  because the people they work with are their neighbors  because  like Mayor Booker in Newark  a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work and go in and pull people out of a burning building    that happened to Mayor Booker    or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work because he sees it. No head of state would be permitted by their security details to do it  nor be in a position to do it. That's the difference  and the difference has to do with the character of cities themselves  because cities are profoundly multicultural  open  participatory  democratic  able to work with one another. When states face each other  China and the U.S.  they face each other like this. When cities interact  they interact like this. China and the U.S.  despite the recent meta meeting in California  are locked in all kinds of anger  resentment  and rivalry for number one. We heard more about who will be number one. Cities don't worry about number one. They have to work together  and they do work together. They work together in climate change  for example. Organizations like the C    like ICLEI  which I mentioned  have been working together many  many years before Copenhagen. In Copenhagen  four or five years ago      nations came together to explain to one another why their sovereignty didn't permit them to deal with the grave  grave crisis of climate change  but the mayor of Copenhagen had invited     mayors to attend. They came  they stayed  and they found ways and are still finding ways to work together  city to city  and through inter city organizations. Eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities  which means cities are in a position to solve the carbon problem  or most of it  whether or not the states of which they are a part make agreements with one another. And they are doing it. Los Angeles cleaned up its port  which was    percent of carbon emissions  and as a result got rid of about    percent of carbon. New York has a program to upgrade its old buildings  make them better insulated in the winter  to not leak energy in the summer  not leak air conditioning. That's having an impact. Bogota  where Mayor Mockus  when he was mayor  he introduced a transportation system that saved energy  that allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways  express buses with corridors. It helped unemployment  because people could get across town  and it had a profound impact on climate as well as many other things there. Singapore  as it developed its high rises and its remarkable public housing  also developed an island of parks  and if you go there  you'll see how much of it is green land and park land. Cities are doing this  but not just one by one. They are doing it together. They are sharing what they do  and they are making a difference by shared best practices. Bike shares  many of you have heard of it  started    or    years ago in Latin America. Now it's in hundreds of cities around the world. Pedestrian zones  congestion fees  emission limits in cities like California cities have  there's lots and lots that cities can do even when opaque  stubborn nations refuse to act. So what's the bottom line here  The bottom line is  we still live politically in a world of borders  a world of boundaries  a world of walls  a world where states refuse to act together. Yet we know that the reality we experience day to day is a world without borders  a world of diseases without borders and doctors without borders  maladies sans fronti res  M decins Sans Fronti res  of economics and technology without borders  of education without borders  of terrorism and war without borders. That is the real world  and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or democratize globalization  we will increasingly not only risk the failure to address all of these transnational problems  but we will risk losing democracy itself  locked up in the old nation state box  unable to address global problems democratically. So where does that leave us  I'll tell you. The road to global democracy doesn't run through states. It runs through cities. Democracy was born in the ancient polis. I believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis. In that journey from polis to cosmopolis  we can rediscover the power of democracy on a global level. We can create not a League of Nations  which failed  but a League of Cities  not a United or a dis United Nations  but United Cities of the World. We can create a global parliament of mayors. That's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world  but it's also on the table in City Halls in Seoul  Korea  in Amsterdam  in Hamburg  and in New York. Mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually constitute a global parliament of mayors  and I love that idea  because a parliament of mayors is a parliament of citizens and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us  of you and of me. If ever there were citizens without borders  I think it's the citizens of TED who show the promise to be those citizens without borders. I am ready to reach out and embrace a new global democracy  to take back our democracy. And the only question is  are you  Thank you so much  my fellow citizens. Thank you.  Applause  I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on involving a man named Steve Titus. Titus was a restaurant manager. He was    years old  he lived in Seattle  Washington  he was engaged to Gretchen  about to be married  she was the love of his life. And one night  the couple went out for a romantic restaurant meal. They were on their way home  and they were pulled over by a police officer. You see  Titus' car sort of resembled a car that was driven earlier in the evening by a man who raped a female hitchhiker  and Titus kind of resembled that rapist. So the police took a picture of Titus  they put it in a photo lineup  they later showed it to the victim  and she pointed to Titus' photo. She said   That one's the closest.  The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial  and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape  the rape victim got on the stand and said   I'm absolutely positive that's the man.  And Titus was convicted. He proclaimed his innocence  his family screamed at the jury  his fianc e collapsed on the floor sobbing  and Titus is taken away to jail. So what would you do at this point  What would you do  Well  Titus lost complete faith in the legal system  and yet he got an idea. He called up the local newspaper  he got the interest of an investigative journalist  and that journalist actually found the real rapist  a man who ultimately confessed to this rape  a man who was thought to have committed    rapes in that area  and when this information was given to the judge  the judge set Titus free. And really  that's where this case should have ended. It should have been over. Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year  a year of accusation and trial  but over. It didn't end that way. Titus was so bitter. He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back. He lost his fianc e. She couldn't put up with his persistent anger. He lost his entire savings  and so he decided to file a lawsuit against the police and others whom he felt were responsible for his suffering. And that's when I really started working on this case  trying to figure out how did that victim go from  That one's the closest  to  I'm absolutely positive that's the guy.  Well  Titus was consumed with his civil case. He spent every waking moment thinking about it  and just days before he was to have his day in court  he woke up in the morning  doubled over in pain  and died of a stress related heart attack. He was    years old. So I was asked to work on Titus' case because I'm a psychological scientist. I study memory. I've studied memory for decades. And if I meet somebody on an airplane    this happened on the way over to Scotland    if I meet somebody on an airplane  and we ask each other   What do you do  What do you do   and I say  I study memory   they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names  or they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's or some kind of memory problem  but I have to tell them I don't study when people forget. I study the opposite  when they remember  when they remember things that didn't happen or remember things that were different from the way they really were. I study false memories. Unhappily  Steve Titus is not the only person to be convicted based on somebody's false memory. In one project in the United States  information has been gathered on     innocent people      defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do. They spent            years in prison for these crimes  and now DNA testing has proven that they are actually innocent. And when those cases have been analyzed  three quarters of them are due to faulty memory  faulty eyewitness memory. Well  why  Like the jurors who convicted those innocent people and the jurors who convicted Titus  many people believe that memory works like a recording device. You just record the information  then you call it up and play it back when you want to answer questions or identify images. But decades of work in psychology has shown that this just isn't true. Our memories are constructive. They're reconstructive. Memory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page  You can go in there and change it  but so can other people. I first started studying this constructive memory process in the     s. I did my experiments that involved showing people simulated crimes and accidents and asking them questions about what they remember. In one study  we showed people a simulated accident and we asked people  how fast were the cars going when they hit each other  And we asked other people  how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other  And if we asked the leading  smashed  question  the witnesses told us the cars were going faster  and moreover  that leading  smashed  question caused people to be more likely to tell us that they saw broken glass in the accident scene when there wasn't any broken glass at all. In another study  we showed a simulated accident where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign  and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign  many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign at the intersection  not a stop sign. And you might be thinking  well  you know  these are filmed events  they are not particularly stressful. Would the same kind of mistakes be made with a really stressful event  In a study we published just a few months ago  we have an answer to this question  because what was unusual about this study is we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience. The subjects in this study were members of the U.S. military who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise to teach them what it's going to be like for them if they are ever captured as prisoners of war. And as part of this training exercise  these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive  hostile  physically abusive fashion for    minutes and later on they have to try to identify the person who conducted that interrogation. And when we feed them suggestive information that insinuates it's a different person  many of them misidentify their interrogator  often identifying someone who doesn't even remotely resemble the real interrogator. And so what these studies are showing is that when you feed people misinformation about some experience that they may have had  you can distort or contaminate or change their memory. Well out there in the real world  misinformation is everywhere. We get misinformation not only if we're questioned in a leading way  but if we talk to other witnesses who might consciously or inadvertently feed us some erroneous information  or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced  all of these provide the opportunity for this kind of contamination of our memory. In the     s  we began to see an even more extreme kind of memory problem. Some patients were going into therapy with one problem    maybe they had depression  an eating disorder    and they were coming out of therapy with a different problem. Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations  sometimes in satanic rituals  sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements. One woman came out of psychotherapy believing that she'd endured years of ritualistic abuse  where she was forced into a pregnancy and that the baby was cut from her belly. But there were no physical scars or any kind of physical evidence that could have supported her story. And when I began looking into these cases  I was wondering  where do these bizarre memories come from  And what I found is that most of these situations involved some particular form of psychotherapy. And so I asked  were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy    like the imagination exercises or dream interpretation  or in some cases hypnosis  or in some cases exposure to false information    were these leading these patients to develop these very bizarre  unlikely memories  And I designed some experiments to try to study the processes that were being used in this psychotherapy so I could study the development of these very rich false memories. In one of the first studies we did  we used suggestion  a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases  we used this kind of suggestion and planted a false memory that when you were a kid  five or six years old  you were lost in a shopping mall. You were frightened. You were crying. You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person and reunited with the family. And we succeeded in planting this memory in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects. And you might be thinking  well  that's not particularly stressful. But we and other investigators have planted rich false memories of things that were much more unusual and much more stressful. So in a study done in Tennessee  researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid  you nearly drowned and had to be rescued by a life guard. And in a study done in Canada  researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid  something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal happened to you  succeeding with about half of their subjects. And in a study done in Italy  researchers planted the false memory  when you were a kid  you witnessed demonic possession. I do want to add that it might seem like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects in the name of science  but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation by research ethics boards that have made the decision that the temporary discomfort that some of these subjects might experience in these studies is outweighed by the importance of this problem for understanding memory processes and the abuse of memory that is going on in some places in the world. Well  to my surprise  when I published this work and began to speak out against this particular brand of psychotherapy  it created some pretty bad problems for me  hostilities  primarily from the repressed memory therapists  who felt under attack  and by the patients whom they had influenced. I had sometimes armed guards at speeches that I was invited to give  people trying to drum up letter writing campaigns to get me fired. But probably the worst was I suspected that a woman was innocent of abuse that was being claimed by her grown daughter. She accused her mother of sexual abuse based on a repressed memory. And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story to be filmed and presented in public places. I was suspicious of this story  and so I started to investigate  and eventually found information that convinced me that this mother was innocent. I published an expos  on the case  and a little while later  the accusing daughter filed a lawsuit. Even though I'd never mentioned her name  she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy. And I went through nearly five years of dealing with this messy  unpleasant litigation  but finally  finally  it was over and I could really get back to my work. In the process  however  I became part of a disturbing trend in America where scientists are being sued for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy. When I got back to my work  I asked this question  if I plant a false memory in your mind  does it have repercussions  Does it affect your later thoughts  your later behaviors  Our first study planted a false memory that you got sick as a child eating certain foods  hard boiled eggs  dill pickles  strawberry ice cream. And we found that once we planted this false memory  people didn't want to eat the foods as much at an outdoor picnic. The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant. If we planted a warm  fuzzy memory involving a healthy food like asparagus  we could get people to want to eat asparagus more. And so what these studies are showing is that you can plant false memories and they have repercussions that affect behavior long after the memories take hold. Well  along with this ability to plant memories and control behavior obviously come some important ethical issues  like  when should we use this mind technology  And should we ever ban its use  Therapists can't ethically plant false memories in the mind of their patients even if it would help the patient  but there's nothing to stop a parent from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager. And when I suggested this publicly  it created an outcry again.  There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children.  Hello  Santa Claus.  Laughter  I mean  another way to think about this is  which would you rather have  a kid with obesity  diabetes  shortened lifespan  all the things that go with it  or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory  I know what I would choose for a kid of mine. But maybe my work has made me different from most people. Most people cherish their memories  know that they represent their identity  who they are  where they came from. And I appreciate that. I feel that way too. But I know from my work how much fiction is already in there. If I've learned anything from these decades of working on these problems  it's this  just because somebody tells you something and they say it with confidence  just because they say it with lots of detail  just because they express emotion when they say it  it doesn't mean that it really happened. We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories. We need independent corroboration. Such a discovery has made me more tolerant of the everyday memory mistakes that my friends and family members make. Such a discovery might have saved Steve Titus  the man whose whole future was snatched away by a false memory. But meanwhile  we should all keep in mind  we'd do well to  that memory  like liberty  is a fragile thing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thanks very much.  Applause  There is an ancient proverb that says it's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room  especially when there is no cat. I find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works    bumbling around in a dark room  bumping into things  trying to figure out what shape this might be  what that might be  there are reports of a cat somewhere around  they may not be reliable  they may be  and so forth and so on. Now I know this is different than the way most people think about science. Science  we generally are told  is a very well ordered mechanism for understanding the world  for gaining facts  for gaining data  that it's rule based  that scientists use this thing called the scientific method and we've been doing this for    generations or so now  and the scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard  cold facts out of the data. I'd like to tell you that's not the case. So there's the scientific method  but what's really going on is this.  Laughter   The Scientific Method vs. Farting Around  And it's going on kind of like that.  ... in the dark   Laughter  So what is the difference  then  between the way I believe science is pursued and the way it seems to be perceived  So this difference first came to me in some ways in my dual role at Columbia University  where I'm both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience where we try to figure out how the brain works. We do this by studying the sense of smell  the sense of olfaction  and in the laboratory  it's a great pleasure and fascinating work and exciting to work with graduate students and post docs and think up cool experiments to understand how this sense of smell works and how the brain might be working  and  well  frankly  it's kind of exhilarating. But at the same time  it's my responsibility to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain  and that's a big subject  and it takes quite a while to organize that  and it's quite challenging and it's quite interesting  but I have to say  it's not so exhilarating. So what was the difference  Well  the course I was and am teaching is called Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience   I.  Laughs  It's    lectures full of all sorts of facts  it uses this giant book called  Principles of Neural Science  by three famous neuroscientists. This book comes in at       pages  it weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds. Just to put that in some perspective  that's the weight of two normal human brains. So I began to realize  by the end of this course  that the students maybe were getting the idea that we must know everything there is to know about the brain. That's clearly not true. And they must also have this idea  I suppose  that what scientists do is collect data and collect facts and stick them in these big books. And that's not really the case either. When I go to a meeting  after the meeting day is over and we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues  we never talk about what we know. We talk about what we don't know. We talk about what still has to get done  what's so critical to get done in the lab. Indeed  this was  I think  best said by Marie Curie who said that one never notices what has been done but only what remains to be done. This was in a letter to her brother after obtaining her second graduate degree  I should say. I have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie  because I am convinced that that glow behind her is not a photographic effect.  Laughter  That's the real thing. It is true that her papers are  to this day  stored in a basement room in the Biblioth que Fran aise in a concrete room that's lead lined  and if you're a scholar and you want access to these notebooks  you have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit  so it's pretty scary business. Nonetheless  this is what I think we were leaving out of our courses and leaving out of the interaction that we have with the public as scientists  the what remains to be done. This is the stuff that's exhilarating and interesting. It is  if you will  the ignorance. That's what was missing. So I thought  well  maybe I should teach a course on ignorance  something I can finally excel at  perhaps  for example. So I did start teaching this course on ignorance  and it's been quite interesting and I'd like to tell you to go to the website. You can find all sorts of information there. It's wide open. And it's been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about what it is they don't know. Now I use this word  ignorance   of course  to be at least in part intentionally provocative  because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and I clearly don't mean any of those. So I don't mean stupidity  I don't mean a callow indifference to fact or reason or data. The ignorant are clearly unenlightened  unaware  uninformed  and present company today excepted  often occupy elected offices  it seems to me. That's another story  perhaps. I mean a different kind of ignorance. I mean a kind of ignorance that's less pejorative  a kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge  something that's just not there to be known or isn't known well enough yet or we can't make predictions from  the kind of ignorance that's maybe best summed up in a statement by James Clerk Maxwell  perhaps the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein  who said   Thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real advance in science.  I think it's a wonderful idea  thoroughly conscious ignorance. So that's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today  but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts  So it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate. We all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts  this accumulation model of science  as many have called it  and it seems impregnable  it seems impossible. How can you ever know all of this  And indeed  the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate. In       there were  .  million papers published. There's about a two and a half percent yearly growth rate  and so last year we saw over one and a half million papers being published. Divide that by the number of minutes in a year  and you wind up with three new papers per minute. So I've been up here a little over    minutes  I've already lost three papers. I have to get out of here actually. I have to go read. So what do we do about this  Well  the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect  if you will. We just don't worry about it  in a way. The facts are important. You have to know a lot of stuff to be a scientist. That's true. But knowing a lot of stuff doesn't make you a scientist. You need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter. But in science  knowing a lot of stuff is not the point. Knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get to more ignorance. So knowledge is a big subject  but I would say ignorance is a bigger one. So this leads us to maybe think about  a little bit about  some of the models of science that we tend to use  and I'd like to disabuse you of some of them. So one of them  a popular one  is that scientists are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together to reveal some grand scheme or another. This is clearly not true. For one  with puzzles  the manufacturer has guaranteed that there's a solution. We don't have any such guarantee. Indeed  there are many of us who aren't so sure about the manufacturer. So I think the puzzle model doesn't work. Another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things the way you unravel the peels of an onion. So peel by peel  you take away the layers of the onion to get at some fundamental kernel of truth. I don't think that's the way it works either. Another one  a kind of popular one  is the iceberg idea  that we only see the tip of the iceberg but underneath is where most of the iceberg is hidden. But all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts that we can somehow or another get completed. We can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is  or we could just wait for it to melt  I suppose  these days  but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg. Right  Or make it manageable. But I don't think that's the case. I think what really happens in science is a model more like the magic well  where no matter how many buckets you take out  there's always another bucket of water to be had  or my particularly favorite one  with the effect and everything  the ripples on a pond. So if you think of knowledge being this ever expanding ripple on a pond  the important thing to realize is that our ignorance  the circumference of this knowledge  also grows with knowledge. So the knowledge generates ignorance. This is really well said  I thought  by George Bernard Shaw. This is actually part of a toast that he delivered to celebrate Einstein at a dinner celebrating Einstein's work  in which he claims that science just creates more questions than it answers.   Science is always wrong. It never solves a problem without creating    more.   I find that kind of glorious  and I think he's precisely right  plus it's a kind of job security. As it turns out  he kind of cribbed that from the philosopher Immanuel Kant who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea of question propagation  that every answer begets more questions. I love that term   question propagation   this idea of questions propagating out there. So I'd say the model we want to take is not that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together and then we gain knowledge. It's rather kind of the other way around  really. What do we use this knowledge for  What are we using this collection of facts for  We're using it to make better ignorance  to come up with  if you will  higher quality ignorance. Because  you know  there's low quality ignorance and there's high quality ignorance. It's not all the same. Scientists argue about this all the time. Sometimes we call them bull sessions. Sometimes we call them grant proposals. But nonetheless  it's what the argument is about. It's the ignorance. It's the what we don't know. It's what makes a good question. So how do we think about these questions  I'm going to show you a graph that shows up quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments. This graph asks the relationship between what you know and how much you know about it. So what you know  you can know anywhere from nothing to everything  of course  and how much you know about it can be anywhere from a little to a lot. So let's put a point on the graph. There's an undergraduate. Doesn't know much but they have a lot of interest. They're interested in almost everything. Now you look at a master's student  a little further along in their education  and you see they know a bit more  but it's been narrowed somewhat. And finally you get your Ph.D.  where it turns out you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing.  Laughter  What's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that because  of course  when it dips below the zero axis  there  it gets into a negative area. That's where you find people like me  I'm afraid. So the important thing here is that this can all be changed. This whole view can be changed by just changing the label on the x axis. So instead of how much you know about it  we could say   What can you ask about it   So yes  you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist  but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff is not just to know a lot of stuff. That just makes you a geek  right  Knowing a lot of stuff  the purpose is to be able to ask lots of questions  to be able to frame thoughtful  interesting questions  because that's where the real work is. Let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions. I'm a neuroscientist  so how would we come up with a question in neuroscience  Because it's not always quite so straightforward. So  for example  we could say  well what is it that the brain does  Well  one thing the brain does  it moves us around. We walk around on two legs. That seems kind of simple  somehow or another. I mean  virtually everybody over    months of age walks around on two legs  right  So that maybe is not that interesting. So instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at. How about the visual system  There it is  the visual system. I mean  we love our visual systems. We do all kinds of cool stuff. Indeed  there are over        neuroscientists who work on the visual system  from the retina to the visual cortex  in an attempt to understand not just the visual system but to also understand how general principles of how the brain might work. But now here's the thing  Our technology has actually been pretty good at replicating what the visual system does. We have TV  we have movies  we have animation  we have photography  we have pattern recognition  all of these sorts of things. They work differently than our visual systems in some cases  but nonetheless we've been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system. Somehow or another  a hundred years of robotics  you never saw a robot walk on two legs  because robots don't walk on two legs because it's not such an easy thing to do. A hundred years of robotics  and we can't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other. You ask them to go up an inclined plane  and they fall over. Turn around  and they fall over. It's a serious problem. So what is it that's the most difficult thing for a brain to do  What ought we to be studying  Perhaps it ought to be walking on two legs  or the motor system. I'll give you an example from my own lab  my own particularly smelly question  since we work on the sense of smell. But here's a diagram of five molecules and sort of a chemical notation. These are just plain old molecules  but if you sniff those molecules up these two little holes in the front of your face  you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose. If there's a real rose there  those molecules will be the ones  but even if there's no rose there  you'll have the memory of a molecule. How do we turn molecules into perceptions  What's the process by which that could happen  Here's another example  two very simple molecules  again in this kind of chemical notation. It might be easier to visualize them this way  so the gray circles are carbon atoms  the white ones are hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms. Now these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom and two little hydrogen atoms that ride along with it  and yet one of them  heptyl acetate  has the distinct odor of a pear  and hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana. So there are two really interesting questions here  it seems to me. One is  how can a simple little molecule like that create a perception in your brain that's so clear as a pear or a banana  And secondly  how the hell can we tell the difference between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom  I mean  that's remarkable to me  clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet. And you don't even think about it  do you  So this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us back to the ignorance and the idea of questions. I like to quote because I think dead people shouldn't be excluded from the conversation. And I also think it's important to realize that the conversation's been going on for a while  by the way. So Erwin Schrodinger  a great quantum physicist and  I think  philosopher  points out how you have to  abide by ignorance for an indefinite period  of time. And it's this abiding by ignorance that I think we have to learn how to do. This is a tricky thing. This is not such an easy business. I guess it comes down to our education system  so I'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education  because I think that's where it really has to play out. So for one  let's face it  in the age of Google and Wikipedia  the business model of the university and probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change. We just can't sell facts for a living anymore. They're available with a click of the mouse  or if you want to  you could probably just ask the wall one of these days  wherever they're going to hide the things that tell us all this stuff. So what do we have to do  We have to give our students a taste for the boundaries  for what's outside that circumference  for what's outside the facts  what's just beyond the facts. How do we do that  Well  one of the problems  of course  turns out to be testing. We currently have an educational system which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing. So in second grade  all the kids are interested in science  the girls and the boys. They like to take stuff apart. They have great curiosity. They like to investigate things. They go to science museums. They like to play around. They're in second grade. They're interested. But by   th or   th grade  fewer than    percent of them have any interest in science whatsoever  let alone a desire to go into science as a career. So we have this remarkably efficient system for beating any interest in science out of everybody's head. Is this what we want  I think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine calls  the bulimic method of education.  You know. You can imagine what it is. We just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here and then they puke it up on an exam over here and everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever. This can't possibly continue to go on. So what do we do  Well the geneticists  I have to say  have an interesting maxim they live by. Geneticists always say  you always get what you screen for. And that's meant as a warning. So we always will get what we screen for  and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods. Well  we hear a lot about testing and evaluation  and we have to think carefully when we're testing whether we're evaluating or whether we're weeding  whether we're weeding people out  whether we're making some cut. Evaluation is one thing. You hear a lot about evaluation in the literature these days  in the educational literature  but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts to an opportunity for trial and error. It amounts to a chance to work over a longer period of time with this kind of feedback. That's different than weeding  and usually  I have to tell you  when people talk about evaluation  evaluating students  evaluating teachers  evaluating schools  evaluating programs  that they're really talking about weeding. And that's a bad thing  because then you will get what you select for  which is what we've gotten so far. So I'd say what we need is a test that says   What is x   and the answers are  I don't know  because no one does   or  What's the question   Even better. Or   You know what  I'll look it up  I'll ask someone  I'll phone someone. I'll find out.  Because that's what we want people to do  and that's how you evaluate them. And maybe for the advanced placement classes  it could be   Here's the answer. What's the next question   That's the one I like in particular. So let me end with a quote from William Butler Yeats  who said  Education is not about filling buckets  it is lighting fires.  So I'd say  let's get out the matches. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  So I'm going to talk about trust  and I'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust. I think these are so commonplace  they've become clich s of our society. And I think there are three. One's a claim  there has been a great decline in trust  very widely believed. The second is an aim  we should have more trust. And the third is a task  we should rebuild trust. I think that the claim  the aim and the task are all misconceived. So what I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim  an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter. First the claim  Why do people think trust has declined  And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence  I don't know the answer. I'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others. I don't have an overview. But  of course  I can look at the opinion polls  and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined. When you actually look at opinion polls across time  there's not much evidence for that. That's to say  the people who were mistrusted    years ago  principally journalists and politicians  are still mistrusted. And the people who were highly trusted    years ago are still rather highly trusted  judges  nurses. The rest of us are in between  and by the way  the average person in the street is almost exactly midway. But is that good evidence  What opinion polls record is  of course  opinions. What else can they record  So they're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions. Do you trust politicians  Do you trust teachers  Now if somebody said to you   Do you trust greengrocers  Do you trust fishmongers  Do you trust elementary school teachers   you would probably begin by saying   To do what   And that would be a perfectly sensible response. And you might say  when you understood the answer to that   Well  I trust some of them  but not others.  That's a perfectly rational thing. In short  in our real lives  we seek to place trust in a differentiated way. We don't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office holder or type of person is going to be uniform. I might  for example  say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to teach the reception class to read  but in no way to drive the school minibus. I might  after all  know that she wasn't a good driver. I might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not    but perhaps not to keep a secret. Simple. So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated  why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly  I think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists  because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust. Secondly  what about the aim  The aim is to have more trust. Well frankly  I think that's a stupid aim. It's not what I would aim at. I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy. In fact  I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy. And I think  of those people who  for example  placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff  who then made off with them  and I think of them  and I think  well  yes  too much trust. More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life. Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim. Well once one says that  one says  yeah  okay  that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness. It's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects. And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things. Are they competent  Are they honest  Are they reliable  And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters  and reliable and honest  we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them  because they'll be trustworthy. But if  on the other hand  they're unreliable  we might not. I have friends who are competent and honest  but I would not trust them to post a letter  because they're forgetful. I have friends who are very confident they can do certain things  but I realize that they overestimate their own competence. And I'm very glad to say  I don't think I have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest. If so  I haven't yet spotted it. But that's what we're looking for  trustworthiness before trust. Trust is the response. Trustworthiness is what we have to judge. And  of course  it's difficult. Across the last few decades  we've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness. A lot of these systems have the converse effect. They don't work as they're supposed to. I remember I was talking with a midwife who said   Well  you see  the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby.  And all over our public life  our institutional life  we find that problem  that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite. It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks  like midwives  from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes  as we say. You can all give your own examples there. So so much for the aim. The aim  I think  is more trustworthiness  and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people  and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office holders or politicians are trustworthy. It's not easy. It is judgment  and simple reaction  attitudes  don't do adequately here. Now thirdly  the task. Calling the task rebuilding trust  I think  also gets things backwards. It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust. Well  we can do that for ourselves. We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness. We can do it two people together trying to improve trust. But trust  in the end  is distinctive because it's given by other people. You can't rebuild what other people give you. You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust. So you have to  I think  be trustworthy. And that  of course  is because you can't fool all of the people all of the time  usually. But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy. How to do it  Well every day  all over the place  it's being done by ordinary people  by officials  by institutions  quite effectively. Let me give you a simple commercial example. The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back  and they don't ask any questions. They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted. That's super. I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me. I think there's a big lesson in that. If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party  then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying. So in the end  I think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern. It is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy. So the moral of all this is  we need to think much less about trust  let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis detected by opinion polls  much more about being trustworthy  and how you give people adequate  useful and simple evidence that you're trustworthy. Thanks. We are going to take a quick voyage over the cognitive history of the   th century  because during that century  our minds have altered dramatically. As you all know  the cars that people drove in      have altered because the roads are better and because of technology. And our minds have altered  too. We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world  and it's a world where we've had to develop new mental habits  new habits of mind. And these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification  introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent  and also taking the hypothetical seriously  that is  wondering about what might have been rather than what is. Now  this dramatic change was drawn to my attention through massive I.Q. gains over time  and these have been truly massive. That is  we don't just get a few more questions right on I.Q. tests. We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented. Indeed  if you score the people a century ago against modern norms  they would have an average I.Q. of   . If you score us against their norms  we would have an average I.Q. of    . Now this has raised all sorts of questions. Were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation  Because    is normally the score for mental retardation. Or are we on the verge of all being gifted  Because     is the cutting line for giftedness. Now I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative that's much more illuminating than either of those  and to put this into perspective  let's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth and found a ruined civilization. And this Martian was an archaeologist  and they found scores  target scores  that people had used for shooting. And first they looked at       and they found that in a minute  people had only put one bullet in the bullseye. And then they found  in       that they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute. And then about      they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye. And initially  that archaeologist would be baffled. They would say  look  these tests were designed to find out how much people were steady of hand  how keen their eyesight was  whether they had control of their weapon. How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree  Well we now know  of course  the answer. If that Martian looked at battlefields  they would find that people had only muskets at the time of the Civil War and that they had repeating rifles at the time of the Spanish American War  and then they had machine guns by the time of World War I. And  in other words  it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible  not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of hand. Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery that we have picked up over those hundred years  and I think again that another thinker will help us here  and that's Luria. Luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age  and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world. They wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use. He found that they were resistant to deducing the hypothetical  to speculating about what might be  and he found finally that they didn't deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions. Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews. He talked to the head man of a person in rural Russia. They'd only had  as people had in       about four years of schooling. And he asked that particular person  what do crows and fish have in common  And the fellow said   Absolutely nothing. You know  I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow. A crow can peck at a fish. A fish can't do anything to a crow.  And Luria said   But aren't they both animals   And he said   Of course not. One's a fish. The other is a bird.  And he was interested  effectively  in what he could do with those concrete objects. And then Luria went to another person  and he said to them   There are no camels in Germany. Hamburg is a city in Germany. Are there camels in Hamburg   And the fellow said   Well  if it's large enough  there ought to be camels there.  And Luria said   But what do my words imply   And he said   Well  maybe it's a small village  and there's no room for camels.  In other words  he was unwilling to treat this as anything but a concrete problem  and he was used to camels being in villages  and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical  to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany. A third interview was conducted with someone about the North Pole. And Luria said   At the North Pole  there is always snow. Wherever there is always snow  the bears are white. What color are the bears at the North Pole   And the response was   Such a thing is to be settled by testimony. If a wise person came from the North Pole and told me the bears were white  I might believe him  but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear.  Now you see again  this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience  and it was important to that person what color bears were    that is  they had to hunt bears. They weren't willing to engage in this. One of them said to Luria   How can we solve things that aren't real problems  None of these problems are real. How can we address them   Now  these three categories    classification  using logic on abstractions  taking the hypothetical seriously    how much difference do they make in the real world beyond the testing room  And let me give you a few illustrations. First  almost all of us today get a high school diploma. That is  we've gone from four to eight years of education to    years of formal education  and    percent of Americans have actually experienced some type of tertiary education. Now  not only do we have much more education  and much of that education is scientific  and you can't do science without classifying the world. You can't do science without proposing hypotheses. You can't do science without making it logically consistent. And even down in grade school  things have changed. In       they looked at the examinations that the state of Ohio gave to    year olds  and they found that they were all for socially valued concrete information. They were things like  what are the capitals of the    or    states that existed at that time  When they looked at the exams that the state of Ohio gave in       they were all about abstractions. They were things like  why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital  And you were supposed to think  well  the state legislature was rural controlled  and they hated the big city  so rather than putting the capital in a big city  they put it in a county seat. They put it in Albany rather than New York. They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia. And so forth. So the tenor of education has changed. We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously  to use abstractions  and to link them logically. What about employment  Well  in       three percent of Americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding. Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers. Today     percent of Americans practice cognitively demanding professions  not only to the professions proper like lawyer or doctor or scientist or lecturer  but many  many sub professions having to do with being a technician  a computer programmer. A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands. And we can only meet the terms of employment in the modern world by being cognitively far more flexible. And it's not just that we have many more people in cognitively demanding professions. The professions have been upgraded. Compare the doctor in       who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve  with the modern general practitioner or specialist  with years of scientific training. Compare the banker in       who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage. Well  the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees may have been morally remiss  but they were cognitively very agile. They went far beyond that      banker. They had to look at computer projections for the housing market. They had to get complicated CDO squared in order to bundle debt together and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset. They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a AAA  though in many cases  they had virtually bribed the rating agencies. And they also  of course  had to get people to accept these so called assets and pay money for them even though they were highly vulnerable. Or take a farmer today. I take the farm manager of today as very different from the farmer of     . So it hasn't just been the spread of cognitively demanding professions. It's also been the upgrading of tasks like lawyer and doctor and what have you that have made demands on our cognitive faculties. But I've talked about education and employment. Some of the habits of mind that we have developed over the   th century have paid off in unexpected areas. I'm primarily a moral philosopher. I merely have a holiday in psychology  and what interests me in general is moral debate. Now over the last century  in developed nations like America  moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously  and we also take universals seriously and look for logical connections. When I came home in      from university at the time of Martin Luther King  a lot of people came home at that time and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents. My father was born in       and he was mildly racially biased. As an Irishman  he hated the English so much he didn't have much emotion for anyone else. But he did have a sense that black people were inferior. And when we said to our parents and grandparents   How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black   they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said. Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning    that turned black  In other words  they were fixed in the concrete mores and attitudes they had inherited. They would not take the hypothetical seriously  and without the hypothetical  it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground. You have to say  imagine you were in Iran  and imagine that your relatives all suffered from collateral damage even though they had done no wrong. How would you feel about that  And if someone of the older generation says  well  our government takes care of us  and it's up to their government to take care of them  they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously. Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped  and he feels he's honor bound to kill her. Well  he's treating his mores as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited  and they're unmovable in any way by logic. They're just inherited mores. Today we would say something like  well  imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized. Would you deserve to be killed  And he would say  well that's not in the Koran. That's not one of the principles I've got. Well you  today  universalize your principles. You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them. If you have a principle such as  people shouldn't suffer unless they're guilty of something  then to exclude black people you've got to make exceptions  don't you  You have to say  well  blackness of skin  you couldn't suffer just for that. It must be that blacks are somehow tainted. And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear  can't we  and say  well how can you consider all blacks tainted when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black. And you can get moral argument off the ground  then  because you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities. You're treating them as universals  to be rendered consistent by logic. Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests  That's what initially got me going on cognitive history. If you look at the I.Q. test  you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas. The similarities subtest of the Wechsler is about classification  and we have made enormous gains on that classification subtest. There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery that are about using logic on abstractions. Some of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices  and it's all about analogies. And in       people could do simple analogies. That is  if you said to them  cats are like wildcats. What are dogs like  They would say wolves. But by       people could attack Raven's on a much more sophisticated level. If you said  we've got two squares followed by a triangle  what follows two circles  They could say a semicircle. Just as a triangle is half of a square  a semicircle is half of a circle. By       college graduates  if you said two circles followed by a semicircle  two sixteens followed by what  they would say eight  because eight is half of   . That is  they had moved so far from the concrete world that they could even ignore the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question. Now  I should say one thing that's very disheartening. We haven't made progress on all fronts. One of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through politics  and sadly you can have humane moral principles  you can classify  you can use logic on abstractions  and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries  you can't do politics. We've noticed  in a trend among young Americans  that they read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands  and they're essentially ahistorical. They live in the bubble of the present. They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam. They don't know who was an ally of America in World War II. Think how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fifth time Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order  and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions. And that is  they had barely left  and there wasn't a trace in the sand. Or imagine how different things would be if most Americans knew that we had been lied into four of our last six wars. You know  the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine  the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions  the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet  and  of course  Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda and had nothing to do with it  and yet the administration convinced    percent of the people that they were brothers in arms  when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost. But I don't want to end on a pessimistic note. The   th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves in ordinary people that we have now realized  and the aristocracy was convinced that the average person couldn't make it  that they could never share their mindset or their cognitive abilities. Lord Curzon once said he saw people bathing in the North Sea  and he said   Why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have   As if they were a reptile. Well  Dickens was right and he was wrong.  Correction  Rudyard Kipling   Kipling  said   The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters underneath the skin.  For a long time in my life  I felt like I'd been living two different lives. There's the life that everyone sees  and then there's the life that only I see. And in the life that everyone sees  who I am is a friend  a son  a brother  a stand up comedian and a teenager. That's the life everyone sees. If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me  that's what they would tell you. And that's a huge part of me. That is who I am. And if you were to ask me to describe myself  I'd probably say some of those same things. And I wouldn't be lying  but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth  either  because the truth is  that's just the life everyone else sees. In the life that only I see  who I am  who I really am  is someone who struggles intensely with depression. I have for the last six years of my life  and I continue to every day. Now  for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn't really know what that means  that might surprise them to hear  because there's this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong  when you break up with your girlfriend  when you lose a loved one  when you don't get the job you wanted. But that's sadness. That's a natural thing. That's a natural human emotion. Real depression isn't being sad when something in your life goes wrong. Real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right. That's real depression  and that's what I suffer from. And to be totally honest  that's hard for me to stand up here and say. It's hard for me to talk about  and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about  so much so that no one's talking about it. And no one's talking about depression  but we need to be  because right now it's a massive problem. It's a massive problem. But we don't see it on social media  right  We don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter. We don't see it on the news  because it's not happy  it's not fun  it's not light. And so because we don't see it  we don't see the severity of it. But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this  every    seconds  every    seconds  somewhere  someone in the world takes their own life because of depression  and it might be two blocks away  it might be two countries away  it might be two continents away  but it's happening  and it's happening every single day. And we have a tendency  as a society  to look at that and go   So what   So what  We look at that  and we go   That's your problem. That's their problem.  We say we're sad and we say we're sorry  but we also say   So what   Well  two years ago it was my problem  because I sat on the edge of my bed where I'd sat a million times before and I was suicidal. I was suicidal  and if you were to look at my life on the surface  you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal. You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team  the drama and theater student of the year  the English student of the year  someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party. So you would say I wasn't depressed  you would say I wasn't suicidal  but you would be wrong. You would be wrong. So I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and I thought about taking my own life and I came this close to doing it. I came this close to doing it. And I didn't  so that makes me one of the lucky ones  one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump  one of the lucky ones who survives. Well  I survived  and that just leaves me with my story  and my story is this  In four simple words  I suffer from depression. I suffer from depression  and for a long time  I think  I was living two totally different lives  where one person was always afraid of the other. I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was  that I wasn't the perfect  popular kid in high school everyone thought I was  that beneath my smile  there was struggle  and beneath my light  there was dark  and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain. See  some people might fear girls not liking them back. Some people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death. But for me  for a large part of my life  I feared myself. I feared my truth  I feared my honesty  I feared my vulnerability  and that fear made me feel like I was forced into a corner  like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out  and so I thought about that way every single day. I thought about it every single day  and if I'm being totally honest  standing here I've thought about it again since  because that's the sickness  that's the struggle  that's depression  and depression isn't chicken pox. You don't beat it once and it's gone forever. It's something you live with. It's something you live in. It's the roommate you can't kick out. It's the voice you can't ignore. It's the feelings you can't seem to escape  the scariest part is that after a while  you become numb to it. It becomes normal for you  and what you really fear the most isn't the suffering inside of you. It's the stigma inside of others  it's the shame  it's the embarrassment  it's the disapproving look on a friend's face  it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak  it's the comments that you're crazy. That's what keeps you from getting help. That's what makes you hold it in and hide it. It's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it  and you hold it in and you hide it  and even though it's keeping you in bed every day and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it  you hide it  because the stigma in our society around depression is very real. It's very real  and if you think that it isn't  ask yourself this  Would you rather make your next Facebook status say you're having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you're depressed  That's the stigma  because unfortunately  we live in a world where if you break your arm  everyone runs over to sign your cast  but if you tell people you're depressed  everyone runs the other way. That's the stigma. We are so  so  so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains. And that's ignorance. That's pure ignorance  and that ignorance has created a world that doesn't understand depression  that doesn't understand mental health. And that's ironic to me  because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world  yet it's one of the least discussed. We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself. Well  it won't. It hasn't  and it's not going to  because that's wishful thinking  and wishful thinking isn't a game plan  it's procrastination  and we can't procrastinate on something this important. The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. Well  we haven't done that  so we can't really expect to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question. And I don't know what the solution is. I wish I did  but I don't    but I think  I think it has to start here. It has to start with me  it has to start with you  it has to start with the people who are suffering  the ones who are hidden in the shadows. We need to speak up and shatter the silence. We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in  because if there's one thing that I've come to realize  if there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem  it's not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others. It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves  where we're okay with who we are  because when we get honest  we see that we all struggle and we all suffer. Whether it's with this  whether it's with something else  we all know what it is to hurt. We all know what it is to have pain in our heart  and we all know how important it is to heal. But right now  depression is society's deep cut that we're content to put a Band Aid over and pretend it's not there. Well  it is there. It is there  and you know what  It's okay. Depression is okay. If you're going through it  know that you're okay. And know that you're sick  you're not weak  and it's an issue  not an identity  because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others  you can see depression for what it really is  and that's just a part of life  just a part of life  and as much as I hate  as much as I hate some of the places  some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to  in a lot of ways I'm grateful for it. Because yeah  it's put me in the valleys  but only to show me there's peaks  and yeah it's dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light. My pain  more than anything in    years on this planet  has given me perspective  and my hurt  my hurt has forced me to have hope  have hope and to have faith  faith in myself  faith in others  faith that it can get better  that we can change this  that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance  fight back against intolerance  and more than anything  learn to love ourselves  learn to accept ourselves for who we are  the people we are  not the people the world wants us to be. Because the world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark. The world I believe in is one where we're measured by our ability to overcome adversities  not avoid them. The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say   I'm going through hell   and they can look back at me and go   Me too   and that's okay  and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people. We're people  and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry  and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness  then I'm here to tell you you're wrong. You're wrong  because it's the opposite. We're people  and we have problems. We're not perfect  and that's okay. So we need to stop the ignorance  stop the intolerance  stop the stigma  and stop the silence  and we need to take away the taboos  take a look at the truth  and start talking  because the only way we're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together  by standing strong together. And I believe that we can. I believe that we can. Thank you guys so much. This is a dream come true. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  So I wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book  and it's a story of something that happened       years ago  when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy. And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel. And the reason the story obsessed me is that I thought I understood it  and then I went back over it and I realized that I didn't understand it at all. Ancient Palestine had a    along its eastern border  there's a mountain range. Still same is true of Israel today. And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region  so Jerusalem  Bethlehem  Hebron. And then there's a coastal plain along the Mediterranean  where Tel Aviv is now. And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the Shephelah  which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west  and you can follow the Shephelah  go through the Shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains. And the Shephelah  if you've been to Israel  you'll know it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel. It's gorgeous  with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards. But more importantly  though  in the history of that region  it's served  it's had a real strategic function  and that is  it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way  get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains. And       years ago  that's exactly what happens. The Philistines  who are the biggest of enemies of the Kingdom of Israel  are living in the coastal plain. They're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people. And they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the Shephelah up into the mountains  because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two. And the Kingdom of Israel  which is headed by King Saul  obviously catches wind of this  and Saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah  one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah. And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge  and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge  and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other  because they're deadlocked. Neither can attack the other  because to attack the other side you've got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side  and you're completely exposed. So finally  to break the deadlock  the Philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor  and he calls out and he says to the Israelites   Send your mightiest warrior down  and we'll have this out  just the two of us.  This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat. It was a way of settling disputes without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle. And the Philistine who is sent down  their mighty warrior  is a giant. He's   foot  . He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor  and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin and he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying. And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him. It's a death wish  right  There's no way they think they can take him. And finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy  and he goes up to Saul and he says   I'll fight him.  And Saul says   You can't fight him. That's ridiculous. You're this kid. This is this mighty warrior.  But the shepherd is adamant. He says   No  no  no  you don't understand  I have been defending my flock against lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it.  And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward. So he says   All right.  And then he turns to the kid  and he says   But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are.  So he tries to give the shepherd his armor  and the shepherd says   No.  He says   I can't wear this stuff.  The Biblical verse is   I cannot wear this for I have not proved it   meaning   I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy.  So he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd's bag and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant. And the giant sees this figure approaching  and calls out   Come to me so I can feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field.  He issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him. And the shepherd draws closer and closer  and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff. That's all he's carrying. Instead of a weapon  just this shepherd's staff  and he says    he's insulted     Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks   And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket  puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes    right here  in his most vulnerable spot    and he falls down either dead or unconscious  and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head  and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run. And of course  the name of the giant is Goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is David  and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything I thought I knew about that story turned out to be wrong. So David  in that story  is supposed to be the underdog  right  In fact  that term  David and Goliath  has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger. Now why do we call David an underdog  Well  we call him an underdog because he's a kid  a little kid  and Goliath is this big  strong giant. We also call him an underdog because Goliath is an experienced warrior  and David is just a shepherd. But most importantly  we call him an underdog because all he has is    it's that Goliath is outfitted with all of this modern weaponry  this glittering coat of armor and a sword and a javelin and a spear  and all David has is this sling. Well  let's start there with the phrase  All David has is this sling   because that's the first mistake that we make. In ancient warfare  there are three kinds of warriors. There's cavalry  men on horseback and with chariots. There's heavy infantry  which are foot soldiers  armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor. And there's artillery  and artillery are archers  but  more importantly  slingers. And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it  and they put a projectile  either a rock or a lead ball  inside the pouch  and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go  and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target. That's what David has  and it's important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot. It's not this  right  It's not a child's toy. It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon. When David rolls it around like this  he's turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second  and that means that when the rock is released  it's going forward really fast  probably    meters per second. That's substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers. More than that  the stones in the Valley of Elah were not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate  which are rocks twice the density of normal stones. If you do the calculations on the ballistics  on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling  it's roughly equal to the stopping power of a  .   caliber  handgun. This is an incredibly devastating weapon. Accuracy  we know from historical records that slingers    experienced slingers could hit and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to     yards. From medieval tapestries  we know that slingers were capable of hitting birds in flight. They were incredibly accurate. When David lines up    and he's not     yards away from Goliath  he's quite close to Goliath    when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath  he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes. If you go back over the history of ancient warfare  you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another. So what's Goliath  He's heavy infantry  and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman. When he says   Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field   the key phrase is  Come to me.  Come up to me because we're going to fight  hand to hand  like this. Saul has the same expectation. David says   I want to fight Goliath   and Saul tries to give him his armor  because Saul is thinking   Oh  when you say 'fight Goliath ' you mean 'fight him in hand to hand combat ' infantry on infantry.  But David has absolutely no expectation. He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he  He's a shepherd. He's spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves. That's where his strength lies. So here he is  this shepherd  experienced in the use of a devastating weapon  up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short range combat. Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance. So why do we keep calling David an underdog  and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable  There's a second piece of this that's important. It's not just that we misunderstand David and his choice of weaponry. It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath. Goliath is not what he seems to be. There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text  things that are in retrospect quite puzzling and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior. So to begin with  the Bible says that Goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant. Now that is weird  right  Here is this mighty warrior challenging the Israelites to one on one combat. Why is he being led by the hand by some young boy  presumably  to the point of combat  Secondly  the Bible story makes special note of how slowly Goliath moves  another odd thing to say when you're describing the mightiest warrior known to man at that point. And then there's this whole weird thing about how long it takes Goliath to react to the sight of David. So David's coming down the mountain  and he's clearly not preparing for hand to hand combat. There is nothing about him that says   I am about to fight you like this.  He's not even carrying a sword. Why does Goliath not react to that  It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day. And then there's that strange comment he makes to David   Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks   Sticks  David only has one stick. Well  it turns out that there's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with Goliath  an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies. There have been many articles written. The first one was in      in the Indiana Medical Journal  and it started a chain of speculation that starts with an explanation for Goliath's height. So Goliath is head and shoulders above all of his peers in that era  and usually when someone is that far out of the norm  there's an explanation for it. So the most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly  and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone. And throughout history  many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly. So the tallest person of all time was a guy named Robert Wadlow who was still growing when he died at the age of    and he was   foot   . He had acromegaly. Do you remember the wrestler Andr  the Giant  Famous. He had acromegaly. There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly. Anyone who's unusually tall  that's the first explanation we come up with. And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it  principally having to do with vision. The pituitary tumor  as it grows  often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain  with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted. So when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with Goliath  they've said   Wait a minute  he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly.  And that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day. Why does he move so slowly and have to be escorted down into the valley floor by an attendant  Because he can't make his way on his own. Why is he so strangely oblivious to David that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him until the very last moment  Because he can't see him. When he says   Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field   the phrase  come to me  is a hint also of his vulnerability. Come to me because I can't see you. And then there's   Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks   He sees two sticks when David has only one. So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe. What they didn't understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness. And there is  I think  in that  a very important lesson for all of us. Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem. And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket. Thank you.
