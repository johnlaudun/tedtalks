A hundred years ago this month  a    year old Albert Einstein stood up in front of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin to present a radical new theory of space  time and gravity  the general theory of relativity. General relativity is unquestionably Einstein's masterpiece  a theory which reveals the workings of the universe at the grandest scales  capturing in one beautiful line of algebra everything from why apples fall from trees to the beginning of time and space.      must have been an exciting year to be a physicist. Two new ideas were turning the subject on its head. One was Einstein's theory of relativity  the other was arguably even more revolutionary  quantum mechanics  a mind meltingly strange yet stunningly successful new way of understanding the microworld  the world of atoms and particles. Over the last century  these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe. It's thanks to relativity and quantum mechanics that we've learned what the universe is made from  how it began and how it continues to evolve. A hundred years on  we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics  but what's at stake now is rather different. The next few years may tell us whether we'll be able to continue to increase our understanding of nature  or whether maybe for the first time in the history of science  we could be facing questions that we cannot answer  not because we don't have the brains or technology  but because the laws of physics themselves forbid it. This is the essential problem  the universe is far  far too interesting. Relativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest that the universe should be a boring place. It should be dark  lethal and lifeless. But when we look around us  we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff  full of stars  planets  trees  squirrels. The question is  ultimately  why does all this interesting stuff exist  Why is there something rather than nothing  This contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics  and in the next few years  we may find out whether we'll ever be able to solve it. At the heart of this problem are two numbers  two extremely dangerous numbers. These are properties of the universe that we can measure  and they're extremely dangerous because if they were different  even by a tiny bit  then the universe as we know it would not exist. The first of these numbers is associated with the discovery that was made a few kilometers from this hall  at CERN  home of this machine  the largest scientific device ever built by the human race  the Large Hadron Collider. The LHC whizzes subatomic particles around a    kilometer ring  getting them closer and closer to the speed of light before smashing them into each other inside gigantic particle detectors. On July          physicists at CERN announced to the world that they'd spotted a new fundamental particle being created at the violent collisions at the LHC  the Higgs boson. Now  if you followed the news at the time  you'll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed  and you'd be forgiven for thinking we get that way every time we discover a new particle. Well  that is kind of true  but the Higgs boson is particularly special. We all got so excited because finding the Higgs proves the existence of a cosmic energy field. Now  you may have trouble imagining an energy field  but we've all experienced one. If you've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap  then you've felt the effect of a field. And the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field  except it has a constant value everywhere. It's all around us right now. We can't see it or touch it  but if it wasn't there  we would not exist. The Higgs field gives mass to the fundamental particles that we're made from. If it wasn't there  those particles would have no mass  and no atoms could form and there would be no us. But there is something deeply mysterious about the Higgs field. Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings  a bit like a light switch. It should either be off  so that it has a zero value everywhere in space  or it should be on so it has an absolutely enormous value. In both of these scenarios  atoms could not exist  and therefore all the other interesting stuff that we see around us in the universe would not exist. In reality  the Higgs field is just slightly on  not zero but        trillion times weaker than its fully on value  a bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position. And this value is crucial. If it were a tiny bit different  then there would be no physical structure in the universe. So this is the first of our dangerous numbers  the strength of the Higgs field. Theorists have spent decades trying to understand why it has this very peculiarly fine tuned number  and they've come up with a number of possible explanations. They have sexy sounding names like  supersymmetry  or  large extra dimensions.  I'm not going to go into the details of these ideas now  but the key point is this  if any of them explained this weirdly fine tuned value of the Higgs field  then we should see new particles being created at the LHC along with the Higgs boson. So far  though  we've not seen any sign of them. But there's actually an even worse example of this kind of fine tuning of a dangerous number  and this time it comes from the other end of the scale  from studying the universe at vast distances. One of the most important consequences of Einstein's general theory of relativity was the discovery that the universe began as a rapid expansion of space and time   .  billion years ago  the Big Bang. Now  according to early versions of the Big Bang theory  the universe has been expanding ever since with gravity gradually putting the brakes on that expansion. But in       astronomers made the stunning discovery that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up. The universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster driven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy. Now  whenever you hear the word  dark  in physics  you should get very suspicious because it probably means we don't know what we're talking about. We don't know what dark energy is  but the best idea is that it's the energy of empty space itself  the energy of the vacuum. Now  if you use good old quantum mechanics to work out how strong dark energy should be  you get an absolutely astonishing result. You find that dark energy should be    to the power of     times stronger than the value we observe from astronomy. That's one with     zeroes after it. This is a number so mind bogglingly huge that it's impossible to get your head around. We often use the word  astronomical  when we're talking about big numbers. Well  even that one won't do here. This number is bigger than any number in astronomy. It's a thousand trillion trillion trillion times bigger than the number of atoms in the entire universe. So that's a pretty bad prediction. In fact  it's been called the worst prediction in physics  and this is more than just a theoretical curiosity. If dark energy were anywhere near this strong  then the universe would have been torn apart  stars and galaxies could not form  and we would not be here. So this is the second of those dangerous numbers  the strength of dark energy  and explaining it requires an even more fantastic level of fine tuning than we saw for the Higgs field. But unlike the Higgs field  this number has no known explanation. The hope was that a complete combination of Einstein's general theory of relativity  which is the theory of the universe at grand scales  with quantum mechanics  the theory of the universe at small scales  might provide a solution. Einstein himself spent most of his later years on a futile search for a unified theory of physics  and physicists have kept at it ever since. One of the most promising candidates for a unified theory is string theory  and the essential idea is  if you could zoom in on the fundamental particles that make up our world  you'd see actually that they're not particles at all  but tiny vibrating strings of energy  with each frequency of vibration corresponding to a different particle  a bit like musical notes on a guitar string. So it's a rather elegant  almost poetic way of looking at the world  but it has one catastrophic problem. It turns out that string theory isn't one theory at all  but a whole collection of theories. It's been estimated  in fact  that there are    to the     different versions of string theory. Each one would describe a different universe with different laws of physics. Now  critics say this makes string theory unscientific. You can't disprove the theory. But others actually turned this on its head and said  well  maybe this apparent failure is string theory's greatest triumph. What if all of these    to the     different possible universes actually exist out there somewhere in some grand multiverse  Suddenly we can understand the weirdly fine tuned values of these two dangerous numbers. In most of the multiverse  dark energy is so strong that the universe gets torn apart  or the Higgs field is so weak that no atoms can form. We live in one of the places in the multiverse where the two numbers are just right. We live in a Goldilocks universe. Now  this idea is extremely controversial  and it's easy to see why. If we follow this line of thinking  then we will never be able to answer the question   Why is there something rather than nothing   In most of the multiverse  there is nothing  and we live in one of the few places where the laws of physics allow there to be something. Even worse  we can't test the idea of the multiverse. We can't access these other universes  so there's no way of knowing whether they're there or not. So we're in an extremely frustrating position. That doesn't mean the multiverse doesn't exist. There are other planets  other stars  other galaxies  so why not other universes  The problem is  it's unlikely we'll ever know for sure. Now  the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while  but in the last few years  we've started to get the first solid hints that this line of reasoning may get born out. Despite high hopes for the first run of the LHC  what we were looking for there    we were looking for new theories of physics  supersymmetry or large extra dimensions that could explain this weirdly fine tuned value of the Higgs field. But despite high hopes  the LHC revealed a barren subatomic wilderness populated only by a lonely Higgs boson. My experiment published paper after paper where we glumly had to conclude that we saw no signs of new physics. The stakes now could not be higher. This summer  the LHC began its second phase of operation with an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run. What particle physicists are all desperately hoping for are signs of new particles  micro black holes  or maybe something totally unexpected emerging from the violent collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. If so  then we can continue this long journey that began     years ago with Albert Einstein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature. But if  in two or three years' time  when the LHC switches off again for a second long shutdown  we've found nothing but the Higgs boson  then we may be entering a new era in physics  an era where there are weird features of the universe that we cannot explain  an era where we have hints that we live in a multiverse that lies frustratingly forever beyond our reach  an era where we will never be able to answer the question   Why is there something rather than nothing   Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Harry  even if you just said the science may not have some answers  I would like to ask you a couple of questions  and the first is  building something like the LHC is a generational project. I just mentioned  introducing you  that we live in a short term world. How do you think so long term  projecting yourself out a generation when building something like this  Harry Cliff  I was very lucky that I joined the experiment I work on at the LHC in       just as we were switching on  and there are people in my research group who have been working on it for three decades  their entire careers on one machine. So I think the first conversations about the LHC were in       and you start planning the machine without the technology that you know you're going to need to be able to build it. So the computing power did not exist in the early '  s when design work began in earnest. One of the big detectors which record these collisions  they didn't think there was technology that could withstand the radiation that would be created in the LHC  so there was basically a lump of lead in the middle of this object with some detectors around the outside  but subsequently we have developed technology. So you have to rely on people's ingenuity  that they will solve the problems  but it may be a decade or more down the line. BG  China just announced two or three weeks ago that they intend to build a supercollider twice the size of the LHC. I was wondering how you and your colleagues welcome the news. HC  Size isn't everything  Bruno. BG  I'm sure. I'm sure. It sounds funny for a particle physicist to say that. But I mean  seriously  it's great news. So building a machine like the LHC requires countries from all over the world to pool their resources. No one nation can afford to build a machine this large  apart from maybe China  because they can mobilize huge amounts of resources  manpower and money to build machines like this. So it's only a good thing. What they're really planning to do is to build a machine that will study the Higgs boson in detail and could give us some clues as to whether these new ideas  like supersymmetry  are really out there  so it's great news for physics  I think. BG  Harry  thank you. HC  Thank you very much. Roy Price is a man that most of you have probably never heard about  even though he may have been responsible for    somewhat mediocre  minutes of your life on April         . He may have also been responsible for    very entertaining minutes  but not very many of you. And all of that goes back to a decision that Roy had to make about three years ago. So you see  Roy Price is a senior executive with Amazon Studios. That's the TV production company of Amazon. He's    years old  slim  spiky hair  describes himself on Twitter as  movies  TV  technology  tacos.  And Roy Price has a very responsible job  because it's his responsibility to pick the shows  the original content that Amazon is going to make. And of course that's a highly competitive space. I mean  there are so many TV shows already out there  that Roy can't just choose any show. He has to find shows that are really  really great. So in other words  he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here. So this curve here is the rating distribution of about       TV shows on the website IMDB  and the rating goes from one to     and the height here shows you how many shows get that rating. So if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher  that's a winner. Then you have a top two percent show. That's shows like  Breaking Bad    Game of Thrones    The Wire   so all of these shows that are addictive  whereafter you've watched a season  your brain is basically like   Where can I get more of these episodes   That kind of show. On the left side  just for clarity  here on that end  you have a show called  Toddlers and Tiaras        which should tell you enough about what's going on on that end of the curve. Now  Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve  because I think you would have to have some serious brainpower to undercut  Toddlers and Tiaras.  So what he's worried about is this middle bulge here  the bulge of average TV  you know  those shows that aren't really good or really bad  they don't really get you excited. So he needs to make sure that he's really on the right end of this. So the pressure is on  and of course it's also the first time that Amazon is even doing something like this  so Roy Price does not want to take any chances. He wants to engineer success. He needs a guaranteed success  and so what he does is  he holds a competition. So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows  and from those ideas  through an evaluation  they select eight candidates for TV shows  and then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows and puts them online for free for everyone to watch. And so when Amazon is giving out free stuff  you're going to take it  right  So millions of viewers are watching those episodes. What they don't realize is that  while they're watching their shows  actually  they are being watched. They are being watched by Roy Price and his team  who record everything. They record when somebody presses play  when somebody presses pause  what parts they skip  what parts they watch again. So they collect millions of data points  because they want to have those data points to then decide which show they should make. And sure enough  so they collect all the data  they do all the data crunching  and an answer emerges  and the answer is   Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican US Senators.  They did that show. So does anyone know the name of the show  Yes   Alpha House   but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show  actually  because it didn't turn out that great. It's actually just an average show  actually    literally  in fact  because the average of this curve here is at  .   and  Alpha House  lands at  .   so a slightly above average show  but certainly not what Roy Price and his team were aiming for. Meanwhile  however  at about the same time  at another company  another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis  and his name is Ted  Ted Sarandos  who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix  and just like Roy  he's on a constant mission to find that great TV show  and he uses data as well to do that  except he does it a little bit differently. So instead of holding a competition  what he did    and his team of course    was they looked at all the data they already had about Netflix viewers  you know  the ratings they give their shows  the viewing histories  what shows people like  and so on. And then they use that data to discover all of these little bits and pieces about the audience  what kinds of shows they like  what kind of producers  what kind of actors. And once they had all of these pieces together  they took a leap of faith  and they decided to license not a sitcom about four Senators but a drama series about a single Senator. You guys know the show  Yes   House of Cards   and Netflix of course  nailed it with that show  at least for the first two seasons.  House of Cards  gets a  .  rating on this curve  so it's exactly where they wanted it to be. Now  the question of course is  what happened here  So you have two very competitive  data savvy companies. They connect all of these millions of data points  and then it works beautifully for one of them  and it doesn't work for the other one. So why  Because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time. I mean  if you're collecting millions of data points on a decision you're going to make  then you should be able to make a pretty good decision. You have     years of statistics to rely on. You're amplifying it with very powerful computers. The least you could expect is good TV  right  And if data analysis does not work that way  then it actually gets a little scary  because we live in a time where we're turning to data more and more to make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV. Does anyone here know the company Multi Health Systems  No one. OK  that's good actually. OK  so Multi Health Systems is a software company  and I hope that nobody here in this room ever comes into contact with that software  because if you do  it means you're in prison. If someone here in the US is in prison  and they apply for parole  then it's very likely that data analysis software from that company will be used in determining whether to grant that parole. So it's the same principle as Amazon and Netflix  but now instead of deciding whether a TV show is going to be good or bad  you're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad. And mediocre TV     minutes  that can be pretty bad  but more years in prison  I guess  even worse. And unfortunately  there is actually some evidence that this data analysis  despite having lots of data  does not always produce optimum results. And that's not because a company like Multi Health Systems doesn't know what to do with data. Even the most data savvy companies get it wrong. Yes  even Google gets it wrong sometimes. In       Google announced that they were able  with data analysis  to predict outbreaks of influenza  the nasty kind of flu  by doing data analysis on their Google searches. And it worked beautifully  and it made a big splash in the news  including the pinnacle of scientific success  a publication in the journal  Nature.  It worked beautifully for year after year after year  until one year it failed. And nobody could even tell exactly why. It just didn't work that year  and of course that again made big news  including now a retraction of a publication from the journal  Nature.  So even the most data savvy companies  Amazon and Google  they sometimes get it wrong. And despite all those failures  data is moving rapidly into real life decision making    into the workplace  law enforcement  medicine. So we should better make sure that data is helping. Now  personally I've seen a lot of this struggle with data myself  because I work in computational genetics  which is also a field where lots of very smart people are using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions like deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug. And over the years  I've noticed a sort of pattern or kind of rule  if you will  about the difference between successful decision making with data and unsuccessful decision making  and I find this a pattern worth sharing  and it goes something like this. So whenever you're solving a complex problem  you're doing essentially two things. The first one is  you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces  and then of course you do the second part. You put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion. And sometimes you have to do it over again  but it's always those two things  taking apart and putting back together again. And now the crucial thing is that data and data analysis is only good for the first part. Data and data analysis  no matter how powerful  can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces. It's not suited to put those pieces back together again and then to come to a conclusion. There's another tool that can do that  and we all have it  and that tool is the brain. If there's one thing a brain is good at  it's taking bits and pieces back together again  even when you have incomplete information  and coming to a good conclusion  especially if it's the brain of an expert. And that's why I believe that Netflix was so successful  because they used data and brains where they belong in the process. They use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to understand at that depth  but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces and put them back together again and make a show like  House of Cards   that was nowhere in the data. Ted Sarandos and his team made that decision to license that show  which also meant  by the way  that they were taking a pretty big personal risk with that decision. And Amazon  on the other hand  they did it the wrong way around. They used data all the way to drive their decision making  first when they held their competition of TV ideas  then when they selected  Alpha House  to make as a show. Which of course was a very safe decision for them  because they could always point at the data  saying   This is what the data tells us.  But it didn't lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for. So data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions  but I believe that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions. No matter how powerful  data is just a tool  and to keep that in mind  I find this device here quite useful. Many of you will ... Before there was data  this was the decision making device to use. Many of you will know this. This toy here is called the Magic   Ball  and it's really amazing  because if you have a decision to make  a yes or no question  all you have to do is you shake the ball  and then you get an answer     Most Likely     right here in this window in real time. I'll have it out later for tech demos. Now  the thing is  of course    so I've made some decisions in my life where  in hindsight  I should have just listened to the ball. But  you know  of course  if you have the data available  you want to replace this with something much more sophisticated  like data analysis to come to a better decision. But that does not change the basic setup. So the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter  but I believe it's still on us to make the decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary  on the right end of the curve. And I find that a very encouraging message  in fact  that even in the face of huge amounts of data  it still pays off to make decisions  to be an expert in what you're doing and take risks. Because in the end  it's not data  it's risks that will land you on the right end of the curve. Thank you. I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists. I can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess. But I know that it's there. And understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it. On our planet  where there's water  there's life. So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars. At this distance  shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures  planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside. Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars. What I do picks up where their job ends. I model the possible climates of exoplanets. And here's why that's important  there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life. Take the planet Venus. It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty  because of its benign  ethereal appearance in the sky. But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story. The surface temperature is close to     degrees Fahrenheit      Celsius. That's hot enough to melt lead. Its thick atmosphere  not its distance from the sun  is the reason. It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids  trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface. The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet. From these lessons from our own solar system  we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life. We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us. For example  one of the closest planets that could support surface water    it's called Gliese     Cc    such a glamorous name  right  nice phone number for a name    it's    light years away. So that's more than     trillion miles. Trying to measure the atmospheric composition of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard. It's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car's headlight. OK  now imagine that car is     trillion miles away  and you want to know the precise color of that fly. So I use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life. Here's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler   f  with the Earth for reference. It's       light years away  and just    percent larger than Earth. Our NSF funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit. So I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life. Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate. Ice absorbs longer  redder wavelengths of light  and reflects shorter  bluer light. That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue. The redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice. Only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom. Then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes and we see blue ice. My models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars. There's another contradiction    that ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars  and that light  that energy  heats the ice. Using climate models to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere. And it's no surprise that this is my specialty. I'm an African American female astronomer and a classically trained actor who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines  so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature    ... and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists. My organization  Rising Stargirls  teaches astronomy to middle school girls of color  using theater  writing and visual art. That's another contradiction    science and art don't often go together  but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn  and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions  and use their backgrounds to discover  once and for all  that we are truly not alone in the universe. Thank you. Our grandparents' generation created an amazing system of canals and reservoirs that made it possible for people to live in places where there wasn't a lot of water. For example  during the Great Depression  they created the Hoover Dam  which in turn  created Lake Mead and made it possible for the cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix and Los Angeles to provide water for people who lived in a really dry place. In the   th century  we literally spent trillions of dollars building infrastructure to get water to our cities. In terms of economic development  it was a great investment. But in the last decade  we've seen the combined effects of climate change  population growth and competition for water resources threaten these vital lifelines and water resources. This figure shows you the change in the lake level of Lake Mead that happened in the last    years. You can see starting around the year       the lake level started to drop. And it was dropping at such a rate that it would have left the drinking water intakes for Las Vegas high and dry. The city became so concerned about this that they recently constructed a new drinking water intake structure that they referred to as the  Third Straw  to pull water out of the greater depths of the lake. The challenges associated with providing water to a modern city are not restricted to the American Southwest. In the year       the third largest city in Australia  Brisbane  came within   months of running out of water. A similar drama is playing out today in S o Paulo  Brazil  where the main reservoir for the city has gone from being completely full in       to being nearly empty today as the city approaches the      Summer Olympics. For those of us who are fortunate enough to live in one of the world's great cities  we've never truly experienced the effects of a catastrophic drought. We like to complain about the navy showers we have to take. We like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns. But we've never really faced the prospect of turning on the tap and having nothing come out. And that's because when things have gotten bad in the past  it's always been possible to expand a reservoir or dig a few more groundwater wells. Well  in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for  it's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way of providing ourselves with water. Some people think that we're going to solve the urban water problem by taking water from our rural neighbors. But that's an approach that's fraught with political  legal and social dangers. And even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors  we're just transferring the problem to someone else and there's a good chance it will come back and bite us in the form of higher food prices and damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water. I think that there's a better way to solve our urban water crisis and I think that's to open up four new local sources of water that I liken to faucets. If we can make smart investments in these new sources of water in the coming years  we can solve our urban water problem and decrease the likelihood that we'll ever run across the effects of a catastrophic drought. Now  if you told me    years ago that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water  I probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer. But my own experiences working with some of the world's most water starved cities in the last decades have shown me that we have the technologies and the management skills to actually transition away from imported water  and that's what I want to tell you about tonight. The first source of local water supply that we need to develop to solve our urban water problem will flow with the rainwater that falls in our cities. One of the great tragedies of urban development is that as our cities grew  we started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asphalt. And when we did that  we had to build storm sewers to get the water that fell on the cities out before it could cause flooding  and that's a waste of a vital water resource. Let me give you an example. This figure here shows you the volume of water that could be collected in the city of San Jose if they could harvest the stormwater that fell within the city limits. You can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line that if San Jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city  they'd have enough water to get them through an entire year. Now  I know what some of you are probably thinking.  The answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks and attaching them to the downspouts of our roof gutters  rainwater harvesting.  Now  that's an idea that might work in some places. But if you live in a place where it mainly rains in the winter time and most of the water demand is in the summertime  it's not a very cost effective way to solve a water problem. And if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought  like California's currently experiencing  you just can't build a rainwater tank that's big enough to solve your problem. I think there's a lot more practical way to harvest the stormwater and the rainwater that falls in our cities  and that's to capture it and let it percolate into the ground. After all  many of our cities are sitting on top of a natural water storage system that can accommodate huge volumes of water. For example  historically  Los Angeles has obtained about a third of its water supply from a massive aquifer that underlies the San Fernando Valley. Now  when you look at the water that comes off of your roof and runs off of your lawn and flows down the gutter  you might say to yourself   Do I really want to drink that stuff   Well  the answer is you don't want to drink it until it's been treated a little bit. And so the challenge that we face in urban water harvesting is to capture the water  clean the water and get it underground. And that's exactly what the city of Los Angeles is doing with a new project that they're building in Burbank  California. This figure here shows the stormwater park that they're building by hooking a series of stormwater collection systems  or storm sewers  and routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry. The water that's captured in the quarry is slowly passed through a man made wetland  and then it goes into that ball field there and percolates into the ground  recharging the drinking water aquifer of the city. And in the process of passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground  the water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil  and that purifies the water. And if the water's still not clean enough to drink after it's been through this natural treatment process  the city can treat it again when they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers before they deliver it to people to drink. The second tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with the wastewater that comes out of our sewage treatment plants. Now  many of you are probably familiar with the concept of recycled water. You've probably seen signs like this that tell you that the shrubbery and the highway median and the local golf course is being watered with water that used to be in a sewage treatment plant. We've been doing this for a couple of decades now. But what we're learning from our experience is that this approach is much more expensive that we expected it to be. Because once we build the first few water recycling systems close to the sewage treatment plant  we have to build longer and longer pipe networks to get that water to where it needs to go. And that becomes prohibitive in terms of cost. What we're finding is that a much more cost effective and practical way of recycling wastewater is to turn treated wastewater into drinking water through a two step process. In the first step in this process we pressurize the water and pass it through a reverse osmosis membrane  a thin  permeable plastic membrane that allows water molecules to pass through but traps and retains the salts  the viruses and the organic chemicals that might be present in the wastewater. In the second step in the process  we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and shine ultraviolet light on the water. The ultraviolet light cleaves the hydrogen peroxide into two parts that are called hydroxyl radicals  and these hydroxyl radicals are very potent forms of oxygen that break down most organic chemicals. After the water's been through this two stage process  it's safe to drink. I know  I've been studying recycled water using every measurement technique known to modern science for the past    years. We've detected some chemicals that can make it through the first step in the process  but by the time we get to the second step  the advanced oxidation process  we rarely see any chemicals present. And that's in stark contrast to the taken for granted water supplies that we regularly drink all the time. There's another way we can recycle water. This is an engineered treatment wetland that we recently built on the Santa Ana River in Southern California. The treatment wetland receives water from a part of the Santa Ana River that in the summertime consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent from cities like Riverside and San Bernardino. The water comes into our treatment wetland  it's exposed to sunlight and algae and those break down the organic chemicals  remove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens. The water gets put back in the Santa Ana River  it flows down to Anaheim  gets taken out at Anaheim and percolated into the ground  and becomes the drinking water of the city of Anaheim  completing the trip from the sewers of Riverside County to the drinking water supply of Orange County. Now  you might think that this idea of drinking wastewater is some sort of futuristic fantasy or not commonly done. Well  in California  we already recycle about    billion gallons a year of wastewater through the two stage advanced treatment process I was telling you about. That's enough water to be the supply of about a million people if it were their sole water supply. The third tap that we need to open up will not be a tap at all  it will be a kind of virtual tap  it will be the water conservation that we manage to do. And the place where we need to think about water conservation is outdoors because in California and other modern American cities  about half of our water use happens outdoors. In the current drought  we've seen that it's possible to have our lawns survive and our plants survive with about half as much water. So there's no need to start painting concrete green and putting in Astroturf and buying cactuses. We can have California friendly landscaping with soil moisture detectors and smart irrigation controllers and have beautiful green landscapes in our cities. The fourth and final water tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with desalinated seawater. Now  I know what you probably heard people say about seawater desalination.  It's a great thing to do if you have lots of oil  not a lot of water and you don't care about climate change.  Seawater desalination is energy intensive no matter how you slice it. But that characterization of seawater desalination as being a nonstarter is hopelessly out of date. We've made tremendous progress in seawater desalination in the past two decades. This picture shows you the largest seawater desalination plant in the Western hemisphere that's currently being built north of San Diego. Compared to the seawater desalination plant that was built in Santa Barbara    years ago  this treatment plant will use about half the energy to produce a gallon of water. But just because seawater desalination has become less energy intensive  doesn't mean we should start building desalination plants everywhere. Among the different choices we have  it's probably the most energy intensive and potentially environmentally damaging of the options to create a local water supply. So there it is. With these four sources of water  we can move away from our reliance on imported water. Through reform in the way we landscape our surfaces and our properties  we can reduce outdoor water use by about    percent  thereby increasing  the water supply by    percent. We can recycle the water that makes it into the sewer  thereby increasing our water supply by    percent. And we can make up the difference through a combination of stormwater harvesting and seawater desalination. So  let's create a water supply that will be able to withstand any of the challenges that climate change throws at us in the coming years. Let's create a water supply that uses local sources and leaves more water in the environment for fish and for food. Let's create a water system that's consistent with out environmental values. And let's do it for our children and our grandchildren and let's tell them this is the system that they have to take care of in the future because it's our last chance to create a new kind of water system. Thank you very much for your attention. A few years ago  I got one of those spam emails. And it managed to get through my spam filter. I'm not quite sure how  but it turned up in my inbox  and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh. I know. It went like this  it said   Hello James Veitch  I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you  Solomon.  Now  my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button  right  I was looking at my phone. I thought  I could just delete this. Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do. And I said   Solomon  Your email intrigues me.  And the game was afoot. He said   Dear James Veitch  We shall be shipping Gold to you.   You will earn     of any gold you distributes.  So I knew I was dealing with a professional. I said   How much is it worth   He said   We will start with smaller quantity      I was like  aww    and then he said   of    kgs. The worth should be about   .  million.  I said   Solomon  if we're going to do it  let's go big. I can handle it. How much gold do you have   He said   It is not a matter of how much gold I have  what matters is your capability of handling. We can start with    kgs as trial shipment.  I said      kgs  There's no point doing this at all unless you're shipping at least a metric ton.  He said   What do you do for a living   I said   I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager.  This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion  my friend  no no no. Then I started to panic. I was like   Where are you based   I don't know about you  but I think if we're going via the postal service  it ought to be signed for. That's a lot of gold.  He said   It will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment.  I said   Solomon  I'm completely with you on this one. I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting. Hold tight.  This is what I sent Solomon. I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house  but there's definitely something going on. I said   Solomon  attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart. I've had one of my assistants run the numbers. We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible.  There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings  and this was it for Solomon. He said   I will be so much happy if the deal goes well  because I'm going to get a very good commission as well.  And I said   That's amazing  What are you going to spend your cut on   And he said   On RealEstate  what about you   I thought about it for a long time. And I said   One word  Hummus.   It's going places. I was in Sainsbury's the other day and there were like    different varieties. Also you can cut up carrots  and you can dip them. Have you ever done that  Solomon   He said   I have to go bed now.   Till morrow. Have sweet dream.  I didn't know what to say  I said   Bonsoir my golden nugget  bonsoir.  Guys  you have to understand  this had been going for  like  weeks  albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life  but I had to knock it on the head. It was getting a bit out of hand. Friends were saying   James  do you want to come for a drink   I was like   I can't  I'm expecting an email about some gold.  So I figured I had to knock it on the head. I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion. So I concocted a plan. I said   Solomon  I'm concerned about security. When we email each other  we need to use a code.  And he agreed. I said   Solomon  I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence  Lawyer  Gummy Bear. Bank  Cream Egg. Legal  Fizzy Cola Bottle. Claim  Peanut M Ms. Documents  Jelly Beans. Western Union  A Giant Gummy Lizard.  I knew these were all words they use  right  I said   Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence.  I didn't hear back. I thought  I've gone too far. I've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little. I said   Solomon  Is the deal still on  KitKat.  Because you have to be consistent. Then I did get an email back from him. He said   The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ...  I said   Dude  you have to use the code   What followed is the greatest email I've ever received. I'm not joking  this is what turned up in my inbox. This was a good day.  The business is on. I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear    so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg  for the Peanut M Ms process to start. Send       pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard.  And that was so much fun  right  that it got me thinking  like  what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could  And that's what I've been doing for three years on your behalf. Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails. It's really difficult  and I highly recommend we do it. I don't think what I'm doing is mean. There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers. All I'm doing is wasting their time. And I think any time they're spending with me is time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings  right  And if you're going to do this    and I highly recommend you do    get yourself a pseudonymous email address. Don't use your own email address. That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare. I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements  only one of which was a legitimate response    to a medical question I had. But I'll tell you what  though  guys  I'll tell you what  any day is a good day  any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this   I AM WINNIE MANDELA  THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT.  I was like  oh     that Winnie Mandela. I know so many.  I NEED TO TRANSFER    MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION.  Let that sink in. She sent me this  which is hysterical. And this. And this looks fairly legitimate  this is a letter of authorization. But to be honest  if there's nothing written on it  it's just a shape  I said   Winnie  I'm really sorry to hear of this. Given that Nelson died three months ago  I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious.  That's the worst health condition you can have  not being alive. She said   KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS. ONE LOVE.  I said   Of course. NO WOMAN  NO CRY.  She said   MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF      DOLLARS. ONE LOVE.  I said   no problemo. I SHOT THE SHERIFF.     BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY    Thank you. Late in January       a    year old German girl called Vera Brandes walked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House. The auditorium was empty. It was lit only by the dim  green glow of the emergency exit sign. This was the most exciting day of Vera's life. She was the youngest concert promoter in Germany  and she had persuaded the Cologne Opera House to host a late night concert of jazz from the American musician  Keith Jarrett.       people were coming. And in just a few hours  Jarrett would walk out on the same stage  he'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal or sheet music  he would begin to play. But right now  Vera was introducing Keith to the piano in question  and it wasn't going well. Jarrett looked to the instrument a little warily  played a few notes  walked around it  played a few more notes  muttered something to his producer. Then the producer came over to Vera and said ...  If you don't get a new piano  Keith can't play.  There'd been a mistake. The opera house had provided the wrong instrument. This one had this harsh  tinny upper register  because all the felt had worn away. The black notes were sticking  the white notes were out of tune  the pedals didn't work and the piano itself was just too small. It wouldn't create the volume that would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House. So Keith Jarrett left. He went and sat outside in his car  leaving Vera Brandes to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano. Now she got a piano tuner  but she couldn't get a new piano. And so she went outside and she stood there in the rain  talking to Keith Jarrett  begging him not to cancel the concert. And he looked out of his car at this bedraggled  rain drenched German teenager  took pity on her  and said   Never forget ... only for you.  And so a few hours later  Jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house  he sat down at the unplayable piano and began. Within moments it became clear that something magical was happening. Jarrett was avoiding those upper registers  he was sticking to the middle tones of the keyboard  which gave the piece a soothing  ambient quality. But also  because the piano was so quiet  he had to set up these rumbling  repetitive riffs in the bass. And he stood up twisting  pounding down on the keys  desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row. It's an electrifying performance. It somehow has this peaceful quality  and at the same time it's full of energy  it's dynamic. And the audience loved it. Audiences continue to love it because the recording of the K ln Concert is the best selling piano album in history and the best selling solo jazz album in history. Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess. He had embraced that mess  and it soared. But let's think for a moment about Jarrett's initial instinct. He didn't want to play. Of course  I think any of us  in any remotely similar situation  would feel the same way  we'd have the same instinct. We don't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools. We don't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles. But Jarrett's instinct was wrong  and thank goodness he changed his mind. And I think our instinct is also wrong. I think we need to gain a bit more appreciation for the unexpected advantages of having to cope with a little mess. So let me give you some examples from cognitive psychology  from complexity science  from social psychology  and of course  rock 'n' roll. So cognitive psychology first. We've actually known for a while that certain kinds of difficulty  certain kinds of obstacle  can actually improve our performance. For example  the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer  a few years ago  teamed up with high school teachers. And he asked them to reformat the handouts that they were giving to some of their classes. So the regular handout would be formatted in something straightforward  such as Helvetica or Times New Roman. But half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted in something sort of intense  like Haettenschweiler  or something with a zesty bounce  like Comic Sans italicized. Now  these are really ugly fonts  and they're difficult fonts to read. But at the end of the semester  students were given exams  and the students who'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts  had actually done better on their exams  in a variety of subjects. And the reason is  the difficult font had slowed them down  forced them to work a bit harder  to think a bit more about what they were reading  to interpret it ... and so they learned more. Another example. The psychologist Shelley Carson has been testing Harvard undergraduates for the quality of their attentional filters. What do I mean by that  What I mean is  imagine you're in a restaurant  you're having a conversation  there are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant  you want to filter them out  you want to focus on what's important to you. Can you do that  If you can  you have good  strong attentional filters. But some people really struggle with that. Some of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that. They had weak filters  they had porous filters    let a lot of external information in. And so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted by the sights and the sounds of the world around them. If there was a television on while they were doing their essays  they couldn't screen it out. Now  you would think that that was a disadvantage ... but no. When Carson looked at what these students had achieved  the ones with the weak filters were vastly more likely to have some real creative milestone in their lives  to have published their first novel  to have released their first album. These distractions were actually grists to their creative mill. They were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes. Let's talk about complexity science. So how do you solve a really complex    the world's full of complicated problems    how do you solve a really complicated problem  For example  you try to make a jet engine. There are lots and lots of different variables  the operating temperature  the materials  all the different dimensions  the shape. You can't solve that kind of problem all in one go  it's too hard. So what do you do  Well  one thing you can do is try to solve it step by step. So you have some kind of prototype and you tweak it  you test it  you improve it. You tweak it  you test it  you improve it. Now  this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine. And it's been quite widely implemented in the world. So you'll hear about it  for example  in high performance cycling  web designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages  they're looking for these step by step gains. That's a good way to solve a complicated problem. But you know what would make it a better way  A dash of mess. You add randomness  early on in the process  you make crazy moves  you try stupid things that shouldn't work  and that will tend to make the problem solving work better. And the reason for that is the trouble with the step by step process  the marginal gains  is they can walk you gradually down a dead end. And if you start with the randomness  that becomes less likely  and your problem solving becomes more robust. Let's talk about social psychology. So the psychologist Katherine Phillips  with some colleagues  recently gave murder mystery problems to some students  and these students were collected in groups of four and they were given dossiers with information about a crime    alibis and evidence  witness statements and three suspects. And the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it  who committed the crime. And there were two treatments in this experiment. In some cases these were four friends  they all knew each other well. In other cases  three friends and a stranger. And you can see where I'm going with this. Obviously I'm going to say that the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively  which is true  they did. Actually  they solved the problem quite a lot more effectively. So the groups of four friends  they only had a       chance of getting the answer right. Which is actually not that great    in multiple choice  for three answers       's not good. The three friends and the stranger  even though the stranger didn't have any extra information  even though it was just a case of how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness  the three friends and the stranger  they had a    percent chance of finding the right answer. That's quite a big leap in performance. But I think what's really interesting is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job  but how they felt about it. So when Katherine Phillips interviewed the groups of four friends  they had a nice time  they also thought they'd done a good job. They were complacent. When she spoke to the three friends and the stranger  they had not had a nice time    it's actually rather difficult  it's rather awkward ... and they were full of doubt. They didn't think they'd done a good job even though they had. And I think that really exemplifies the challenge that we're dealing with here. Because  yeah    the ugly font  the awkward stranger  the random move ... these disruptions help us solve problems  they help us become more creative. But we don't feel that they're helping us. We feel that they're getting in the way ... and so we resist. And that's why the last example is really important. So I want to talk about somebody from the background of the world of rock 'n' roll. And you may know him  he's actually a TED ster. His name is Brian Eno. He is an ambient composer    rather brilliant. He's also a kind of catalyst behind some of the great rock 'n' roll albums of the last    years. He's worked with David Bowie on  Heroes   he worked with U  on  Achtung Baby  and  The Joshua Tree   he's worked with DEVO  he's worked with Coldplay  he's worked with everybody. And what does he do to make these great rock bands better  Well  he makes a mess. He disrupts their creative processes. It's his role to be the awkward stranger. It's his role to tell them that they have to play the unplayable piano. And one of the ways in which he creates this disruption is through this remarkable deck of cards    I have my signed copy here    thank you  Brian. They're called The Oblique Strategies  he developed them with a friend of his. And when they're stuck in the studio  Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards. He'll draw one at random  and he'll make the band follow the instructions on the card. So this one ...  Change instrument roles.  Yeah  everyone swap instruments    Drummer on the piano    Brilliant  brilliant idea.  Look closely at the most  embarrassing details. Amplify them.   Make a sudden  destructive  unpredictable action. Incorporate.  These cards are disruptive. Now  they've proved their worth in album after album. The musicians hate them. So Phil Collins was playing drums on an early Brian Eno album. He got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio. Carlos Alomar  great rock guitarist  working with Eno on David Bowie's  Lodger  album  and at one point he turns to Brian and says   Brian  this experiment is stupid.  But the thing is it was a pretty good album  but also  Carlos Alomar     years later  now uses The Oblique Strategies. And he tells his students to use The Oblique Strategies because he's realized something. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't helping you. The strategies actually weren't a deck of cards originally  they were just a list    list on the recording studio wall. A checklist of things you might try if you got stuck. The list didn't work. Know why  Not messy enough. Your eye would go down the list and it would settle on whatever was the least disruptive  the least troublesome  which of course misses the point entirely. And what Brian Eno came to realize was  yes  we need to run the stupid experiments  we need to deal with the awkward strangers  we need to try to read the ugly fonts. These things help us. They help us solve problems  they help us be more creative. But also ... we really need some persuasion if we're going to accept this. So however we do it ... whether it's sheer willpower  whether it's the flip of a card or whether it's a guilt trip from a German teenager  all of us  from time to time  need to sit down and try and play the unplayable piano. Thank you. I have been a police officer for a very  very long time. And you see these notes in my hand because I'm also a black preacher. And if you know anything about black preachers  we'll close  and then we'll keep going for another    minutes. So I need this to keep pushing this thing forward. I've been a police officer for a very long time  and I mean I predated technology. I'm talking about before pagers. Laugh if you want to  but I'm telling the truth. I predate War on Our Fellow Man    I mean  War on Drugs. I predate all of that. I predate so much and I've been through ebbs and flows and I've been through good and bad times  and still I absolutely love being a police officer. I love being a police officer because it's always been a calling for me and never a job. And even with that  my personal truth is that law enforcement is in a crisis. It's an invisible crisis  and it has been for many  many years. Even though we in law enforcement say   You know what  We can't arrest our way out of this.  We say in law enforcement things like   Yeah  it's illegal to profile.  You know what  In law enforcement  we even agree that we have to adopt this thinking and become more oriented to community policing. And yet all the while  still  we continue in the same vein  the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted. And so that's the reason for me  several years ago. Because I was tired of the racism  I was tired of discrimination  I was tired of the   isms  and the schisms. I was just so tired. I was tired of the vicious cycle  and I was tired of it even in the beloved agency in the department that I still love today. And so my wife and I  we sat down and we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire. We would retire and I would go off into the sunset  maybe do ministry full time  love my wife a long time. Y'all know what I'm talking about. But we decided that I would retire. But then there was a higher power than I. There was a love for the city that I loved  that I grew up in  that I was educated in    a city that pulled my heart back into the system. So we didn't retire. We didn't retire and so what happened was  over the next    I would say     months     months  I had this passion to implement some radical policing. And so now  over the next    months  I shifted  and I transcended from being a drug sergeant    ready to retire as a drug sergeant    and went from level to level to level  until I find myself as a district commander  commander of the worst district in Baltimore city. We call it the Eastern District  the most violent district  the most impoverished district       percent unemployment in that district. National rating at that time  national rating  the AIDS and the tuberculosis  rating   was always on the top    list for zip codes for cities across the nation  or just zip codes across the nation. The top       I didn't say state  I didn't say city    that little neighborhood. And I said  you know what  We gotta do something different. We gotta do something different. We gotta think radical. We gotta think outside the box. And so in order to bring change that I desperately wanted and I desperately felt in my heart  I had to start listening to that inner spirit. I had to start listening to that man on the inside that went against everything that I had been trained to do. But we still did it. We still did it because we listened to that inner spirit  because I realized this  if I was to see real police reform in the communities that I had authority over for public safety  we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'. We had to change it. And so what we did is we started to think holistically and not paramilitarily. So we thought differently. And we started to realize that it could never be and never should have been us versus them. And so I decided to come to that intersection where I could meet all classes  all races  all creeds  all colors  where I would meet the businesses and the faith based  and the eds  the meds  and I would meet all the people that made up the communities that I had authority over. So I met them and I began to listen. See  police have a problem. Off the top  we want to bring things into the community and come up with these extravagant strategies and deployments  but we never talk to the community about them. And we shove them into the community and say   Take that.  But we said we'd get rid of that stinkin' thinkin'  so we talked to our communities. We said   This is your community table. We'll pull up a chair. We want to hear from you. What's going to work in your community   And then some great things started to happen. See  here's the thing  I had to figure out a way to shift     cops that were under my tutelage from being occupiers of communities to being partners. I had to figure out how to do that. Because here's the crazy thing  in law enforcement  we have evolved into something incredible. Listen  we have become great protectors. We know how to protect you. But we have exercised that arm so much  so very much. If I was a natural police department and I represented a police department  you would see this incredible  beautiful     inch arm. It's pretty  ain't it  It's cut up. No fat on it. Mmm it look good. It just look good  That's a great arm    protection  That's who we are  but we've exercised it so much sometimes that it has led to abuse. It's led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us. And we've forgotten the mantra across this nation is to protect and serve. Y'all don't know that  Protect and serve. So you look at the other arm  and then you look at it and ... there it is. You know  it's kinda weak. It looks sickly. It's withering and it's dying because we've invested so much in our protective arm. But we forgot to treat our communities like they're our customers  like they're our sons and daughters  our brothers and sisters  our mothers and fathers. And so somehow  along the way  we've gotten out of balance. And because we are a proud profession  it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes. It's even harder to make a change. And so  as I try to hurry and get through this  I need to say this  it's not just law enforcement  though. Because every one of us makes up a community. Everybody makes up a community. And as communities    can I say this     we have put too much responsibility on law enforcement. Too much. And then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset with law enforcement when we take action. There is no way in the world that we  as a community  should be calling the police for kids playing ball in the street. No way in the world that we should be calling the police because my neighbor's music is up too loud  because his dog came over to my yard and did a number two  there's no way we should be calling the police. But we have surrendered so much of our responsibility. Listen  when I was a little boy coming up in Baltimore    and listen  we played rough in the street    I ain't never see the police come and break us up. You know who came  It was the elders. It was the parental figures in the community. It was those guardians  it was that village mentality. They came and said   Stop that   and  Do this.  and  Stop that.  We had mentors throughout all of the community. So it takes all of us  all of us. And when I say community  I'm talking about everything that makes up a community  even    listen  because I'm a preacher  I'm very hard on the churches  because I believe the churches too often have become MIA  missing in action. I believe they have shifted over the last        years from being community churches  where you walk outside your door  round the corner and you're in church. They shifted from that and became commuter churches. So you now have churches who have become disconnected by default from the very community where they're planted. And they don't take care of that community. I could go on and on  but I really need to wrap this up. Community and policing  we've all lost that precious gift  and I call it relational equity. We've lost it with one another. It's not somebody else's fault    it's all of our fault. We all take responsibility in this. But I say this  it's not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again. It is never too late. It is never too late. You see  after three years of my four and a half year commandship in that district  three years in  after putting pastors in the car with my police because I knew this    it's a little secret    I knew this  it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you're riding around with a clergy. You'd be getting in and out of the car  looking to your right  talking about   Father  forgive me  for I have sinned   all day long    you can't do it  So we came up with some incredible initiatives  engagements for our community and police to build that trust back. We began to deal with our youth and with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence. We knew we had an economic problem  so we began to create jobs. We knew there was sickness in our community and they didn't have access to proper medical care  so we'd partner up. We got to that intersection and partnered up with anybody that wanted to partner with us and talked about what we needed holistically  never thinking about the crime. Because at the end of the day  if we took care of the needs of the people  if we got to the root cause  the crime would take care of itself. It would take care of itself. And so  after three years of a four and a half year stint  we looked back and we looked over and found out that we were at a    year historical low  our crime numbers  our homicides    everything had dropped down  back to the     s. And it might go back further  but the problem is  we only started keeping data since     . Forty year crime low  so much so  I had other commanders call me   Hey Mel  whatcha doin'  man  Whatcha doin'  We gotta get some of that   And so we gave them some of that. And in a short period of time  the city went to a    year crime low. For the first time in    years  we fell  Baltimore city  to under     homicides        to be exact. And we celebrated  because we had learned to become great servers  become great servers first. But I gotta tell you this  these last few years  as much as we had learned to become great proactive police officers and great relational police officers rather than reactive  these last years have disappointed me. They have broken my heart. The uprising still hurts. It still hurts my heart  because truly I believe that it should've never happened. I believe it should've never happened if we were allowed to continue along the vein that we were in  servicing our community  treating them like human beings  treating them with respect  loving on them first. If we continued in that vein  it would've never happened. But somehow  we went back to business as usual. But I'm excited again  I'm excited again  because now we have a police commissioner who not only talks about community policing  but he absolutely understands it  and more importantly  he embraces it. So I'm very excited now. Listen  I'm excited about Baltimore today  because we  as many cities  I believe shall rise from the ashes. I believe    I truly believe    that we will be great again. I believe  as we continue to wrap arms and continue to say   We're in this together   because it's not just an intersection  once we meet  we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals  and this city will become great again. This nation will become great again. Because we have the same goal  we all want peace. We all want respect for one another. We all want love. And I believe we are back on that road  and I'm so excited about it. So listen  I thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time. God bless you all. God bless you. I once said   If you want to liberate a society  all you need is the Internet.  I was wrong. I said those words back in       when a Facebook page I anonymously created helped spark the Egyptian revolution. The Arab Spring revealed social media's greatest potential  but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings. The same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart. I would like to share my own experience in using social media for activism  and talk about some of the challenges I have personally faced and what we could do about them. In the early     s  Arabs were flooding the web. Thirsty for knowledge  for opportunities  for connecting with the rest of the people around the globe  we escaped our frustrating political realities and lived a virtual  alternative life. Just like many of them  I was completely apolitical until     . At the time  when I logged into social media  I started seeing more and more Egyptians aspiring for political change in the country. It felt like I was not alone. In June       Internet changed my life forever. While browsing Facebook  I saw a photo  a terrifying photo  of a tortured  dead body of a young Egyptian guy. His name was Khaled Said. Khaled was a    year old Alexandrian who was killed by police. I saw myself in his picture. I thought   I could be Khaled.  I could not sleep that night  and I decided to do something. I anonymously created a Facebook page and called it  We are all Khaled Said.  In just three days  the page had over         people  fellow Egyptians who shared the same concern. Whatever was happening had to stop. I recruited my co admin  AbdelRahman Mansour. We worked together for hours and hours. We were crowdsourcing ideas from the people. We were engaging them. We were calling collectively for actions  and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know. The page became the most followed page in the Arab world. It had more fans than established media organizations and even top celebrities. On January           Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia after mounting protests against his regime. I saw a spark of hope. Egyptians on social media were wondering   If Tunisia did it  why can't we   I posted an event on Facebook and called it  A Revolution against Corruption  Injustice and Dictatorship.  I posed a question to the         users of the page at the time   Today is the   th of January. The   th of January is Police Day. It's a national holiday. If         of us take to the streets of Cairo  no one is going to stop us. I wonder if we could do it.  In just a few days  the invitation reached over a million people  and over         people confirmed attendance. Social media was crucial for this campaign. It helped a decentralized movement arise. It made people realize that they were not alone. And it made it impossible for the regime to stop it. At the time  they didn't even understand it. And on January   th  Egyptians flooded the streets of Cairo and other cities  calling for change  breaking the barrier of fear and announcing a new era. Then came the consequences. A few hours before the regime cut off the Internet and telecommunications  I was walking in a dark street in Cairo  around midnight. I had just tweeted   Pray for Egypt. The government must be planning a massacre tomorrow.  I was hit hard on my head. I lost my balance and fell down  to find four armed men surrounding me. One covered my mouth and the others paralyzed me. I knew I was being kidnapped by state security. I found myself in a cell  handcuffed  blindfolded. I was terrified. So was my family  who started looking for me in hospitals  police stations and even morgues. After my disappearance  a few of my fellow colleagues who knew I was the admin of the page told the media about my connection with that page  and that I was likely arrested by state security. My colleagues at Google started a search campaign trying to find me  and the fellow protesters in the square demanded my release. After    days of complete darkness  I was set free. And three days later  Mubarak was forced to step down. It was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life. It was a time of great hope. Egyptians lived a utopia for    days during the revolution. They all shared the belief that we could actually live together despite our differences  that Egypt after Mubarak would be for all. But unfortunately  the post revolution events were like a punch in the gut. The euphoria faded  we failed to build consensus  and the political struggle led to intense polarization. Social media only amplified that state  by facilitating the spread of misinformation  rumors  echo chambers and hate speech. The environment was purely toxic. My online world became a battleground filled with trolls  lies  hate speech. I started to worry about the safety of my family. But of course  this wasn't just about me. The polarization reached its peak between the two main powers    the army supporters and the Islamists. People in the center  like me  started feeling helpless. Both groups wanted you to side with them  you were either with them or against them. And on the  rd of July       the army ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president  after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation. That day I made a very hard decision. I decided to go silent  completely silent. It was a moment of defeat. I stayed silent for more than two years  and I used the time to reflect on everything that happened  trying to understand why did it happen. It became clear to me that while it's true that polarization is primarily driven by our human behavior  social media shapes this behavior and magnifies its impact. Say you want to say something that is not based on a fact  pick a fight or ignore someone that you don't like. These are all natural human impulses  but because of technology  acting on these impulses is only one click away. In my view  there are five critical challenges facing today's social media. First  we don't know how to deal with rumors. Rumors that confirm people's biases are now believed and spread among millions of people. Second  we create our own echo chambers. We tend to only communicate with people that we agree with  and thanks to social media  we can mute  un follow and block everybody else. Third  online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs. All of us probably know that. It's as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars. And fourth  it became really hard to change our opinions. Because of the speed and brevity of social media  we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in     characters about complex world affairs. And once we do that  it lives forever on the Internet  and we are less motivated to change these views  even when new evidence arises. Fifth    and in my point of view  this is the most critical    today  our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements  posts over discussions  shallow comments over deep conversations. It's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other. I witnessed how these critical challenges contributed to an already polarized Egyptian society  but this is not just about Egypt. Polarization is on the rise in the whole world. We need to work hard on figuring out how technology could be part of the solution  rather than part of the problem. There's a lot of debate today on how to combat online harassment and fight trolls. This is so important. No one could argue against that. But we need to also think about how to design social media experiences that promote civility and reward thoughtfulness. I know for a fact if I write a post that is more sensational  more one sided  sometimes angry and aggressive  I get to have more people see that post. I will get more attention. But what if we put more focus on quality  What is more important  the total number of readers of a post you write  or who are the people who have impact that read what you write  Couldn't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations  rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time  Or reward people for reading and responding to views that they disagree with  And also  make it socially acceptable that we change our minds  or probably even reward that  What if we have a matrix that says how many people changed their minds  and that becomes part of our social media experience  If I could track how many people are changing their minds  I'd probably write more thoughtfully  trying to do that  rather than appealing to the people who already agree with me and  liking  because I just confirmed their biases. We also need to think about effective crowdsourcing mechanisms  to fact check widely spread online information  and reward people who take part in that. In essence  we need to rethink today's social media ecosystem and redesign its experiences to reward thoughtfulness  civility and mutual understanding. As a believer in the Internet  I teamed up with a few friends  started a new project  trying to find answers and explore possibilities. Our first product is a new media platform for conversations. We're hosting conversations that promote mutual understanding and hopefully change minds. We don't claim to have the answers  but we started experimenting with different discussions about very divisive issues  such as race  gun control  the refugee debate  relationship between Islam and terrorism. These are conversations that matter. Today  at least one out of three people on the planet have access to the Internet. But part of this Internet is being held captive by the less noble aspects of our human behavior. Five years ago  I said   If you want to liberate society  all you need is the Internet.  Today  I believe if we want to liberate society  we first need to liberate the Internet. Thank you very much. For much of the past century  architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine.  Form follows function  had become modernity's ambitious manifesto and detrimental straitjacket  as it liberated architecture from the decorative  but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose. Of course  architecture is about function  but I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi  and I want to propose a completely different quality. If form follows fiction  we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories    stories of the people that live there  of the people that work in these buildings. And we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create. In this sense  I'm interested in fiction not as the implausible but as the real  as the reality of what architecture means for the people that live in it and with it. Our buildings are prototypes  ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different  and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today. Our buildings are real  they're being built. They're an explicit engagement in physical reality and conceptual possibility. I think of our architecture as organizational structures. At their core is indeed structural thinking  like a system  How can we arrange things in both a functional and experiential way  How can we create structures that generate a series of relationships and narratives  And how can fictive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture  while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time  And here comes the second term into play  what I call  narrative hybrids     structures of multiple simultaneous stories that unfold throughout the buildings we create. So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships  both in a programmatic and functional way and in an experiential and emotive or social way. This is the headquarters for China's national broadcaster  which I designed together with Rem Koolhaas at OMA. When I first arrived in Beijing in       the city planners showed us this image  a forest of several hundred skyscrapers to emerge in the central business district  except at that time  only a handful of them existed. So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about  except one thing  it would all be about verticality. Of course  the skyscraper is vertical    it's a profoundly hierarchical structure  the top always the best  the bottom the worst  and the taller you are  the better  so it seems. And we wanted to ask ourselves  could a building be about a completely different quality  Could it undo this hierarchy  and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration  rather than isolation  So we took this needle and bent it back into itself  into a loop of interconnected activities. Our idea was to bring all aspects of television making into one single structure  news  program production  broadcasting  research and training  administration    all into a circuit of interconnected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration. I still very much like this image. It reminds one of biology classes  if you remember the human body with all its organs and circulatory systems  like at school. And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance  but as an organism  as a life form. And as you start to dissect this organism  you can identify a series of primary technical clusters    program production  broadcasting center and news. Those are tightly intertwined with social clusters  meeting rooms  canteens  chat areas    informal spaces for people to meet and exchange. So the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social  the human and the performative. And of course  we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system  to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity. With         square meters  it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world. It has a population of over        people  and of course  this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension of many things and the scale of typical architecture. So we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut        little sticks and glued them onto a model  just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant. But of course  it's not a number  it is the people  it is a community that inhabits the building  and in order to both comprehend this  but also script this architecture  we identified five characters  hypothetical characters  and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building  thought of where they would meet  what they would experience. So it was a way to script and design the building  but of course  also to communicate its experiences. This was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art in both New York and Beijing. This is the main broadcast control room  a technical installation so large  it can broadcast over     channels simultaneously. And this is how the building stands in Beijing today. Its first broadcast live was the London Olympics       after it had been completed from the outside for the Beijing Olympics. And you can see at the very tip of this    meter cantilever  those three little circles. And they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building. They're a piece of glass that you can stand on and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion. The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing. It is there. It has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography. But its most important moment is maybe sill this one.  That's Beijing  is similar to  Time Out   a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week  and suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter  but actually as an urban actor  as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city. So architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player  of something that writes stories and performs stories. And I think that could be one of its primary meanings that we believe in. But of course  there's another story to this building. It is the story of the people that made it        engineers and architects that I was guiding over almost a decade of collaborative work that we spent together in scripting this building  in imagining its reality and ultimately getting it built in China. This is a residential development in Singapore  large scale. If we look at Singapore like most of Asia and more and more of the world  of course  it is dominated by the tower  a typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness  and I wanted to ask  how could we think about living  not only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves and our apartment  but in an idea of a collective  How could we think about creating a communal environment in which sharing things was as great as having your own  The typical answer to the question    we had to design       apartments    would have looked like this     story height limit given by the planning authorities     towers with nothing but residual in between    a very tight system that  although the tower isolates you  it doesn't even give you privacy  because you're so close to the next one  that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be. So I proposed to topple the towers  throw the vertical into the horizontal and stack them up  and what looks a bit random from the side  if you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter  you can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid  in which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up to create huge outdoor courtyards    central spaces for the community  programmed with a variety of amenities and functions. And you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces. They're open  permeable  they're interconnected. We called the project  The Interlace   thinking that we interlace and interconnect the human beings and the spaces alike. And the detailed quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants. And  in fact  it was a system where we would layer primarily communal spaces  stacked to more and more individual and private spaces. So we would open up a spectrum between the collective and the individual. A little piece of math  if we count all the green that we left on the ground  minus the footprint of the buildings  and we would add back the green of all the terraces  we have     percent green space  so more nature than not having built a building. And of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying the space available to those who live there. This is  in fact  the   th floor of one of these terraces. So you see new datum planes  new grounds planes for social activity. We paid a lot of attention to sustainability. In the tropics  the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to  and  in fact  it is seeking protection from the sun. We first proved that all apartments would have sufficient daylight through the year. We then went on to optimize the glazing of the facades to minimize the energy consumption of the building. But most importantly  we could prove that through the geometry of the building design  the building itself would provide sufficient shading to the courtyards so that those would be usable throughout the entire year. We further placed water bodies along the prevailing wind corridors  so that evaporative cooling would create microclimates that  again  would enhance the quality of those spaces available for the inhabitants. And it was the idea of creating this variety of choices  of freedom to think where you would want to be  where you would want to escape  maybe  within the own complexity of the complex in which you live. But coming from Asia to Europe  a building for a German media company based in Berlin  transitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media. And its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions  Why would anyone today still want to go to the office  because you can actually work anywhere  And how could a digital identity of a company be embodied in a building  We created not only an object  but at the center of this object we created a giant space  and this space was about the experience of a collective  the experience of collaboration and of togetherness. Communication  interaction as the center of a space that in itself would float  like what we call the collaborative cloud  in the middle of the building  surrounded by an envelope of standard modular offices. So with only a few steps from your quiet work desk  you could participate in the giant collective experience of the central space. Finally  we come to London  a project commissioned by the London Legacy Development Corporation of the Mayor of London. We were asked to undertake a study and investigate the potential of a site out in Stratford in the Olympic Park. In the   th century  Prince Albert had created Albertopolis. And Boris Johnson thought of creating Olympicopolis. The idea was to bring together some of Britain's greatest institutions  some international ones  and to create a new system of synergies. Prince Albert  as yet  created Albertopolis in the   th century  thought of showcasing all achievements of mankind  bringing arts and science closer together. And he built Exhibition Road  a linear sequence of those institutions. But of course  today's society has moved on from there. We no longer live in a world in which everything is as clearly delineated or separated from each other. We live in a world in which boundaries start to blur between the different domains  and in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important than keeping separations. So we wanted to think of a giant culture machine  a building that would orchestrate and animate the various domains  but allow them to interact and collaborate. At the base of it is a very simple module  a ring module. It can function as a double loaded corridor  has daylight  has ventilation. It can be glazed over and turned into a giant exhibitional performance space. These modules were stacked together with the idea that almost any function could  over time  occupy any of these modules. So institutions could shrink or contract  as  of course  the future of culture is  in a way  the most uncertain of all. This is how the building sits  adjacent to the Aquatics Centre  opposite the Olympic Stadium. And you can see how its cantilevering volumes project out and engage the public space and how its courtyards animate the public inside. The idea was to create a complex system in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity  in which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume. Here's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris. It both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project  but also the difference  here  it is a multiplicity of a heterogeneous structure  in which different entities can interact without losing their own identity. And it was this thought  to create an organizational structure that would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted    for those in the educational parts that create and think culture  for those that present the visual arts  the dance  and for the public to be admitted into all of this with a series of possible trajectories  to script their own reading of these narratives and their own experience. And I want to end on a project that is very small  in a way  very different  a floating cinema in the ocean of Thailand. Friends of mine had founded a film festival  and I thought  if we think of the stories and narratives of movies  we should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them. So I designed a small modular floating platform  based on the techniques of local fishermen  how they built their lobster and fish farms. We collaborated with the local community and built  out of recycled materials of their own  this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films from the British film archive          Alice in Wonderland   for example. The most primordial experiences of the audience merged with the stories of the movies. So I believe that architecture exceeds the domain of physical matter  of the built environment  but is really about how we want to live our lives  how we script our own stories and those of others. Thank you. I believe that the secret to producing extremely drought tolerant crops  which should go some way to providing food security in the world  lies in resurrection plants  pictured here  in an extremely droughted state. You might think that these plants look dead  but they're not. Give them water  and they will resurrect  green up  start growing  in    to    hours. Now  why would I suggest that producing drought tolerant crops will go towards providing food security  Well  the current world population is around   billion. And it's estimated that by       we'll be between   and    billion people  with the bulk of this growth happening in Africa. The food and agricultural organizations of the world have suggested that we need a    percent increase in current agricultural practice to meet that demand. Given that plants are at the base of the food chain  most of that's going to have to come from plants. That percentage of    percent does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change. This is taken from a study by Dai published in       where he took into consideration all the potential effects of climate change and expressed them    amongst other things    increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain. The areas in red shown here  are areas that until recently have been very successfully used for agriculture  but cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall. This is the situation that's predicted to happen in     . Much of Africa  in fact  much of the world  is going to be in trouble. We're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food. And preferably among them  some drought tolerant crops. The other thing to remember about Africa is that most of their agriculture is rainfed. Now  making drought tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world. And the reason for this is water. Water is essential to life on this planet. All living  actively metabolizing organisms  from microbes to you and I  are comprised predominately of water. All life reactions happen in water. And loss of a small amount of water results in death. You and I are    percent water    we lose one percent of that  we die. But we can make behavioral changes to avoid that. Plants can't. They're stuck in the ground. And so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us  about    percent water  and they can lose a little bit more than us  like    to about    percent  depending on the species  but for short periods only. Most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss. So extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents. They tend to be small  very attractive  but they hold onto their water at such great cost that they grow extremely slowly. Examples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs. They send down very deep roots  mine subterranean water supplies and just keep flushing it through them at all times  keeping themselves hydrated. The one on the right is called a baobab. It's also called the upside down tree  simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down. And of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant. And probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals. Annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies. Up the west coast of my country  for much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth. But come the spring rains  you get this  flowering of the desert. The strategy in annuals  is to grow only in the rainy season. At the end of that season they produce a seed  which is dry  eight to    percent water  but very much alive. And anything that is that dry and still alive  we call desiccation tolerant. In the desiccated state  what seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment for prolonged periods of time. The next time the rainy season comes  they germinate and grow  and the whole cycle just starts again. It's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation tolerant seeds allowed the colonization and the radiation of flowering plants  or angiosperms  onto land. But back to annuals as our major form of food supplies. Wheat  rice and maize form    percent of our plant food supplies. And it's been a great strategy because in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed. Seeds are energy rich so there's a lot of food calories  you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine  but there's a downside. The vegetative tissues  the roots and leaves of annuals  do not have much by way of inherent resistance  avoidance or tolerance characteristics. They just don't need them. They grow in the rainy season and they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year. And so despite concerted efforts in agriculture to make crops with improved properties of resistance  avoidance and tolerance    particularly resistance and avoidance because we've had good models to understand how those work    we still get images like this. Maize crop in Africa  two weeks without rain and it's dead. There is a solution  resurrection plants. These plants can lose    percent of their cellular water  remain in a dry  dead like state for months to years  and give them water  they green up and start growing again. Like seeds  these are desiccation tolerant. Like seeds  these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions. And this is a really rare phenomenon. There are only     flowering plant species that can do this. I'm going to show you a video of the resurrection process of these three species in that order. And at the bottom  there's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens. Pretty amazing  huh  So I've spent the last    years trying to understand how they do this. How do these plants dry without dying  And I work on a variety of different resurrection plants  shown here in the hydrated and dry states  for a number of reasons. One of them is that each of these plants serves as a model for a crop that I'd like to make drought tolerant. So on the extreme top left  for example  is a grass  it's called Eragrostis nindensis  it's got a close relative called Eragrostis tef    a lot of you might know it as  teff     it's a staple food in Ethiopia  it's gluten free  and it's something we would like to make drought tolerant. The other reason for looking at a number of plants  is that  at least initially  I wanted to find out  do they do the same thing  Do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to lose all that water and not die  So I undertook what we call a systems biology approach in order to get a comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance  in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant  ecophysiological level. For example we look at things like changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out and their ultrastructure. We look at the transcriptome  which is just a term for a technology in which we look at the genes that are switched on or off  in response to drying. Most genes will code for proteins  so we look at the proteome. What are the proteins made in response to drying  Some proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites  so we look at the metabolome. Now  this is important because plants are stuck in the ground. They use what I call a highly tuned chemical arsenal to protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment. So it's important that we look at the chemical changes involved in drying. And at the last study that we do at the molecular level  we look at the lipidome    the lipid changes in response to drying. And that's also important because all biological membranes are made of lipids. They're held as membranes because they're in water. Take away the water  those membranes fall apart. Lipids also act as signals to turn on genes. Then we use physiological and biochemical studies to try and understand the function of the putative protectants that we've actually discovered in our other studies. And then use all of that to try and understand how the plant copes with its natural environment. I've always had the philosophy that I needed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application. I'm sure some of you are thinking   By biotic application  does she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops   And the answer to that question is  depends on your definition of genetic modification. All of the crops that we eat today  wheat  rice and maize  are highly genetically modified from their ancestors  but we don't consider them GM because they're being produced by conventional breeding. If you mean  am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops  your answer is yes. In the essence of time  we have tried that approach. More appropriately  some of my collaborators at UCT  Jennifer Thomson  Suhail Rafudeen  have spearheaded that approach and I'm going to show you some data soon. But we're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach  in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes that are already present in every crop. They're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions. I leave it up to you to decide whether those should be called GM or not. I'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach. And in order to do that I have to explain a little bit about how genes work. So you probably all know that genes are made of double stranded DNA. It's wound very tightly into chromosomes that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant's body. If you unwind that DNA  you get genes. And each gene has a promoter  which is just an on off switch  the gene coding region  and then a terminator  which indicates that this is the end of this gene  the next gene will start. Now  promoters are not simple on off switches. They normally require a lot of fine tuning  lots of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on. So what's typically done in biotech studies is that we use an inducible promoter  we know how to switch it on. We couple that to genes of interest and put that into a plant and see how the plant responds. In the study that I'm going to talk to you about  my collaborators used a drought induced promoter  which we discovered in a resurrection plant. The nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing. The plant itself senses drought. And we've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants. Why antioxidant genes  Well  all stresses  particularly drought stress  results in the formation of free radicals  or reactive oxygen species  which are highly damaging and can cause crop death. What antioxidants do is stop that damage. So here's some data from a maize strain that's very popularly used in Africa. To the left of the arrow are plants without the genes  to the right    plants with the antioxidant genes. After three weeks without watering  the ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better. Now to the final approach. My research has shown that there's considerable similarity in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants. So I ask the question  are they using the same genes  Or slightly differently phrased  are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves  Have they retasked these seed genes in roots and leaves of resurrection plants  And I answer that question  as a consequence of a lot of research from my group and recent collaborations from a group of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands  Mel Oliver in the United States and Julia Buitink in France. The answer is yes  that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both. And I'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize  where the chromosomes below the off switch represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance. So as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development  they switch these genes on. Resurrection plants switch on the same genes when they dry out. All modern crops  therefore  have these genes in their roots and leaves  they just never switch them on. They only switch them on in seed tissues. So what we're trying to do right now is to understand the environmental and cellular signals that switch on these genes in resurrection plants  to mimic the process in crops. And just a final thought. What we're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants some    to    million years ago. My plants and I thank you for your attention. I have a question. Can a computer write poetry  This is a provocative question. You think about it for a minute  and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like  What is a computer  What is poetry  What is creativity  But these are questions that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer  not in a single TED Talk. So we're going to have to try a different approach. So up here  we have two poems. One of them is written by a human  and the other one's written by a computer. I'm going to ask you to tell me which one's which. Have a go  Poem    Little Fly   Thy summer's play    My thoughtless hand   Has brush'd away. Am I not   A fly like thee    Or art not thou   A man like me  Poem    We can feel   Activist through your life's   morning   Pauses to see  pope I hate the   Non all the night to start a   great otherwise  ...  Alright  time's up. Hands up if you think Poem   was written by a human. OK  most of you. Hands up if you think Poem   was written by a human. Very brave of you  because the first one was written by the human poet William Blake. The second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically  according to methods that I'll describe a little bit later on. So let's try another test. Again  you haven't got ages to read this  so just trust your gut. Poem    A lion roars and a dog barks. It is interesting   and fascinating that a bird will fly and not   roar or bark. Enthralling stories about animals are in my dreams and I will sing them all if I   am not exhausted or weary. Poem    Oh  kangaroos  sequins  chocolate sodas    You are really beautiful  Pearls    harmonicas  jujubes  aspirins  All   the stuff they've always talked about  ...  Alright  time's up. So if you think the first poem was written by a human  put your hand up. OK. And if you think the second poem was written by a human  put your hand up. We have  more or less  a       split here. It was much harder. The answer is  the first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter  that was created back in the     s  and the second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara  who happens to be one of my favorite human poets. So what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry. The Turing test was first proposed by this guy  Alan Turing  in       in order to answer the question  can computers think  Alan Turing believed that if a computer was able to have a to have a text based conversation with a human  with such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell whether they are talking to a computer or a human  then the computer can be said to have intelligence. So in       my friend Benjamin Laird and I  we created a Turing test for poetry online. It's called bot or not  and you can go and play it for yourselves. But basically  it's the game we just played. You're presented with a poem  you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer and you have to guess. So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online  so we have results. And what are the results  Well  Turing said that if a computer could fool a human    percent of the time that it was a human  then it passes the Turing test for intelligence. We have poems on the bot or not database that have fooled    percent of human readers into thinking it was written by a human. So  I think we have an answer to our question. According to the logic of the Turing test  can a computer write poetry  Well  yes  absolutely it can. But if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer  that's OK. If you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it  that's also OK because this isn't the end of the story. Let's play our third and final test. Again  you're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human. Poem    Reg flags the reason for pretty flags.   And ribbons. Ribbons of flags   And wearing material   Reasons for wearing material.  ...  Poem    A wounded deer leaps highest    I've heard the daffodil I've heard the flag to day   I've heard the hunter tell    'Tis but the ecstasy of death    And then the brake is almost done  ...  OK  time is up. So hands up if you think Poem   was written by a human. Hands up if you think Poem   was written by a human. Whoa  that's a lot more people. So you'd be surprised to find that Poem   was written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein. And Poem   was generated by an algorithm called RKCP. Now before we go on  let me describe very quickly and simply  how RKCP works. So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil  who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence. So  you give RKCP a source text  it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language  and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text. So in the poem we just saw before  Poem    the one that you all thought was human  it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language  learned the model  and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure. But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using. The language is just raw material  it could be Chinese  it could be in Swedish  it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day. It's just raw material. And nevertheless  it's able to create a poem that seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem  and Gertrude Stein is a human. So what we've done here is  more or less  a reverse Turing test. So Gertrude Stein  who's a human  is able to write a poem that fools a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer. Therefore  according to the logic of the reverse Turing test  Gertrude Stein is a computer. Feeling confused  I think that's fair enough. So far we've had humans that write like humans  we have computers that write like computers  we have computers that write like humans  but we also have  perhaps most confusingly  humans that write like computers. So what do we take from all of this  Do we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human than Gertrude Stein  Or that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake  These are questions I've been asking myself for around two years now  and I don't have any answers. But what I do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology. So my first insight is that  for some reason  we associate poetry with being human. So that when we ask   Can a computer write poetry   we're also asking   What does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category  How do we say who or what can be part of this category   This is an essentially philosophical question  I believe  and it can't be answered with a yes or no test  like the Turing test. I also believe that Alan Turing understood this  and that when he devised his test back in       he was doing it as a philosophical provocation. So my second insight is that  when we take the Turing test for poetry  we're not really testing the capacity of the computers because poetry generating algorithms  they're pretty simple and have existed  more or less  since the     s. What we are doing with the Turing test for poetry  rather  is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness. So  what I've figured out  we've seen this when earlier today  we say that William Blake is more of a human than Gertrude Stein. Of course  this doesn't mean that William Blake was actually more human or that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer. It simply means that the category of the human is unstable. This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold  hard fact. Rather  it is something that's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time. So my final insight is that the computer  more or less  works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it. We show it Emily Dickinson  it gives Emily Dickinson back to us. We show it William Blake  that's what it reflects back to us. We show it Gertrude Stein  what we get back is Gertrude Stein. More than any other bit of technology  the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it. So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently. And much of the conversation is  can we build it  Can we build an intelligent computer  Can we build a creative computer  What we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human like computer  But what we've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact  that it's an ever shifting  concatenating idea and one that changes over time. So that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future  we shouldn't only be asking ourselves   Can we build it   But we should also be asking ourselves   What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us   This is an essentially philosophical idea  and it's one that can't be answered with software alone  but I think requires a moment of species wide  existential reflection. Thank you. Welcome to Bayeku  a riverine community in Ikorodu  Lagos    a vivid representation of several riverine communities across Nigeria  communities whose waterways have been infested by an invasive aquatic weed  communities where economic livelihoods have been hampered  fishing  marine transportation and trading  communities where fish yields have diminished  communities where schoolchildren are unable to go to school for days  sometimes weeks  on end. Who would have thought that this plant with round leaves  inflated stems  and showy  lavender flowers would cause such havoc in these communities. The plant is known as water hyacinth and its botanical name  Eichhornia crassipes. Interestingly  in Nigeria  the plant is also known by other names  names associated with historical events  as well as myths. In some places  the plant is called Babangida. When you hear Babangida  you remember the military and military coups. And you think  fear  restraint. In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta  the plant is also known as Abiola. When you hear Abiola  you remember annulled elections and you think  dashed hopes. In the southwestern part of Nigeria  the plant is known as Gbe'borun. Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase which translates to  gossip   or  talebearer.  When you think of gossip  you think  rapid reproduction  destruction. And in the Igala speaking part of Nigeria  the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma  And when you hear that  you think of death. It literally translates to  death to mother and child.  I personally had my encounter with this plant in the year     . It was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria. I'd quit my job in corporate America and decided to take this big leap of faith  a leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction that there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria in the area of sustainable development. And so here I was in the year       actually  at the end of       in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge. And I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image. It was an image of fishing boats that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth. And I was really pained by what I saw because I thought to myself   These poor fisherfolk  how are they going to go about their daily activities with these restrictions.  And then I thought   There's got to be a better way.  A win win solution whereby the environment is taken care of by the weeds being cleared out of the way and then this being turned into an economic benefit for the communities whose lives are impacted the most by the infestation of the weed. That  I would say  was my spark moment. And so I did further research to find out more about the beneficial uses of this weed. Out of the several  one struck me the most. It was the use of the plant for handicrafts. And I thought   What a great idea.  Personally  I love handicrafts  especially handicrafts that are woven around a story. And so I thought   This could be easily deployed within the communities without the requirement of technical skills.  And I thought to myself   Three simple steps to a mega solution.  First step  Get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth. That way  you create access. Secondly  you dry the water hyacinth stems. And thirdly  you weave the water hyacinth into products. The third step was a challenge. See  I'm a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts. And so I began my quest to find out how I can learn how to weave. And this quest took me to a community in Ibadan  where I lived  called Sabo. Sabo translates to  strangers' quarters.  And the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country. So I literally took my dried weeds in hand  there were several more of them  and went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes. And I was directed to the shed of Malam Yahaya. The problem  though  is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English and neither did I speak Hausa. But some little kids came to the rescue and helped translate. And that began my journey of learning how to weave and transform these dried water hyacinth stems into long ropes. With my long ropes in hand  I was now equipped to make products. And that was the beginning of partnerships. Working with rattan basket makers to come up with products. So with this in hand  I felt confident that I would be able to take this knowledge back into the riverine communities and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity. So taking these weeds and actually weaving them into products that can be sold. So we have pens  we have tableware  we have purses  we have tissue boxes. Thereby  helping the communities to see water hyacinth in a different light. Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable  being aesthetic  being durable  tough  resilient. Changing names  changing livelihoods. From Gbe'borun  gossip  to Olusotan  storyteller. And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma  which is  killer of mother and child   to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma   provider of food for mother and child.  And I'd like to end with a quote by Michael Margolis. He said   If you want to learn about a culture  listen to the stories. And if you want to change a culture  change the stories.  And so  from Makoko community  to Abobiri  to Ewoi  to Kolo  to Owahwa  Esaba  we have changed the story. Thank you for listening. Imagine you're in Rome  and you've made your way to the Vatican Museums. And you've been shuffling down long corridors  past statues  frescoes  lots and lots of stuff. You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel. At last    a long corridor  a stair and a door. You're at the threshold of the Sistine Chapel. So what are you expecting  Soaring domes  Choirs of angels  We don't really have any of that there. Instead  you may ask yourself  what do we have  Well  curtains up on the Sistine Chapel. And I mean literally  you're surrounded by painted curtains  the original decoration of this chapel. Churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses  but as a way to represent the great theater of life. The human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story  a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfold in the three stages of the painting in the Sistine Chapel. Now  this building started out as a space for a small group of wealthy  educated Christian priests. They prayed there. They elected their pope there. Five hundred years ago  it was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave. So  you may ask  how can it be that today it attracts and delights five million people a year  from all different backgrounds  Because in that compressed space  there was a creative explosion  ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers  which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the Church and produced one of the greatest works of art in history. Now  this development took place as a great evolution  moving from the beginning of a few elite  and eventually able to speak to audiences of people that come from all over the world. This evolution took place in three stages  each one linked to a historical circumstance. The first one was rather limited in scope. It reflected the rather parochial perspective. The second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered after Columbus's historical voyage  and the third  when the Age of Discovery was well under way and the Church rose to the challenge of going global. The original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world. There were busy scenes that told the stories of the lives of Jesus and Moses  reflecting the development of the Jewish and Christian people. The man who commissioned this  Pope Sixtus IV  assembled a dream team of Florentine art  including men like Sandro Botticelli and the man who would become Michelangelo's future painting teacher  Ghirlandaio. These men  they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color  and in these stories you'll notice familiar landscapes  the artists using Roman monuments or a Tuscan landscape to render a faraway story  something much more familiar. With the addition of images of the Pope's friends and family  this was a perfect decoration for a small court limited to the European continent. But in       the New World was discovered  horizons were expanding  and this little     by    foot microcosm had to expand as well. And it did  thanks to a creative genius  a visionary and an awesome story. Now  the creative genius was Michelangelo Buonarroti     years old when he was tapped to decorate        square feet of ceiling  and the deck was stacked against him    he had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture. There were angry patrons in Florence because he had left a stack of incomplete commissions  lured to Rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project  and that project had fallen through. And he had been left with a commission to paint    apostles against a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling  which would look like every other ceiling in Italy. But genius rose to the challenge. In an age when a man dared to sail across the Atlantic Ocean  Michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters. He  too  would tell a story    no Apostles    but a story of great beginnings  the story of Genesis. Not really an easy sell  stories on a ceiling. How would you be able to read a busy scene from    feet below  The painting technique that had been handed on for     years in Florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative. But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter  and so he played to his strengths. Instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness  he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within. Michelangelo was an essentialist  he would tell his story in massive  dynamic bodies. This plan was embraced by the larger than life Pope Julius II  a man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius. He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV  and he had been steeped in art for    years and he knew its power. And history has handed down the moniker of the Warrior Pope  but this man's legacy to the Vatican    it wasn't fortresses and artillery  it was art. He left us the Raphael Rooms  the Sistine Chapel. He left St. Peter's Basilica as well as an extraordinary collection of Greco Roman sculptures    decidedly un Christian works that would become the seedbed of the world's first modern museum  the Vatican Museums. Julius was a man who envisioned a Vatican that would be eternally relevant through grandeur and through beauty  and he was right. The encounter between these two giants  Michelangelo and Julius II  that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo was so committed to this project  that he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years  using a skeleton crew and spending most of the time  hours on end  reaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling. So let's look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global. No more familiar artistic references to the world around you. There's just space and structure and energy  a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels  more driven by sculptural form than painterly color. And we stand in the far end by the entrance  far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy and we peer into the distance  looking for a beginning. And whether in scientific inquiry or in biblical tradition  we think in terms of a primal spark. Michelangelo gave us an initial energy when he gave us the separation of light and dark  a churning figure blurry in the distance  compressed into a tight space. The next figure looms larger  and you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next. He leaves in his wake the sun  the moon  vegetation. Michelangelo didn't focus on the stuff that was being created  unlike all the other artists. He focused on the act of creation. And then the movement stops  like a caesura in poetry and the creator hovers. So what's he doing  Is he creating land  Is he creating sea  Or is he looking back over his handiwork  the universe and his treasures  just like Michelangelo must have  looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming   It is good.  So now the scene is set  and you get to the culmination of creation  which is man. Adam leaps to the eye  a light figure against a dark background. But looking closer  that leg is pretty languid on the ground  the arm is heavy on the knee. Adam lacks that interior spark that will impel him to greatness. That spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger  which is one millimeter from the hand of Adam. It puts us at the edge of our seats  because we're one moment from that contact  through which that man will discover his purpose  leap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation. And then Michelangelo threw a curveball. Who is in that other arm  Eve  first woman. No  she's not an afterthought. She's part of the plan. She's always been in his mind. Look at her  so intimate with God that her hand curls around his arm. And for me  an American art historian from the   st century  this was the moment that the painting spoke to me. Because I realized that this representation of the human drama was always about men and women    so much so  that the dead center  the heart of the ceiling  is the creation of woman  not Adam. And the fact is  that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden  they fall together and together their proud posture turns into folded shame. You are at critical juncture now in the ceiling. You are exactly at the point where you and I can go no further into the church. The gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum  and we are cast out much like Adam and Eve. The remaining scenes in the ceiling  they mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us. You have Noah and his Ark and the flood. You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice and a covenant with God. Maybe he's the savior. Oh  but no  Noah is the one who grew grapes  invented wine  got drunk and passed out naked in his barn. It is a curious way to design the ceiling  now starting out with God creating life  ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn. And so  compared with Adam  you might think Michelangelo is making fun of us. But he's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath Noah  emerald  topaz  scarlet on the prophet Zechariah. Zechariah foresees a light coming from the east  and we are turned at this juncture to a new destination  with sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade. You have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way  and we follow the mothers and fathers. They are the motors of this great human engine  driving it forward. And now we're at the keystone of the ceiling  the culmination of the whole thing  with a figure that looks like he's about to fall out of his space into our space  encroaching our space. This is the most important juncture. Past meets present. This figure  Jonah  who spent three days in the belly of the whale  for the Christians  is the symbol of the renewal of humanity through Jesus' sacrifice  but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum from all faiths who visit there every day  he is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality. All of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall  where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment  painted in      after the world had changed again. The Reformation had splintered the Church  the Ottoman Empire had made Islam a household word and Magellan had found a route into the Pacific Ocean. How is a    year old artist who has never been any further than Venice going to speak to this new world  Michelangelo chose to paint destiny  that universal desire  common to all of us  to leave a legacy of excellence. Told in terms of the Christian vision of the Last Judgment  the end of the world  Michelangelo gave you a series of figures who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies. They have no more covers  no more portraits except for a couple. It's a composition only out of bodies       no two alike  unique like each and every one of us. They start in the lower corner  breaking away from the ground  struggling and trying to rise. Those who have risen reach back to help others  and in one amazing vignette  you have a black man and a white man pulled up together in an incredible vision of human unity in this new world. The lion's share of the space goes to the winner's circle. There you find men and women completely nude like athletes. They are the ones who have overcome adversity  and Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity  overcome obstacles    they're just like athletes. So you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight. Presiding over this assembly is Jesus  first a suffering man on the cross  now a glorious ruler in Heaven. And as Michelangelo proved in his painting  hardship  setbacks and obstacles  they don't limit excellence  they forge it. Now  this does lead us to one odd thing. This is the Pope's private chapel  and the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes. But Michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language  the most universal artistic language he could think of  that of the human body. And so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self mastery  he borrowed from Julius II's wonderful collection of sculptures in order to show inner strength as external power. Now  one contemporary did write that the chapel was too beautiful to not cause controversy. And so it did. Michelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press  complaints about the nudity spread all over the place  and soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography  at which point he added two more portraits  one of the man who criticized him  a papal courtier  and the other one of himself as a dried up husk  no athlete  in the hands of a long suffering martyr. The year he died he saw several of these figures covered over  a triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory. And so now we stand in the here and now. We are caught in that space between beginnings and endings  in the great  huge totality of the human experience. The Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror. Who am I in this picture  Am I one of the crowd  Am I the drunk guy  Am I the athlete  And as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty  we are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions  Who am I  and what role do I play in this great theater of life  Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Elizabeth Lev  thank you. Elizabeth  you mentioned this whole issue of pornography  too many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things in the eyes of the time. But actually the story is bigger. It's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures. This work of art was almost destroyed because of that. Elizabeth Lev  The effect of the Last Judgment was enormous. The printing press made sure that everybody saw it. And so  this wasn't something that happened within a couple of weeks. It was something that happened over the space of    years of editorials and complaints  saying to the Church   You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives. Did you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel   And so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed  it was finally the year that Michelangelo died that the Church finally found a compromise  a way to save the painting  and that was in putting up these extra    covers  and that happens to be the origin of fig leafing. That's where it all came about  and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art  not indeed deface or destroyed it. BG  This  what you just gave us  is not the classic tour that people get today when they go to the Sistine Chapel. EL  I don't know  is that an ad  BG  No  no  no  not necessarily  it is a statement. The experience of art today is encountering problems. Too many people want to see this there  and the result is five million people going through that tiny door and experiencing it in a completely different way than we just did. EL  Right. I agree. I think it's really nice to be able to pause and look. But also realize  even when you're in those days  with        people a day  even those days when you're in there with all those other people  look around you and think how amazing it is that some painted plaster from     years ago can still draw all those people standing side by side with you  looking upwards with their jaws dropped. It's a great statement about how beauty truly can speak to us all through time and through geographic space. BG  Liz  grazie. EL  Grazie a te. BG  Thank you. Democracy. In the West  we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted. We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is  but we see it as part of our society's furniture. We tend to think of it as an intransigent given. We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy. It doesn't. Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism  spectacular growth  while politics remains democracy free. Indeed  democracy is receding in our neck of the woods  here in Europe. Earlier this year  while I was representing Greece    the newly elected Greek government    in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister  I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process    our elections    could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece. At that moment  I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew  or the Chinese Communist Party  indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything. Tonight  here  I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy. I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew  the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy    that we need an authentic  boisterous democracy. And without democracy  our societies will be nastier  our future bleak and our great  new technologies wasted. Speaking of waste  allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak. I call it the twin peaks paradox. One peak you understand    you know it  you recognize it    is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow over the United States  Europe  the whole world. We all recognize the mountain of debts. But few people discern its twin. A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations  too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs  like green energy. Now let me give you two numbers. Over the last three months  in the United States  in Britain and in the Eurozone  we have invested  collectively   .  trillion dollars on all the wealth producing goods    things like industrial plants  machinery  office blocks  schools  roads  railways  machinery  and so on and so forth.   .  trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the   .  trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries  in our financial institutions  doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices. So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks   failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets. The result is stagnant wages  more than a quarter of     to    year olds in America  in Japan and in Europe out of work. And consequently  low aggregate demand  which in a never ending cycle  reinforces the pessimism of the investors  who  fearing low demand  reproduce it by not investing    exactly like Oedipus' father  who  terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him  unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that Oedipus  his son  would kill him. This is my quarrel with capitalism. Its gross wastefulness  all this idle cash  should be energized to improve lives  to develop human talents  and indeed to finance all these technologies  green technologies  which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth. Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer  I believe so  but before we move on  what do we mean by democracy  Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor  being in the majority  control government. Now  of course Athenian democracy excluded too many. Women  migrants and  of course  the slaves. But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded. What was more pertinent  and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy  was the inclusion of the working poor  who not only acquired the right to free speech  but more importantly  crucially  they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision making concerning matters of state. Now  of course  Athenian democracy didn't last long. Like a candle that burns brightly  it burned out quickly. And indeed  our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens. They have their roots in the Magna Carta  in the      Glorious Revolution  indeed in the American constitution. Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor  our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition  which was  after all  a charter for masters. And indeed  liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere  so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere  leaving the economic sphere    the corporate world  if you want    as a democracy free zone. Now  in our democracies today  this separation of the economic from the political sphere  the moment it started happening  it gave rise to an inexorable  epic struggle between the two  with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere  eating into its power. Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be  It's not because their DNA has degenerated. It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power  because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere  which is separate. Indeed  I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism. If you think about it  it is a little bit like a population of predators  that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on  that in the end they starve. Similarly  the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself  causing economic crisis. Corporate power is increasing  political goods are devaluing  inequality is rising  aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations. So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy  the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity's wealth. Clearly  if this is right  we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control  like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants. Now  this is not an original idea. The Marxist left had that idea     years ago and it didn't go very well  did it  The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered  as they were in ancient Athens  without creating new forms of brutality and waste. But there is a solution  eliminate the working poor. Capitalism's doing it by replacing low wage workers with automata  androids  robots. The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate  automation makes the twin peaks taller  the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper  including    soon  I believe    in places like China. So we need to reconfigure  we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres  but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere  lest we end up with a surveillance mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix  the movie  look like a documentary. So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning. The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek like society  where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient  Athenian like  high tech agora. I think we can afford to be optimistic. But what would it take  what would it look like to have this Star Trek like utopia  instead of the Matrix like dystopia  In practical terms  allow me to share just briefly  a couple of examples. At the level of the enterprise  imagine a capital market  where you earn capital as you work  and where your capital follows you from one job to another  from one company to another  and the company    whichever one you happen to work at at that time    is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment. Then all income stems from capital  from profits  and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete. No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company  no more tug of war between capital and labor  no great gap between investment and saving  indeed  no towering twin peaks. At the level of the global political economy  imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free floating exchange rate  with a universal  global  digital currency  one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund  the G     on behalf of all humanity. And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency    let's call it  the cosmos   in units of cosmos    with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit  or indeed to a country's trade surplus. And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies  especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce. This is not a new idea. It's what  effectively  John Maynard Keynes proposed in      at the Bretton Woods Conference. The problem is that back then  they didn't have the technology to implement it. Now we do  especially in the context of a reunified political economic sphere. The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian  in that it prioritizes empowered individuals  Marxist  since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor  and Keynesian  global Keynesian. But above all else  it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy. Will such a world dawn  Or shall we descend into a Matrix like dystopia  The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively. It is our choice  and we'd better make it democratically. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Yanis ... It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist. What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today  Yanis Varoufakis  Well  if there was any relevance in what I just said  then Marx is relevant. Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is    if we don't do it  then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand  what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation. With this crisis migrating from one part of the world  as it is now  it will destabilize not only our democracies  but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy. So if this analysis holds water  then Marx is absolutely relevant. But so is Hayek  that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist  and so is Keynes  so that's why I'm totally confused. BG  Indeed  and possibly we are too  now. YV  If you are not confused  you are not thinking  OK  BG  That's a very  very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say    YV  That was Einstein  actually    BG  During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China  and last night at the speaker dinner  you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China. Would you like to share that  YV  Well  there's a great degree of hypocrisy. In our liberal democracies  we have a semblance of democracy. It's because we have confined  as I was saying in my talk  democracy to the political sphere  while leaving the one sphere where all the action is    the economic sphere    a completely democracy free zone. In a sense  if I am allowed to be provocative  China today is closer to Britain in the   th century. Because remember  we tend to associate liberalism with democracy    that's a mistake  historically. Liberalism  liberal  it's like John Stuart Mill. John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process. So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution  especially the transition from the first to the second. And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the   th century  smacks of hypocrisy. BG  I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year. YV  I knew this was coming. BG  Yes. BG  Six months after  how do you look back at the first half of the year  YV  Extremely exciting  from a personal point of view  and very disappointing  because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone. Not just Greece  the Eurozone. To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive    and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone  which is threatening  massively  the whole of the European Union process. We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program    which by the way  was the first program to manifest that denial    to put it right. And  unfortunately  the powers in the Eurozone  in the Eurogroup  chose to maintain denial. But you know what happens. This is the experience of the Soviet Union. When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive  through political will and through authoritarianism  you may succeed in prolonging it  but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically. BG  What kind of change are you foreseeing  YV  Well  there's no doubt that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone  the Eurozone has no future. BG  Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister  YV  Every day. BG  For example  YV  Anybody who looks back    No  but seriously. If there's any Minister of Finance  or of anything else for that matter  who tells you after six months in a job  especially in such a stressful situation  that they have made no mistake  they're dangerous people. Of course I made mistakes. The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February. I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground. And there wasn't. They were simply interested in crushing our government  just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone. And because they didn't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece. We lost one third of our nominal GDP. This is worse than the Great Depression. And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say   This was a colossal mistake.  BG  Despite all this  and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion  you seem to be remaining quite pro European. YV  Absolutely. Look  my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe. My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive. Because if it doesn't  the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic  and they will destroy the European Union. And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy. We are probably the largest economy in the world. And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern     's  which seems to me to be what we are doing  then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non Europeans alike. BG  We definitely hope you are wrong on that point. Yanis  thank you for coming to TED. YV  Thank you. I'm a marine biologist and an explorer photographer with National Geographic  but I want to share a secret. This image is totally incorrect  totally incorrect. I see a couple of people crying in the back that I've blown their idea of mermaids. All right  the mermaid is indeed real  but anyone who's gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this. It's because the ocean is this massive filter  and as soon as you start going underwater  you're going to lose your colors  and it's going to get dark and blue very quickly. But we're humans    we're terrestrial mammals. And we've got trichromatic vision  so we see in red  green and blue  and we're just complete color addicts. We love eye popping color  and we try to bring this eye popping color underwater with us. So there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater  and it starts    years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin  who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph. And they're in there with old school scuba suits  where you're pumping air down to them  and they've got a pontoon of high explosive magnesium powder  and the poor people at the surface are not sure when they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus  and    boom     a pound of high explosives would go off so they could put a little bit of light underwater and get an image like this beautiful hogfish. I mean  it's a gorgeous image  but this is not real. They're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color. And looking at it the other way  what we've been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us  that we've been looking at the blue ocean  and it's a crucible of blue  and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other colors. And here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like. It's like an underwater light show. Again  what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image. These animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light. So if you think about it  the ocean is    percent of the planet  and blue light can extend down to almost a       meters. As we go down underwater  after about    meters  all the red is gone. So if you see anything under    meters that's red  it's an animal transforming and creating its own red. This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet. And my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals. And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals and just how cool these things are. One of the things that they do  one of their miraculous feats  is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins  fluorescent molecules. And in this coral  it could be making up to    percent of its body mass    could be this fluorescent protein. So you wouldn't be making  like     percent muscle and not using it  so it's likely doing something that has a functional role. And for the last        years  this was so special to me  because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools in biomedical science  and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves. So  how do I study this  In order to study biofluorescence  we swim at night. And when I started out  I was just using these blue duct tape filters over my strobe  so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light that's being transformed by the animals. We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History  and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef  and something happened that just blew me away  this. In the middle of our corals  is this green fluorescent fish. It's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish or any vertebrate for that matter. And we're rubbing our eyes  checking the filters  thinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera  but the eel was real. It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found  and this just changed my trajectory completely. So I had to put down my corals and team up with a fish scientist  John Sparks  and begin a search around the world to see how prevalent this phenomenon is. And fish are much more interesting than corals  because they have really advanced vision  and some of the fish even have  the way that I was photographing it  they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence. So I wanted to seek this out further. So we designed a new set of gear and we're scouring the reefs around the world  looking for fluorescent life. And it's a bit like  E.T. phone home.  We're out there swimming with this blue light  and we're looking for a response  for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us. And eventually  we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel. It's a really shy  reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about. They're only about the size of my finger  and they spend about   .  percent of their time hidden under a rock. But these eels do come out to mate under full moon nights  and that full moon night translates underwater to blue. Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other  quickly find each other  mate  go back into their hole for the next long stint of time. But then we started to find other fluorescent marine life  like this green fluorescent bream  with its  like  racing stripes along its head and its nape  and it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there. After this fish  we were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish cloaked and hidden on this rock. The only time we've ever seen this  it's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral. Later  we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish. These lizardfish come in many varieties  and they look almost exactly alike under white light. But if you look at them under fluorescent light  you see lots of patterns  you can really see the differences among them. And in total    we just reported this last year    we found over     species of biofluorescent fish. One of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlev . He really captures this entrepreneuring  creative spirit in biology. He would design his own gear  make his own cameras  and he was fascinated with the seahorse  Hippocampus erectus  and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth. So this is the male seahorse. They were one of the first fish to start swimming upright with their brain above their head. The males give birth  just phenomenal creatures. So he stayed awake for days. He even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him  so he could capture this moment. Now  I wish I could have shown Painlev  the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses in the exact same species that he was studying. And here's our footage. They're the most cryptic fish. You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse. They would blend right into the algae  which would also fluoresce red  but they've got great vision  and they go through this long mating ritual  and perhaps they're using it in that effect. But things got pretty edgy when we found green fluorescence in the stingray  because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class  which includes ... sharks. So I'm  like  a coral biologist. Somebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent. And there I am. And I was like   Maybe I should go back to corals.  It turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent. And then we found it. In a deep  dark canyon off the coast of California  we found the first biofluorescent swellshark  right underneath all the surfers. Here it is. They're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark. And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened  they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube  about twice their size  and wedge themselves under a rock  so they don't get eaten by a predator. And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks. Just magnificent    I mean  they're showing these distinct patterns  and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent  but they've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark. But this is all beautiful to see. I was like  this is gorgeous. But what does it mean to the shark  Can they see this  And we looked in the literature  and nothing was known about this shark's vision. So I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University  and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely in the blue green interface  probably about     times better than we can see in the dark  but they only see blue green. So what it's doing is taking this blue world and it's absorbing the blue  creating green. It's creating contrast that they can indeed see. So we have a model  showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns. And males and females also have  we're finding  distinct patterns among them. But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now  in the Solomon Islands. Swimming at night  I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle. So now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles  which  again  this is only one month old  but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle's vision. And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn. And here in the Solomon Islands  there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left  and this is one of the hotspots for them. So it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they're still here  and understand them. In thinking about biofluorescence  I wanted to know  how deep does it go  Does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean  So we started using submarines  and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here. And we dropped down  and we noticed one important thing    that as we get down to       meters  it drops off. There's no biofluorescent marine life down there  below       meters    almost nothing  it's just darkness. So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon. And below       meters  we encountered the bioluminescent zone  where nine out of    animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking. As I try to get deeper  this is slapping on a one person submarine suit    some people call this my  Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen  moment. But as we explore down here  I was thinking about  How do we interact with life delicately  Because we're entering a new age of exploration  where we have to take great care  and we have to set examples how we explore. So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University  and we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers  so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there. The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military  who  you know  they're not really caring to be gentle. Some corals could be       years old. You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw. So my dream is something like this. At night  I'm in a submarine  I have force feedback gloves  and I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine  where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars  and we can conduct our research. Back to the powerful applied applications. Here  you're looking at a living brain that's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures  this one from jellyfish and corals  to illuminate the living brain and see its connections. It's funny that we're using RGB just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition  so we can see our brains better. And even more mind blowing  is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale  who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein that responds to voltage. So he could see when a single neuron fires. You're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness that was designed by marine creatures. So this brings me all back to perspective and relationship. From deep space  our universe looks like a human brain cell  and then here we are in the deep ocean  and we're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind. And it's my hope that with illuminated minds  we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life  and fathom how much more lies in store if we keep our oceans healthy. Thank you. It was an afternoon in the fall of     . I was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor. I really  really loved my job  but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged. So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office. Chris had been at the ACLU for more than    years  so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights. I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck. I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties    super interesting. But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way  in a way that could really make a difference. So Chris cut right to the chase  and he says   Well  of all the issues you've been looking at  what are the top five    Well  there's genetic discrimination  and reproductive technologies  and biobanking  and ... oh  there's this really cool issue  functional MRI and using it for lie detection  and ... oh  and of course  there's gene patents.   Gene patents    Yes  you know  patents on human genes.   No  You're telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body  That can't be right.  I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles. And    minutes later  he came bursting in my office.  Oh my god  You're right  Who can we sue   Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer  but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics. I knew something about genetics  but I wasn't even a lawyer  let alone a patent lawyer. So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit. First  we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene. Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims  but the most controversial of these are to so called  isolated DNA     namely  a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell. Gene patent proponents say   See  We didn't patent the gene in your body  we patented an isolated gene.  And that's true  but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated. And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated  but on every possible version of that gene. So what does that mean  That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it  say  to see if it has any mutations  without permission of the patent holder. It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing. Allowing patent holders  often private companies  to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients. Consider Abigail  a    year old with long QT syndrome  a serious heart condition that  if left untreated  can result in sudden death. The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome. But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it. So another lab tried to offer the test  but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement. So as a result  for   years  no test was available. During that time  Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT. Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients. But was there a way we could challenge them  Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases  that certain things are not patent eligible. You can't patent products of nature    the air  the water  minerals  elements of the periodic table. And you can't patent laws of nature    the law of gravity  E   mc . These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none. It seemed to us that DNA  the most fundamental structure of life  that codes for the production of all of our proteins  is both a product of nature and a law of nature  regardless of whether it's in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube. As we delved into this issue  we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts    scientists  medical professionals  lawyers  patent lawyers. Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy  and  at least in theory  as a matter of law. All of them thought our chances of winning a gene patent challenge were about zero. Why is that  Well  the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than    years. There were literally thousands of patents on human genes. The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo  the biotech industry had grown up around this practice  and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress  and had gone absolutely nowhere. So the bottom line  courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents. Now  neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge  and hearing   Being right just isn't enough   seemed all the more reason to take on this fight. So we set out to build our case. Now  patent cases tend to be  Company A sues Company B over some really narrow  obscure technical issue. We weren't really interested in that kind of case  and we thought this case was much bigger than that. This was about scientific freedom  medical progress  the rights of patients. So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case    more like a civil rights case. We set out to identify a gene patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation. We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics  a company that's based in Salt Lake City  Utah. Myriad held patents on two genes  the BRCA  and the BRCA  genes. Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States. It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop. It charged a lot of money for its test    over       dollars. It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community. And perhaps worst of all  for a period of several years  Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France. It has been estimated that during that period  for several years  as many as    percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer    a negative test result that should have been positive. This is Kathleen Maxian. Kathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age    and she was tested by Myriad. The test was negative. The family was relieved. That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family  and that other members of her family didn't need to be tested. But two years later  Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian cancer. It turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the    percent who received a false negative test result. Had Eileen received the proper result  Kathleen would have then been tested  and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented. Once we settled on Myriad  we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems. We ended up with    highly committed plaintiffs  genetic counselors  geneticists who had received cease and desist letters  advocacy organizations  four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than         scientists and medical professionals  and individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test  or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not  as a result of the patents. One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science. So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention  and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature  we had to explain a couple of basic concepts  like  What's a gene  What's DNA  How is DNA isolated  and why isn't that an invention  We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts  trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately. And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors  like gold. So isolating DNA    it's like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed. You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold  but you can't patent the gold itself. It might've taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain  you still can't patent it  it's still gold. And the gold  once it's extracted  can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain  you can make jewelry out of it for example    still can't patent the gold  it's still gold. So now it's       and we're ready to file our case. We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York  and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet. In March       Judge Sweet issued his opinion        pages    and a complete victory for our side. In reading the opinion  we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case. I mean  our brief    it was pretty good  but not this good. How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time  We just could not comprehend how this had happened. So it turned out  Judge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time  was not just a lawyer    he was a scientist. He was not just a scientist    he had a PhD in molecular biology. What an incredible stroke of luck  Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. And here things got really interesting. First  in a pivotal moment of this case  the US government switched sides. So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side. But now in direct opposition to its own patent office  the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion  and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible. This was a really big deal  totally unexpected. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears all patent cases  and it has a reputation for being very  very pro patent. So even with this remarkable development  we expected to lose. And we did. Sort of. Ends up split decision    to  . But the two judges who ruled against us  did so for completely different reasons. The first one  Judge Lourie  made up his own novel  biological theory    totally wrong. He decided Myriad had created a new chemical    made absolutely no sense. Myriad didn't even argue this  so it came out of the blue. The other  Judge Moore  said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature. But she's like   I don't want to shake up the biotech industry.  The third  Judge Bryson  agreed with us. So now we sought review by the Supreme Court. And when you petition the Supreme Court  you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer. Usually these questions take the form of a super long paragraph  like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses   wherein this  and  therefore that.  We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever. Four words  Are human genes patentable  Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words  I said   Well  I don't know. I think you have to say  'Is isolated DNA patentable '   Nope. I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago.  Well  I certainly couldn't argue with that. The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives  and it agreed to hear ours. The day of the oral argument arrives  and it was really  really exciting    long line of people outside  people had been standing in line since      in the morning to try to get into the courthouse. Two breast cancer organizations  Breast Cancer Action and FORCE  had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps. Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway  moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career. I was clearly more nervous than he was. But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces  our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories  the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical  patient advocacy  environmental and religious organizations  who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case. Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project  including the co discoverer of DNA himself  James Watson  who had submitted a brief to the court  where he referred to gene patenting as  lunacy.  The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake. The argument itself was riveting. Chris argued brilliantly. But for me  the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA  through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges  very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years. Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon. Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree. And in one of my absolutely favorite moments  Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be  just nature sitting there.  We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day  but I could never have anticipated the outcome  nine to zero.  A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature  and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated. And furthermore  Myriad did not create anything.  Within    hours of the decision  five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes. Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's. Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering. But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad. It ends a    year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the United States. It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation. And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail  Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need. A few weeks after the court issued its decision  I received a small package in the mail. It was from Bob Cook Deegan  a professor at Duke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case. I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal. We took a big risk in taking this case. Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing. The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish  with many twists and turns along the way. A little luck certainly helped  but it was the communities that we bridged  the alliances that we created  that made pigs fly. Thank you. This is Pleurobot. Pleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species called Pleurodeles waltl. Pleurobot can walk  as you can see here  and as you'll see later  it can also swim. So you might ask  why did we design this robot  And in fact  this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience. Indeed  we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move  and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion. But the more I work in biorobotics  the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion. If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around  or even us as humans  when you go jogging or play tennis  we do amazing things. And in fact  our nervous system solves a very  very complex control problem. It has to coordinate more or less     muscles perfectly  because if the coordination is bad  we fall over or we do bad locomotion. And my goal is to understand how this works. There are four main components behind animal locomotion. The first component is just the body  and in fact we should never underestimate to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals. Then you have the spinal cord  and in the spinal cord you find reflexes  multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity. A third component are central pattern generators. These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals that can generate  by themselves  very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity while receiving only very simple input signals. And these input signals coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain  like the motor cortex  the cerebellum  the basal ganglia  will all modulate activity of the spinal cord while we do locomotion. But what's interesting is to what extent just a low level component  the spinal cord  together with the body  already solve a big part of the locomotion problem. You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken  it can still run for a while  showing that just the lower part  spinal cord and body  already solve a big part of locomotion. Now  understanding how this works is very complex  because first of all  recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult. It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex than in the spinal cord  because it's protected by the vertebrae. Especially in humans  very hard to do. A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex and very dynamic interaction between these four components. So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time. This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models can really help. So what's biorobotics  Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals to make robots to go outdoors  like service robots or search and rescue robots or field robots. And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain    stairs  mountains  forests  places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job. The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well. There are some very nice projects where robots are used  like a scientific tool for neuroscience  for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics. And this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot. So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists like Jean Marie Cabelguen  a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France  and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots. And here we want to start simple. So it's good to start with simple animals like lampreys  which are very primitive fish  and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion  like in salamanders  but also in cats and in humans  in mammals. And here  a robot becomes an interesting tool to validate our models. And in fact  for me  Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true. Like  more or less    years ago I was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion during my PhD. But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations. Like  simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground  it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer. Why not have a real robot and real physics  So among all these animals  one of my favorites is the salamander. You might ask why  and it's because as an amphibian  it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view. It makes a wonderful link between swimming  as you find it in eels or fish  and quadruped locomotion  as you see in mammals  in cats and humans. And in fact  the modern salamander is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate  so it's almost a living fossil  which gives us access to our ancestor  the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods. So the salamander swims by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait  so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail. And if you place the salamander on the ground  it switches to what's called a walking trot gait. In this case  you have nice periodic activation of the limbs which are very nicely coordinated with this standing wave undulation of the body  and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot. Now  one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body. So if you take a decerebrated salamander    it's not so nice but you remove the head    and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord  at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking like gait. If you stimulate a bit more  the gait accelerates. And at some point  there's a threshold  and automatically  the animal switches to swimming. This is amazing. Just changing the global drive  as if you are pressing the gas pedal of descending modulation to your spinal cord  makes a complete switch between two very different gaits. And in fact  the same has been observed in cats. If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat  you can switch between walk  trot and gallop. Or in birds  you can make a bird switch between walking  at a low level of stimulation  and flapping its wings at high level stimulation. And this really shows that the spinal cord is a very sophisticated locomotion controller. So we studied salamander locomotion in more detail  and we had in fact access to a very nice X ray video machine from Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany. And thanks to that  you really have an amazing machine to record all the bone motion in great detail. That's what we did. So we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in  D. And what we did is collect a whole database of motions  both on ground and in water  to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors that a real animal can do. And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot. So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure  where to place the motors  how to connect them together  to be able to replay these motions as well as possible. And this is how Pleurobot came to life. So let's look at how close it is to the real animal. So what you see here is almost a direct comparison between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot. You can see that we have almost a one to one exact replay of the walking gait. If you go backwards and slowly  you see it even better. But even better  we can do swimming. So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot    and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits. And here  we were very happy  because this is difficult to do. The physics of interaction are complex. Our robot is much bigger than a small animal  so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies to make sure we had the same interaction physics. But you see at the end  we have a very close match  and we were very  very happy with this. So let's go to the spinal cord. So here what we did with Jean Marie Cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits. And what's interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit  which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey  this primitive eel like fish  and it looks like during evolution  new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs  to do the leg locomotion. And we know where these neural oscillators are but what we did was to make a mathematical model to see how they should be coupled to allow this transition between the two very different gaits. And we tested that on board of a robot. And this is how it looks. So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot. And the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain. And what's interesting is  by playing with these signals  we can completely control speed  heading and type of gait. For instance  when we stimulate at a low level  we have the walking gait  and at some point  if we stimulate a lot  very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait. And finally  we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other. And I think it's really beautiful how nature has distributed control to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle. It just has to worry about this high level modulation  and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles. So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics. So this is another project where we studied cat biomechanics  and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion. And we found three important criteria in the properties  basically  of the limbs. The first one is that a cat limb more or less looks like a pantograph like structure. So a pantograph is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel. So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments. A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight. Most of the muscles are in the trunk  which is a good idea  because then the limbs have low inertia and can be moved very rapidly. The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb  so to handle impacts and forces. And this is how we designed Cheetah Cub. So let's invite Cheetah Cub onstage. So this is Peter Eckert  who does his PhD on this robot  and as you see  it's a cute little robot. It looks a bit like a toy  but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat. So you see  it's very compliant  very lightweight  and also very elastic  so you can easily press it down and it will not break. It will just jump  in fact. And this very elastic property is also very important. And you also see a bit these properties of these three segments of the leg as pantograph. Now  what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait is obtained purely in open loop  meaning no sensors  no complex feedback loops. And that's interesting  because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait  and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion. To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion  as you will see in the next video  where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step  and the robot will not fall over  which was a surprise for us. This is a small perturbation. I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over  because there are no sensors  no fast feedback loop. But no  just the mechanics stabilized the gait  and the robot doesn't fall over. Obviously  if you make the step bigger  and if you have obstacles  you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything. But what's important here is that just for small perturbation  the mechanics are right. And I think this is a very important message from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience  saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion. Now  how does this relate to human locomotion  Clearly  human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion  but at the same time  the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates. And especially the spinal cord is also the key controller for locomotion in humans. That's why  if there's a lesion of the spinal cord  this has dramatic effects. The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic. This is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord. Especially  it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion. So a big goal of neuroprosthetics is to be able to reactivate that communication using electrical or chemical stimulations. And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that  especially at EPFL. My colleagues Gr goire Courtine and Silvestro Micera  with whom I collaborate. But to do this properly  it's very important to understand how the spinal cord works  how it interacts with the body  and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord. This is where the robots and models that I've presented today will hopefully play a key role towards these very important goals. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Auke  I've seen in your lab other robots that do things like swim in pollution and measure the pollution while they swim. But for this one  you mentioned in your talk  like a side project  search and rescue  and it does have a camera on its nose. Auke Ijspeert  Absolutely. So the robot    We have some spin off projects where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection  so this robot is now seeing you. And the big dream is to  if you have a difficult situation like a collapsed building or a building that is flooded  and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs  why not send in a robot that can crawl around  swim  walk  with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors and possibly create a communication link with the survivor. BG  Of course  assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this. AI  Yeah  we should probably change the appearance quite a bit  because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you. But by changing the appearance and it making it more robust  I'm sure we can make a good tool out of it. BG  Thank you very much. Thank you and your team. Melati Wijsen  Bali    island of gods. Isabel Wijsen  A green paradise. MW  Or ... a paradise lost. Bali  island of garbage. IW  In Bali  we generate     cubic meters of plastic garbage a day. That's about a    story building. And when it comes to plastic bags  less than five percent gets recycled. MW  We know that changes the image you may have of our island. It changed ours  too  when we learned about it  when we learned that almost all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains and then in our rivers and then in our ocean. And those that don't even make it to the ocean  they're either burned or littered. IW  So we decided to do something about it. And we've been working for almost three years now to try to say no to plastic bags on our home island. And we have had some significant successes. MW  We are sisters  and we go to the best school on earth  Green School  Bali. Green School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo  but also in the way that it teaches. We are taught to become leaders of today  something a normal textbook cannot match. IW  One day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people  like Nelson Mandela  Lady Diana and Mahatma Gandhi. Walking home that day  we agreed that we also wanted to be significant. Why should we wait until we were grown up to be significant  We wanted to do something now. MW  Sitting on the sofa that night  we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali. And one thing that stood out to us the most was the plastic garbage. But that is a huge problem. So we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids  plastic bags. And the idea was born. IW  We started researching  and let's just say  the more we learned  there was nothing good about plastic bags. And you know what  We don't even need them. MW  We were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags in many other places  from Hawaii to Rwanda and to severals cities like Oakland and Dublin. IW  And so the idea turned into the launch of  Bye Bye Plastic Bags.  MW  In the years that we have been campaigning  we have learned a lot. Lesson number one  you cannot do it all by yourself. You need a big team of like minded kids  and so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew. The volunteer team includes children from all over the island  from both international and local schools. And together with them  we started a multi layered approach  based on an on  and off line signature petition  educational and inspirational presentations at schools and we raise general awareness at markets  festivals  beach clean ups. And last but not least  we distribute alternative bags  bags like net bags  recycled newspaper bags or     percent organic material bags  all made by local initiatives on the island. IW  We run a pilot village  home of     families. The village mayor was our first friend and he loved our T shirts  so that helped. We focused on making the customers aware  because that's where the change needs to happen. The village is already two thirds along the way of becoming plastic bag free. Our first attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed. So we thought   Hmm ... a petition with one million signatures. They can't ignore us  right   MW  Right  IW  But  who would have guessed one million signatures is  like  a thousand times a thousand  We got stuck    till we learned lesson number two  think outside the box. Someone mentioned that the Bali airport handles    million arrivals and departures a year. MW  But how do we get into the airport  And here comes lesson number three  persistence. Off we headed to the airport. We got past the janitor. And then it was his boss's boss  and then the assistant office manager  and then the office manager  and then ... we got shuffled down two levels and thought  well  here comes the janitor again. And after several days knocking on doors and just being kids on a mission  we finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports. And we gave him the  Bali of plastic bags  speech  and being a very nice man  he said   imitating the man's voice   I cannot believe what I'm about say  but I'm going to give authorization to collect signatures behind customs and immigrations.  IW  In our first hour and a half there  we got almost       signatures. How cool is that  Lesson number four  you need champions at all levels of society  from students to commercial managers to famous people. And thanks to the attraction of Green School  we had access to a steady stream of celebrities. Ban Ki Moon taught us that Secretary Generals of the United Nations don't sign petitions    even if kids ask nicely. But he promised to spread the word  and now we work closely with the United Nations. MW  Jane Goodall taught us the power of a people's network. She started with just one Roots   Shoots group and now she has       groups around the world. We are one of them. She's a real inspiration. If you're a fellow Rotarian  nice to meet you. We're Interactors  the youngest department of Rotary International. IW  But we have also learned much about patience  MW  how to deal with frustrations  IW  leadership  MW  teamwork  IW  friendship  MW  we learned more about the Balinese and their culture IW  and we learned about the importance of commitment. MW  It's not always easy. Sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk. IW  But last year  we did exactly that. We went to India to give a talk  and our parents took us to visit the former private house of Mahatma Gandhi. We learned about the power of hunger strikes he did to reach his goals. Yes  by the end of the tour  when we met our parents again  we both made a decision and said   We're going on a hunger strike   MW  And you can probably imagine their faces. It took a lot of convincing  and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well. Isabel and I were serious about doing this. So we met with a nutritionist  and we came up with a compromise of not eating from sunrise to sunset every day until the governor of Bali would agree to meet with us to talk about how to stop plastic bags on Bali. IW  Our  mogak makan   as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia  started. We used social media to support our goal and already on day two  police started to come to our home and school. What were these two girls doing  We knew we weren't making the governor look his best by doing this food strike    we could have gone to jail. But  hey  it worked. Twenty four hours later  we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor. MW  And there he was    waiting for us to meet and speak  being all supportive and thankful for our willingness to care for the beauty and the environment of Bali. He signed a promise to help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags. And we are now friends  and on a regular basis  we remind him and his team of the promises he has made. And indeed  recently he stated and committed that Bali will be plastic bag free by     . IW  Also  at the International Airport of Bali  one of our supporters is planning to start a plastic bag free policy by     . MW  Stop handing out free plastic bags and bring in your own reusable bag is our next message to change that mindset of the public. IW  Our short term campaign   One Island   One Voice   is all about this. We check and recognize the shops and restaurants that have declared themselves a plastic bag free zone  and we put this sticker at their entrance and publish their names on social media and some important magazines on Bali. And conversely  that highlights those who do not have the sticker. MW  So  why are we actually telling you all of this  Well  partly  it is because we are proud of the results that  together with our team  we have been able to reach. But also because along the way  we have learned that kids can do things. We can make things happen. Isabel and I were only    and    years old when we started this. We never had a business plan  nor a fixed strategy  nor any hidden agendas    just the idea in front of us and a group of friends working with us. All we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home. Kids have a boundless energy and a motivation to be the change the world needs. IW  So to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world  go for it  Make that difference. We're not telling you it's going to be easy. We're telling you it's going to be worth it. Us kids may only be    percent of the world's population  but we are     percent of the future. MW  We still have a lot of work to do  but know that we still not stop until the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports will be Both   Welcome to Bali  do you have nay plastic bags to declare   Om shanti shanti shanti om. Thank you.
