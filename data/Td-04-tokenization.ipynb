While so-called stopwords, sometimes also imagined as an extended set of function words to include words too common to be of any use in distinguishing one text from another, have proven useful in many applications, we felt it was better to keep all the words in our initial processing of the corpus and only remove words in later experiments as they proved problematic -- read \"mostly harmless\" -- in a particular context."

That\\'s almost the size of Germany. Today, we\\'re nearing 7 billion people. At this rate, we\\'ll reach 9 billion people by 2040. And we all need food. But how? How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet? We already know climate change is a big problem. But it\\'s not the only problem. We need to face \\'the other inconvenient truth.\\' A global crisis in agriculture. Population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources. More than 40% of Earth\\'s land has been cleared for agriculture. Global croplands cover 16 million km². That\\'s almost the size of South America. Global pastures cover 30 million km². That\\'s the size of Africa. Agriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined. Irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet. We use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year. That\\'s enough to fill 7,305 Empire State Buildings every day. Today, many large rivers have reduced flows. Some dry up altogether. Look at the Aral Sea, now turned to desert. Or the Colorado River, which no longer flows to the ocean. Fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment. The consequence? Widespread water pollution and massive degradation of lakes and rivers. Surprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change. It generates 30% of greenhouse gas emissions. That\\'s more than the emissions from all electricity and industry, or from all the world\\'s planes, trains and automobiles. Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation, methane from animals and rice fields, and nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing. There is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture. And there\\'s nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival. Here\\'s the dilemma... As the world grows by several billion more people, We\\'ll need to double, maybe even triple, global food production. So where do we go from here? We need a bigger conversation, an international dialogue. We need to invest in real solutions: incentives for farmers, precision agriculture, new crop varieties, drip irrigation, gray water recycling, better tillage practices, smarter diets. We need everyone at the table. Advocates of commercial agriculture, environmental conservation, and organic farming... must work together. There is no single solution. We need collaboration, imagination, determination, because failure is not an option. How do we feed the world without destroying it? Yeah, so we face one of the greatest grand challenges in all of human history today: the need to feed nine billion people and do so sustainably and equitably and justly, at the same time protecting our planet for this and future generations. This is going to be one of the hardest things we ever have done in human history, and we absolutely have to get it right, and we have to get it right on our first and only try. So thanks very much.
