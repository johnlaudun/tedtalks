# About the Data

Katherine M. Kinnaird and John Laudun[1](#about-us)

The files in this folder are the data files released as part of the paper, _TED talks as Data_, submitted to the Journal of Cultural Analyics. The first of which is the exported CSV (from a Google shee) of a list of TED talks maintained by anonymous authors. The remaining files are the four collated data files.

For working files described in Section 3 of the paper, please check the `speakers_work` directory. For the associated Jupyter Notebooks, please check the `data` directory (which is the parent directory to this release directory).
