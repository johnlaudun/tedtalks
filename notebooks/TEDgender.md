## Introduction

It has been a few years since we released the TED Talks data set, and during that time a lot has happened in cultural analytics. We have seen a widening in scope of kinds of analyses and the steady increase in the kinds of data that analysts think important to engage. 

While a lot has happened, we also felt it was worthwhile to return to the TED talks data and see if we could not use it as a way to think through a number of dimensions of texts that we felt could be explored.

## Scholarship

What are we trying to do here? What does our exploration of gender within TED talks hope to accomplish?

“Cultural analytics can do more to interrogate and historicize categories like gender, as well as trace how these categories were socially constructed.” (Lavin 2020: 9)

### Getting to Words

Given the prominence of TED talks over the past two decades, a description of the nature of the talks hardly seems necessary, but since so many of us encounter TED talks as embedded in other content, it might be useful to describe the site itself, which to some degree determines the nature of the artifacts which the current study examines.

```{warning}
Ack! The site has undergone another re-design.

Most corpora with origins outside digitized text have to treat the varieties of well-established, and also fortunately ever-diminishing, artifacts and oddities born of OCR processes. TED talks are largely live performances with an oral text at their center. The TED website hosts video recordings of the performances, and the digitized text transcripts are a product not of an automated process but of crowd-sourcing. The resultant transcripts, as we describe below, are reasonably accurate and free of some of the worst oddities of machine transcription but subject to a host of variable transcription practices introduced by a myriad of humans, each with different assumptions and experiences, all contributing to a single document. One quick example might suffice to demonstrate the range of human responses to an oral performance that is being transcribed into written text: how long and in what orthographic form is an exhalation or exclamation featuring ah? As it turns out, there is not one answer, there isn’t even agreement on whether the letter h should be included. 

## Getting to Gender

We need a figure that gives total number of TED talks for each year in our corpus as talks by women + talks by men + talks by others.

See Lavin’s “interpretive groupings” (tables on 19): could this be done using a high number of topics in a topic model, like what Schmidt does in “plot arceology” and what Archer and Jockers do in The Bestseller Code?

“First-person narrators constitute a significant exception, because there are no signs of gender attached to the pronoun “I.” So first-person narrators won’t be considered in this study” (Underwood, Bamman, and Lee 2018: 3). 

Could we do something to what they, and Cheng and Lavin, have described in terms of comparing first-person discourse between male and female speakers? E.g., actions I performs, actions of which I (me) is the object, adjectives that modify I/me, or nouns that I governs (e.g., “my spirits”).

“In books written by men, women occupy on average only quarter to a third of the character-space. In books written by women, the division is much closer to equal.” >>> Can we investigate if something occurs similarly with first-person narration? Do women occupy more or less of “agent-space” within a given discourse/text vis-a-vis men?

The importance of imaginative worlds in gender discernment.
