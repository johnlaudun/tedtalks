    "In this notebook we load the complete datasets of both TED and TED+ talks. (No TEDx talks.) We use Python's `Sci-Kit Learn` library to create a term frequency matrix with an initial shape of 1747 x 50379. Summing the words to get a total for each word across all talks in the dataset, we then hand-inspect the totals and discover that there is an assortment of numbers that recur: an exploration of that phenomenon appears in a separate notebook. The primary task of this notebook is to count the words in the text, which means addressing the matter of parentheticals head on. Much of this work occurs in a separate notebook, but everything comes down to the fact that there are two kinds of parenthetical expressions in TED talks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* those which indicate actions and events outside the speaker's discourse, such as the audience laughing or applauding or the speaker sighing or playing music. \n",
    "* those which somehow the TED transcription practices have discerned as being digressive material within the speech of the author. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to remove the former and keep the latter. In the end, the decision is made to remove, through `regex` matching, the top 20 parentheticals and to leave the others, most of which occur less than a dozen times. The affect on the overall study is thus reduced significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "After removing the parentheticals, a second term matrix is derived with a total vocabulary of 50377. (This after discovering a slight bug, or at least weirdness, in `sklearn` that is now in their bug-tracking system.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in this notebook is to raise the threshold for a word to be included in the TF-matrix to 2 documents. With that done, we convert the matrix to a pandas dataframe and then save to CSV. (QUESTION: better/more efficient to save as pickle?)\n",
