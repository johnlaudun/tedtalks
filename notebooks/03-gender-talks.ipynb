    "# Gendering the talks \n",
    "\n",
    "One of our areas of interest are to see if TED talks by men and women are different. If there are differences, we would like to see if we can detect the gender of a speaker based on the words in a TED talk transcript. To pursue these avenues, we begin by \"gendering\" talks when possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use the genders of the speakers to \"gender\" the TED talks themselves. A talk with one speaker inherits the gender of the speaker. For a talk with two speakers, if the genders of the speakers are the same, then we proceed as if the talk had one speaker. For talks with two speakers where the genders of the speakers is not the same, we place these talks to the side. "
