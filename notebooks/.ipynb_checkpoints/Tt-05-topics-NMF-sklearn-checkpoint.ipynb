      "Wow  what an honor. I always wondered what this would feel like. So eight years ago  I got the worst career advice of my life. I had a friend tell me   Don't worry about how much you like the work you're doing now. It's all about just building your resume.  And I'd just come back from living in Spain for a while  and I'd joined this Fortune     company. I thought   This is fantastic. I'm going to have big impact on the world.  I had all these ideas. And within about two months  I noticed at about   am every morning I had this strange urge to want to slam my head through the monitor of my computer. I don't know if anyone's ever felt that. And I noticed pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space had already automated my job role. And this is right about when I got this sage advice to build up my resume. Well  as I'm trying to figure out what two story window I'm going to jump out of and change things up  I read some altogether different advice from Warren Buffett  and he said   Taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age.  And I heard that  and that was all I needed. Within two weeks  I was out of there  and I left with one intention  to find something that I could screw up. That's how tough it was. I wanted to have some type of impact. It didn't matter what it was. And I found pretty quickly that I wasn't alone  it turns out that over    percent of the people around don't enjoy their work. I'm guessing this room is different  but that's the average that Deloitte has done with their studies. So I wanted to find out  what is it that sets these people apart  the people who do the passionate  world changing work  that wake up inspired every day  and then these people  the other    percent who lead these lives of quiet desperation. So I started to interview all these people doing this inspiring work  and I read books and did case studies      books altogether on purpose and career and all this  totally just self immersion  really for the selfish reason of    I wanted to find the work that I couldn't not do  what that was for me. But as I was doing this  more and more people started to ask me   You're into this career thing. I don't like my job. Can we sit down for lunch   I'd say   Sure.  But I would have to warn them  because at this point  my quit rate was also    percent. Of the people I'd sit down with for lunch     percent would quit their job within two months. I was proud of this  and it wasn't that I had any special magic. It was that I would ask one simple question. It was   Why are you doing the work that you're doing   And so often their answer would be   Well  because somebody told me I'm supposed to.  And I realized that so many people around us are climbing their way up this ladder that someone tells them to climb  and it ends up being leaned up against the wrong wall  or no wall at all. The more time I spent around these people and saw this problem  I thought  what if we could create a community  a place where people could feel like they belonged and that it was OK to do things differently  to take the road less traveled  where that was encouraged  and inspire people to change  And that later became what I now call Live Your Legend  which I'll explain in a little bit. But as I've made these discoveries  I noticed a framework of really three simple things that all these different passionate world changers have in common  whether you're a Steve Jobs or if you're just  you know  the person that has the bakery down the street. But you're doing work that embodies who you are. I want to share those three with you  so we can use them as a lens for the rest of today and hopefully the rest of our life. The first part of this three step passionate work framework is becoming a self expert and understanding yourself  because if you don't know what you're looking for  you're never going to find it. And the thing is that no one is going to do this for us. There's no major in university on passion and purpose and career. I don't know how that's not a required double major  but don't even get me started on that. I mean  you spend more time picking out a dorm room TV set than you do you picking your major and your area of study. But the point is  it's on us to figure that out  and we need a framework  we need a way to navigate through this. And so the first step of our compass is finding out what our unique strengths are. What are the things that we wake up loving to do no matter what  whether we're paid or we're not paid  the things that people thank us for  And the Strengths Finder  .  is a book and also an online tool. I highly recommend it for sorting out what it is that you're naturally good at. And next  what's our framework or our hierarchy for making decisions  Do we care about the people  our family  health  or is it achievement  success  all this stuff  We have to figure out what it is to make these decisions  so we know what our soul is made of  so that we don't go selling it to some cause we don't give a shit about. And then the next step is our experiences. All of us have these experiences. We learn things every day  every minute about what we love  what we hate  what we're good at  what we're terrible at. And if we don't spend time paying attention to that and assimilating that learning and applying it to the rest of our lives  it's all for nothing. Every day  every week  every month of every year I spend some time just reflecting on what went right  what went wrong  and what do I want to repeat  what can I apply more to my life. And even more so than that  as you see people  especially today  who inspire you  who are doing things where you say  Oh God  what Jeff is doing  I want to be like him.  Why are you saying that  Open up a journal. Write down what it is about them that inspires you. It's not going to be everything about their life  but whatever it is  take note on that  so over time we'll have this repository of things that we can use to apply to our life and have a more passionate existence and make a better impact. Because when we start to put these things together  we can then define what success actually means to us  and without these different parts of the compass  it's impossible. We end up in the situation    we have that scripted life that everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere. It's kind of like in Wall Street    if anybody saw that  the peon employee asks the big Wall Street banker CEO   What's your number  Everyone's got a number  where if they make this money  they'll leave it all.  He says   Oh  it's simple. More.  And he just smiles. And it's the sad state of most of the people that haven't spent time understanding what matters for them  who keep reaching for something that doesn't mean anything to us  but we're doing it because everyone said we're supposed to. But once we have this framework together  we can start to identify the things that make us come alive. You know  before this  a passion could come and hit you in the face  or maybe in your possible line of work  you might throw it away because you don't have a way of identifying it. But once you do  you can see something that's congruent with my strengths  my values  who I am as a person  so I'm going to grab ahold of this  I'm going to do something with it  and I'm going to pursue it and try to make an impact with it. And Live Your Legend and the movement we've built wouldn't exist if I didn't have this compass to identify   Wow  this is something I want to pursue and make a difference with.  If we don't know what we're looking for  we're never going to find it  but once we have this framework  this compass  then we can move on to what's next    and that's not me up there    doing the impossible and pushing our limits. There's two reasons why people don't do things. One is they tell themselves they can't do them  or people around them tell them they can't do them. Either way  we start to believe it. Either we give up  or we never start in the first place. The things is  everyone was impossible until somebody did it. Every invention  every new thing in the world  people thought were crazy at first. Roger Bannister and the four minute mile  it was a physical impossibility to break the four minute mile in a foot race until Roger Bannister stood up and did it. And then what happened  Two months later     people broke the four minute mile. The things that we have in our head that we think are impossible are often just milestones waiting to be accomplished if we can push those limits a bit. And I think this starts with probably your physical body and fitness more than anything  because we can control that. If you don't think you can run a mile  you show yourself you can run a mile or two  or a marathon  or lose five pounds  or whatever it is  you realize that confidence compounds and can be transferred into the rest of your world. And I've actually gotten into the habit of this a little bit with my friends. We have this little group. We go on physical adventures  and recently  I found myself in a kind of precarious spot. I'm terrified of deep  dark  blue water. I don't know if anyone's ever had that same fear ever since they watched Jaws         and   like six times when I was a kid. But anything above here  if it's murky  I can already feel it right now. I swear there's something in there. Even if it's Lake Tahoe  it's fresh water  totally unfounded fear  ridiculous  but it's there. Anyway  three years ago I find myself on this tugboat right down here in the San Francisco Bay. It's a rainy  stormy  windy day  and people are getting sick on the boat  and I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit  and I'm looking out the window in pure terror thinking I'm about to swim to my death. I'm going to try to swim across the Golden Gate. And my guess is some people in this room might have done that before. I'm sitting there  and my buddy Jonathan  who had talked me into it  he comes up to me and he could see the state I was in. And he says   Scott  hey man  what's the worst that could happen  You're wearing a wetsuit. You're not going to sink. And If you can't make it  just hop on one of the    kayaks. Plus  if there's a shark attack  why are they going to pick you over the    people in the water   So thanks  that helps. He's like   But really  just have fun with this. Good luck.  And he dives in  swims off. OK. Turns out  the pep talk totally worked  and I felt this total feeling of calm  and I think it was because Jonathan was    years old. And of the    people swimming that day     of them were between the ages of nine and   . Think how you would have approached your world differently if at nine years old you found out you could swim a mile and a half in    degree water from Alcatraz to San Francisco. What would you have said yes to  What would you have not given up on  What would you have tried  As I'm finishing this swim  I get to Aquatic Park  and I'm getting out of the water and of course half the kids are already finished  so they're cheering me on and they're all excited. And I got total popsicle head  if anyone's ever swam in the Bay  and I'm trying to just thaw my face out  and I'm watching people finish. And I see this one kid  something didn't look right. And he's just flailing like this. And he's barely able to sip some air before he slams his head back down. And I notice other parents were watching too  and I swear they were thinking the same thing I was  this is why you don't let nine year olds swim from Alcatraz. This was not fatigue. All of a sudden  two parents run up and grab him  and they put him on their shoulders  and they're dragging him like this  totally limp. And then all of a sudden they walk a few more feet and they plop him down in his wheelchair. And he puts his fists up in the most insane show of victory I've ever seen. I can still feel the warmth and the energy on this guy when he made this accomplishment. I had seen him earlier that day in his wheelchair. I just had no idea he was going to swim. I mean  where is he going to be in    years  How many people told him he couldn't do that  that he would die if tried that  You prove people wrong  you prove yourself wrong  that you can make little incremental pushes of what you believe is possible. You don't have to be the fastest marathoner in the world  just your own impossibilities  to accomplish those  and it starts with little bitty steps. And the best way to do this is to surround yourself with passionate people. The fastest things to do things you don't think can be done is to surround yourself with people already doing them. There's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says.  You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.  And there is no bigger lifehack in the history of the world from getting where you are today to where you want to be than the people you choose to put in your corner. They change everything  and it's a proven fact. In       Norman Triplett did this study with a bunch of cyclists  and he would measure their times around the track in a group  and also individually. And he found that every time the cyclists in the group would cycle faster. And it's been repeated in all kinds of walks of life since then  and it proves the same thing over again  that the people around you matter  and environment is everything. But it's on you to control it  because it can go both ways. With    percent of people who don't like the work they do  that means most people around us  not in this room  but everywhere else  are encouraging complacency and keeping us from pursuing the things that matter to us so we have to manage those surroundings. I found myself in this situation    personal example  a couple years ago. Has anyone ever had a hobby or a passion they poured their heart and soul into  unbelievable amount of time  and they so badly want to call it a business  but no one's paying attention and it doesn't make a dime  OK  I was there for four years trying to build this Live Your Legend movement to help people do work that they genuinely cared about and that inspired them  and I was doing all I could  and there were only three people paying attention  and they're all right there  my mother  father and my wife  Chelsea. Thank you guys for the support. And this is how badly I wanted it  it grew at zero percent for four years  and I was about to shut it down  and right about then  I moved to San Francisco and started to meet some pretty interesting people who had these crazy lifestyles of adventure  of businesses and websites and blogs that surrounded their passions and helped people in a meaningful way. And one of my friends  now  he has a family of eight  and he supports his whole family with a blog that he writes for twice a week. They just came back from a month in Europe  all of them together. This blew my mind. How does this even exist  And I got unbelievably inspired by seeing this  and instead of shutting it down  I decided  let's take it seriously. And I did everything I could to spend my time  every waking hour possible trying to hound these guys  hanging out and having beers and workouts  whatever it was. And after four years of zero growth  within six months of hanging around these people  the community at Live Your Legend grew by    times. In another    months  it grew by     times. And today over        people from     countries use our career and connection tools on a monthly basis. And those people have made up that community of passionate folks who inspired that possibility that I dreamed of for Live Your Legend so many years back. The people change everything  and this is why    you know  you ask what was going on. Well  for four years  I knew nobody in this space  and I didn't even know it existed  that people could do this stuff  that you could have movements like this. And then I'm over here in San Francisco  and everyone around me was doing it. It became normal  so my thinking went from how could I possibly do this to how could I possibly not. And right then  when that happens  that switch goes on in your head  it ripples across your whole world. And without even trying  your standards go from here to here. You don't need to change your goals. You just need to change your surroundings. That's it  and that's why I love being around this whole group of people  why I go to every TED event I can  and watch them on my iPad on the way to work  whatever it is. Because this is the group of people that inspires possibility. We have a whole day to spend together and plenty more. To sum things up  in terms of these three pillars  they all have one thing in common more than anything else. They are     percent in our control. No one can tell you you can't learn about yourself. No one can tell you you can't push your limits and learn your own impossible and push that. No one can tell you you can't surround yourself with inspiring people or get away from the people who bring you down. You can't control a recession. You can't control getting fired or getting in a car accident. Most things are totally out of our hands. These three things are totally on us  and they can change our whole world if we decide to do something about it. And the thing is  it's starting to happen on a widespread level. I just read in Forbes  the US Government reported for the first time in a month where more people had quit their jobs than had been laid off. They thought this was an anomaly  but it's happened three months straight. In a time where people claim it's kind of a tough environment  people are giving a middle finger to this scripted life  the things that people say you're supposed to do  in exchange for things that matter to them and do the things that inspire them. And the thing is  people are waking up to this possibility  that really the only thing that limits possibility now is imagination. That's not a clich  anymore. I don't care what it is that you're into  what passion  what hobby. If you're into knitting  you can find someone who is killing it knitting  and you can learn from them. It's wild. And that's what this whole day is about  to learn from the folks speaking  and we profile these people on Live Your Legend every day  because when ordinary people are doing the extraordinary  and we can be around that  it becomes normal. And this isn't about being Gandhi or Steve Jobs  doing something crazy. It's just about doing something that matters to you  and makes an impact that only you can make. Speaking of Gandhi  he was a recovering lawyer  as I've heard the term  and he was called to a greater cause  something that mattered to him  he couldn't not do. And he has this quote that I absolutely live by.  First they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you  then you win.  Everything was impossible until somebody did it. You can either hang around the people who tell you it can't be done and tell you you're stupid for trying  or surround yourself with the people who inspire possibility  the people who are in this room. Because I see it as our responsibility to show the world that what's seen as impossible can become that new normal. And that's already starting to happen. First  do the things that inspire us  so we can inspire other people to do the things that inspire them. But we can't find that unless we know what we're looking for. We have to do our work on ourself  be intentional about that  and make those discoveries. Because I imagine a world where    percent of people love the work they do. What would that look like  What would the innovation be like  How would you treat the people around you  Things would start to change. And as we finish up  I have just one question to ask you guys  and I think it's the only question that matters. And it's what is the work you can't not do  Discover that  live it  not just for you  but for everybody around you  because that is what starts to change the world. What is the work you can't not do  Thank you guys.\n",
      "Charlie Rose  So Larry sent me an email and he basically said  we've got to make sure that  we don't seem like we're a couple of middle aged boring men. I said  I'm flattered by that    because I'm a bit older  and he has a bit more net worth than I do. Larry Page  Well  thank you. CR  So we'll have a conversation about the Internet  and we'll have a conversation Google  and we'll have a conversation about search and privacy  and also about your philosophy and a sense of how you've connected the dots and how this journey that began some time ago has such interesting prospects. Mainly we want to talk about the future. So my first question  Where is Google and where is it going  LP  Well  this is something we think about a lot  and our mission we defined a long time ago is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And people always say  is that really what you guys are still doing  And I always kind of think about that myself  and I'm not quite sure. But actually  when I think about search  it's such a deep thing for all of us  to really understand what you want  to understand the world's information  and we're still very much in the early stages of that  which is totally crazy. We've been at it for    years already  but it's not at all done. CR  When it's done  how will it be  LP  Well  I guess  in thinking about where we're going    you know  why is it not done     a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess. You know  your computer doesn't know where you are  it doesn't know what you're doing  it doesn't know what you know  and a lot we've been trying to do recently is just make your devices work  make them understand your context. Google Now  you know  knows where you are  knows what you may need. So really having computing  work and understand you and understand that information  we really haven't done that yet. It's still very  very clunky. CR  Tell me  when you look at what Google is doing  where does Deep Mind fit  LP  Yeah  so Deep Mind is a company we just acquired recently. It's in the U.K. First  let me tell you the way we got there  which was looking at search and really understanding  trying to understand everything  and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you    like  voice was really important. So what's the state of the art  on speech recognition  It's not very good. It doesn't really understand you. So we started doing machine learning research to improve that. That helped a lot. And we started just looking at things like YouTube. Can we understand YouTube  But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats  just by itself. Now  that's an important concept. And we realized there's really something here. If we can learn what cats are  that must be really important. So I think Deep Mind  what's really amazing about Deep Mind is that it can actually    they're learning things in this unsupervised way. They started with video games  and really just  maybe I can show the video  just playing video games  and learning how to do that automatically. CR  Take a look at the video games and how machines are coming to be able to do some remarkable things. LP  The amazing thing about this is this is  I mean  obviously  these are old games  but the system just sees what you see  the pixels  and it has the controls and it has the score  and it's learned to play all of these games  same program. It's learned to play all of these games with superhuman performance. We've not been able to do things like this with computers before. And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly. This is boxing  and it figures out it can sort of pin the opponent down. The computer's on the left  and it's just racking up points. So imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule  or your information needs  or things like that. We're really just at the beginning of that  and that's what I'm really excited about. CR  When you look at all that's taken place with Deep Mind and the boxing  also a part of where we're going is artificial intelligence. Where are we  when you look at that  LP  Well  I think for me  this is kind of one of the most exciting things I've seen in a long time. The guy who started this company  Demis  has a neuroscience and a computer science background. He went back to school to get his Ph.D. to study the brain. And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things. CR  But where's the level of it now  And how fast do you think we are moving  LP  Well  this is the state of the art right now  understanding cats on YouTube and things like that  improving voice recognition. We used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally  but I think for me  this example's really exciting  because it's one program that can do a lot of different things. CR  I don't know if we can do this  but we've got the image of the cat. It would be wonderful to see this. This is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with. Can we see that image  LP  Yeah. CR  There it is. Can you see the cat  Designed by machines  seen by machines. LP  That's right. So this is learned from just watching YouTube. And there's no training  no notion of a cat  but this concept of a cat is something important that you would understand  and now that the machines can kind of understand. Maybe just finishing also on the search part  it started with search  really understanding people's context and their information. I did have a video I wanted to show quickly on that that we actually found. Zack Matere  Not long ago  I planted a crop of potatoes. Then suddenly they started dying one after the other. I checked out the books and  they didn't tell me much. So  I went and I did a search.   Zack Matere  Farmer   Potato diseases. One of the websites told me that ants could be the problem. It said  sprinkle wood ash over the plants. Then after a few days the ants disappeared. I got excited about the Internet. I have this friend who really would like to expand his business. So I went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites. When I met him next  he was going to put a windmill at the local school. I felt proud because something that wasn't there before was suddenly there. I realized that not everybody can be able to access what I was able to access. I thought that I need to have an Internet that my grandmother can use. So I thought about a notice board. A simple wooden notice board. When I get information on my phone  I'm able to post the information on the notice board. So it's basically like a computer. I use the Internet to help people. I think I am searching for a better life for me and my neighbors. So many people have access to information  but there's no follow up to that. I think the follow up to that is our knowledge. When people have the knowledge  they can find solutions without having to helped out. Information is powerful  but it is how we use it that will define us. LP  Now  the amazing thing about that video  actually  was we just read about it in the news  and we found this gentlemen  and made that little clip. CR  When I talk to people about you  they say to me  people who know you well  say  Larry wants to change the world  and he believes technology can show the way. And that means access to the Internet. It has to do with languages. It also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community  and this is an example. LP  Yeah  that's right  and I think for me  I have been focusing on access more  if we're talking about the future. We recently released this Loon Project which is using balloons to do it. It sounds totally crazy. We can show the video here. Actually  two out of three people in the world don't have good Internet access now. We actually think this can really help people sort of cost efficiently. CR  It's a balloon. LP  Yeah  get access to the Internet. CR  And why does this balloon give you access to the Internet  Because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible  they didn't have to be tethered. LP  Yeah  and this is a good example of innovation. Like  we've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it  but it was just really  how do we get access points up high  cheaply  You normally have to use satellites and it takes a long time to launch them. But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up  and actually again  it's the power of the Internet  I did a search on it  and I found         years ago  someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the Earth multiple times. And I thought  why can't we do that today  And that's how this project got going. CR  But are you at the mercy of the wind  LP  Yeah  but it turns out  we did some weather simulations which probably hadn't really been done before  and if you control the altitude of the balloons  which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways  you can actually control roughly where they go  and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet. CR  Before I talk about the future and transportation  where you've been a nerd for a while  and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles  let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here earlier with Edward Snowden. It is security and privacy. You have to have been thinking about that. LP  Yeah  absolutely. I saw the picture of Sergey with Edward Snowden yesterday. Some of you may have seen it. But I think  for me  I guess  privacy and security are a really important thing. We think about it in terms of both things  and I think you can't have privacy without security  so let me just talk about security first  because you asked about Snowden and all of that  and then I'll say a little bit about privacy. I think for me  it's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us. I don't think we can have a democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government for stuff that we've never had a conversation about. And I don't mean we have to know what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried about protecting us from  but we do need to know what the parameters of it is  what kind of surveillance the government's going to do and how and why  and I think we haven't had that conversation. So I think the government's actually done itself a tremendous disservice by doing all that in secret. CR  Never coming to Google to ask for anything. LP  Not Google  but the public. I think we need to  have a debate about that  or we can't have a functioning democracy. It's just not possible. So I'm sad that Google's in the position of protecting you and our users from the government doing secret thing that nobody knows about. It doesn't make any sense. CR  Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it. LP  Yes. The privacy side  I think it's    the world is changing. You carry a phone. It knows where you are. There's so much more information about you  and that's an important thing  and it makes sense why people are asking difficult questions. We spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are. I'm a little bit    I think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice  show them what data's being collected    search history  location data. We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome  and doing that in more ways  just giving people more choice and more awareness of what's going on. I also think it's very easy. What I'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater. And I look at  on your show  actually  I kind of lost my voice  and I haven't gotten it back. I'm hoping that by talking to you I'm going to get it back. CR  If I could do anything  I would do that. LP  All right. So get out your voodoo doll and whatever you need to do. But I think  you know what  I look at that  I made that public  and I got all this information. We got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues  and I look at medical records  and I say  wouldn't it be amazing if everyone's medical records were available anonymously to research doctors  And when someone accesses your medical record  a research doctor  they could see  you could see which doctor accessed it and why  and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have. I think if we just did that  we'd save         lives this year. CR  Absolutely. Let me go    Applause  LP  So I guess I'm just very worried that with Internet privacy  we're doing the same thing we're  doing with medical records  is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater  and we're not really thinking about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways. CR  And the necessary condition that people have to have confidence that their information will not be abused. LP  Yeah  and I had this problem with my voice stuff. I was scared to share it. Sergey encouraged me to do that  and it was a great thing to do. CR  And the response has been overwhelming. LP  Yeah  and people are super positive. We got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions  which there's no data on today. So it was a really good thing. CR  So talking about the future  what is it about you and transportation systems  LP  Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated with this when I was at college in Michigan. I had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it. And it was cold and snowing. I did some research on how much it cost  and I just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems. CR  And that began the idea of an automated car. LP  Yeah  about    years ago I learned about people working on automated cars  and I became fascinated by that  and it takes a while to  get these projects going  but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that improving the world. There's    million people or more injured per year. It's the leading cause of death for people under    in the U.S. CR  So you're talking about saving lives. LP  Yeah  and also saving space and making life better. Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads  half of the area  and most cities are not far behind  actually. It's just crazy that that's what we use our space for. CR  And how soon will we be there  LP  I think we can be there very  very soon. We've driven well over         miles now totally automated. I'm super excited about getting that out quickly. CR  But it's not only you're talking about automated cars. You also have this idea for bicycles. LP  Well at Google  we got this idea that we should just provide free bikes to everyone  and that's been amazing  most of the trips. You see bikes going everywhere  and the bikes wear out. They're getting used    hours a day. CR  But you want to put them above the street  too. LP  Well I said  how do we get people using bikes more  CR  We may have a video here. LP  Yeah  let's show the video. I just got excited about this. So this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost. Anyway  it looks totally crazy  but I was actually thinking about our campus  working with the Zippies and stuff  and just trying to get a lot more bike usage  and I was thinking about  how do you cost effectively separate the bikes from traffic  And I went and searched  and this is what I found. And we're not actually working on this  that particular thing  but it gets your imagination going. CR  Let me close with this. Give me a sense of the philosophy  of your own mind. You have this idea of  Google X . You don't simply want to go in some small  measurable arena of progress. LP  Yeah  I think many of the things we just  talked about are like that  where they're really    I almost use the economic concept of additionality  which means that you're doing something that wouldn't happen unless  you were actually doing it. And I think the more you can do things like that  the bigger impact you have  and that's about doing things that people might not think are possible. And I've been amazed  the more I learn about technology  the more I realize I don't know  and that's because this technological horizon  the thing that you can see to do next  the more you learn about technology  the more you learn what's possible. You learn that the balloons are possible because there's some material that will work for them. CR  What's interesting about  you too  though  for me  is that  we have lots of people who are thinking about the future  and they are going and looking and they're coming back  but we never see the implementation. I think of somebody you knew and read about  Tesla. The principle of that for you is what  LP  Well  I think invention is not enough. If you invent something  Tesla invented electric power that we use  but he struggled to get it out to people. That had to be done by other people. It took a long time. And I think if we can actually combine both things  where we have an innovation and invention focus  plus the ability to really    a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people in a way that's positive for the world and to give people hope. You know  I'm amazed with the Loon Project just how excited people were about that  because it gave them hope for the two thirds of the world that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good. CR  Which is a second thing about corporations. You are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well. LP  Yeah. I'm really dismayed most people think companies are basically evil. They get a bad rap. And I think that's somewhat correct. Companies are doing the same incremental thing that they did    years ago or    years ago. That's not really what we need. We need  especially in technology  we need revolutionary change  not incremental change. CR  You once said  actually  as I think I've got this about right  that you might consider  rather than giving your money  if you were leaving it to some cause  just simply giving it to Elon Musk  because you had confidence that he would change the future  and that you would therefore   LP  Yeah  if you want to go Mars  he wants to go to Mars  to back up humanity  that's a worthy goal  but it's a company  and it's philanthropical. So I think we aim to do kind of similar things. And I think  you ask  we have a lot of employees at Google who have become pretty wealthy. People make a lot of money in technology. A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world. You want to make it better. Why isn't the company that you work for worthy not just of your time but your money as well  I mean  but we don't have a concept of that. That's not how we think about companies  and I think it's sad  because companies are most of our effort. They're where most of people's time is  where a lot of the money is  and so I think I'd like for us to help out more than we are. CR  When I close conversations with lots of people  I always ask this question  What state of mind  what quality of mind is it that has served you best  People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity  and other people in the media have said that. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus. What quality of mind  as I leave this audience  has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present  LP  You know  I think the most important thing    I looked at lots of companies and why I thought they don't succeed over time. We've had a more rapid turnover of companies. And I said  what did they fundamentally do wrong  What did those companies all do wrong  And usually it's just that they missed the future. And so I think  for me  I just try to focus on that and say  what is that future really going to be and how do we create it  and how do we cause our organization  to really focus on that and drive that at a really high rate  And so that's been curiosity  it's been looking at things people might not think about  working on things that no one else is working on  because that's where the additionality really is  and be willing to do that  to take that risk. Look at Android. I felt guilty about working on Android when it was starting. It was a little startup we bought. It wasn't really what we were really working on. And I felt guilty about spending time on that. That was stupid. That was the future  right  That was a good thing to be working on. CR  It is great to see you here. It's great to hear from you  and a pleasure to sit at this table with you. Thanks  Larry. LP  Thank you. CR  Larry Page.\n",
      "I had requested slides  kind of adamantly  up till the    pretty much  last few days  but was denied access to a slide projector. I actually find them a lot more emotional       and personal  and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work  unlike PowerPoint and some other programs. Now  I agree that you have to    yeah  there are certain concessions and  you know  if you use a slide projector  you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side  or up or down  but maybe that's an O.K. trade off  to trade that off for a focus. It's a thought. Just a thought. And there's something nice about slides getting stuck. And the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up  which we won't see tonight. So. With that  let's get the first slide up here. This  as many of you have probably guessed  is a recently emptied beer can in Portugal. This    I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time  and I thought    you know  fly all night  I looked up  and I thought  wow  how clean. You come into this major airport  and they simply have a B. I mean  how nice is that  Everything's gotten simpler in design  and here's this mega airport  and God  I just    I took a picture. I thought  God  that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport. Till a couple months later  I went back to the same airport    same plane  I think    and looked up  and it said C. It was only then that I realized it was simply a gate that I was coming into. I'm a big believer in the emotion of design  and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read  before they get the rest of the information  what is the emotional response they get to the product  to the story  to the painting    whatever it is. That area of design interests me the most  and I think this for me is a real clear  very simplified version of what I'm talking about. These are a couple of garage doors painted identical  situated next to each other. So  here's the first door. You know  you get the message. You know  it's pretty clear. Take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message. O.K.  which one would you park in front of  Same color  same message  same words. The only thing that's different is the expression that the individual door owner here put into the piece    and  again  which is the psycho killer here  Yet it doesn't say that  it doesn't need to say that. I would probably park in front of the other one. I'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so. It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive. But I was in Milan and saw this street sign  and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist. And this graffiti artist has come along  made this sign a little bit better  and then moved on. He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do. This is for a book by  Metropolis.  I took some photos  and this is a billboard in Florida  and either they hadn't paid their rent  or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign  and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down  so they just teared out sections of it. And I would argue that it's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention  getting you to look over that way. And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things    Stuckey's. This is from my second book. The first book is called   The End of Print   and it was done along with a film  working with William Burroughs. And  The End of Print  is now in its fifth printing. When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it  he said no  he said he didn't believe it was the end of print. And I said  well  that's fine  I just would love to have your input on this film and this book  and he finally agreed to it. And at the end of the film  he says in this great voice that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try  but not really  he says   I remember attending an exhibition called  'Photography  The End of Painting.'  And then he says   And  of course  it wasn't at all.  So  apparently when photography was perfected  there were people going around saying  that's it  you've just ruined painting. People are just going to take pictures now. And of course  that wasn't the case. So  this is from   nd Sight   a book I did on intuition. I think it's not the only ingredient in design  but possibly the most important. It's something everybody has. It's not a matter of teaching it  in fact  most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it  it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design  but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter. So it tends to get discounted. This is a quote from Albert Einstein  who says   The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery. There comes a leap in consciousness    call it intuition or what you will    and the solution just comes to you  and you don't know from where or why.  So  it's kind of like when somebody says  Who did that song  And the more you try to think about it  the further the answer gets from you  and the minute you stop thinking about it  your intuition gives you that answer  in a sense. I like this for a couple of reasons. If you've had any design courses  they would teach you you can't read this. I think you eventually can and  more importantly  I think it's true.  Don't mistake legibility for communication.  Just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates. More importantly  it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing. So  what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material  And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area. This is working with Marshall McLuhan. I stayed and worked with his wife and son  Eric  and we came up with close to     quotes from Marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times  predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising  television  media world. And so this book is called  Probes.  It's another word for quotes. And it's    a lot of them are never    have never been published before  and basically  I've interpreted the different quotes. So  this was the contents page originally. When I got done it was     pages  and then the publisher  Gingko Press  ended up cutting it down considerably  it's just under     pages now. But I decided I liked this contents page    I liked the way it looks    so I kept it. It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever  but it's a nice spread  I think  in there. So  a couple spreads from the book  here McLuhan says   The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature  they are Nature.   The invention of printing did away with anonymity  fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property   which had never been done before printing.  When new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies  anxieties of all kinds result.   While people are engaged in creating a totally different world  they always form vivid images of the preceding world.  I hate this stuff. It's hard to read.  People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe  and no possible occupation except information gathering.  That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off. So  this is a project for Nine Inch Nails. And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden  and it was done right after     . And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA that the real estate person hadn't pointed out. There was some bomb shelter built  apparently in the '  s Cuban missile crisis. And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by  and he goes   It's something to do with the sewage system.  I was  O.K.  that's fine. I finally went down there  and it was this old rusted circular thing  and two beds  and very kind of creepy and weird. And also  surprisingly  it was done in kind of a cheap metal  and it had completely rusted through  and water everywhere  and spiders. And I thought  you know  what were they thinking  You'd think maybe cement  possibly  or something. But anyway  I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD  and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape  and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So. This is an experiment  really  for a client  Quicksilver  where we were taking what was a six shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web. So  this is a six shot sequence. I've taken one shot  I cropped it a few different ways. And then the tiny line of copy says  If you want to see this entire sequence    how this whole ride was    go to the website. And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture. Got no way of tracking it  so I could be totally wrong. I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself. This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke free Environment    asked me to do these posters. They were wild posted around New York City. You can't really    well  you can't see it at all    but the second line is really the more kind of payoff  in a sense. It says   If the cigarette companies can lie  then so can we.  But       but I did. These were literally wild posted all over New York one night  and there were definitely some heads turning  you know  people smoking and   Huh   And it was purposely done to look fairly serious. It wasn't some  you know  weird grunge type or something  it looked like they might be real. Anyway. Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts  a school in Florida. This amazes me. This is a product I just found out. I was in the Caribbean at Christmas  and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell    not that they will sell    that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin. This was either an old product with new packaging  or a brand new package  and I just thought  Yikes  How's that still happening  I do a lot of workshops all over the world  really  and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors. I felt this was one of the more successful solutions. The students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night  and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ... I did some work for Microsoft a few years back. It was a worldwide branding campaign. And it was interesting to me    my background is in sociology  I had no design training  and sometimes people say  well  that explains it    but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that I had to sell  it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve. They thought some people didn't like them. I found out that's very true  working on this campaign worldwide. And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit  and what I did was add type and people to the ad  which the previous campaign had not had  and nobody remembered them  and nobody referenced them. And we were trying to say that  hey  some of these guys that work there are actually OK  some of them actually have friends and family  and they're not all awful people. And the umbrella campaign was  Thank God it's Monday.  So  we tried to take this    what was perceived as a negative  their over competitiveness  their  you know  long working hours    and turn it into a positive and not run from it. You know  Thank God it's Monday    I get to go back to that little cubicle  those fake gray walls  and hear everybody else's conversations f or    hours and then go home. But anyway  this is one of the ads I was most pleased with  because they were all elaborately art directed  and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer. It says   Wonder Around.  And then it's a piece of the software. And this is how the ad ran around the world. In Germany  they made one small change without checking with me    nor did they have to  because it was done through agencies    but see if you can tell the difference. This is how the ad ran throughout the world  Germany made one slight change in the ad. Now  there's kind of two issues here. If you're going to put a kid in the ad  pick one that looks alive. I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week  you know. He's just really hoping that boots up and  you know ... And then as the agency explained to me  they said   Look  we don't have little green people in our country  why would we put little green people in our ads  for instance   So  I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it  I think it's a very small minded approach  the world is certainly much more global  and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer  though we'll never know. This is some work from Ray Gun. And the point of this magazine was to read the articles  listen to the music  and try to interpret it. There's no grid  there's no system  there's nothing set up in advance. This is an opener for Brian Eno  and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music. This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school. There's a lot of great writing in  Ray Gun.  And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books. Article on Bryan Ferry    just really boring article    so I set the whole article in Dingbat. You could    you could highlight it  you could make it Helvetica or something  it is the actual article. I suppose you could eventually decode it  but it's really not very well written  it really wouldn't be worthwhile. Having done a lot of magazines  I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories  and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle     . And I was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times  which was basically the moment of impact. And People magazine  I thought  got probably the best shot. It's kind of horsey type  but the texture    the second plane not quite hitting  there was something more enticing  if that's the right    it's not the right word    but in this cover than Time or Newsweek. But when I got into this magazine  there's something kind of disturbing  and this continued. On the left we see people dying  we see people running for their lives. And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast. The coveted right hand page was not given up to the whole issue. Look at the image of this lady    who knows what she's going through     and the copy says   He knows just how to give me goosebumps.  Yeah  he jumps out of buildings. It's    unfortunately  this one works  kind of  as a spread. And this continued through the entire magazine. It did not let up. This says   One clean fits all.  . There were a lot of orphans made this day  and here's a dead body being brought out. It just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate. And this one I think is possibly the worst  two ladies  both facing the same way  both wearing jeans. One    who knows what she's going through  the other one is worried about model behavior and milk. And    I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this  and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that    they actually emailed me    and they said that they appreciated the talk  and when they got back to their car  they found a note on their car that made them think maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event    it had been a few months. This was what they found on their car. There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car  but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back. This is my desktop. Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders  but I don't know what they are. These are my notes for the talk    there might be a correlation here. We are wrapping up. This I saw on the plane  flying in  for hot new products. I'm not sure this is an improvement  or a good idea  because  like  if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer  you can now get a plate in the keyboard  so there's no more faking it    that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway. Now there's a plate  and it would be really  really convenient to get a piece of pizza  then type a little bit  then ... I'm just not sure this is improvement. If you ever doubt the power of graphic design  this is a very generic sign that literally says   Vote for Hitler.  It says nothing else. And this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion  of graphic design  even though  in fact  was a very generic poster at the time. What's next  What's next is going to be people. As we get more technically driven  the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before. You have to utilize who you are in your work. Nobody else can do that  nobody else can pull from your background  from your parents  your upbringing  your whole life experience. If you allow that to happen  it's really the only way you can do some unique work  and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well. This is    I like found art  hand lettering's coming back in a big way  and I thought this was a great example of both. This lady's advertising for her lost pit bull. It's friendly    she's underlined friendly    that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell. But more importantly  she's willing to give you    bucks to go find this lost pit bull. And I'm thinking  yeah  right  I'll go look for a lost pit bill for    bucks. I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles  and you get charged by this thing and you go  oh  please be Hercles  please be the friendly one. I'm sure she never found the dog  because I took the sign. But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back. And the theme was courage  and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer. And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father  who was a test pilot  and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot  they told you that there was a    to    percent chance of death on the job. That's pretty high for most occupations. But  you know  the government would make a plane  they'd say  go see if that one flies  would you  Some of them did  some of them didn't. And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make between  like  serif versus san serif. And for the most part  they're not real life threatening. Why not experiment  Why not have some fun  Why not put some of yourself into the work  And when I was teaching  I used to always ask the students  What's the definition of a good job  And as teachers  after you get all the answers  you like to give them the correct answer. And the best one I've heard    I'm sure some of you have heard this    the definition of a good job is  If you could afford to    if money wasn't an issue    would you be doing that same work  And if you would  you've got a great job. And if you wouldn't  what the heck are you doing  You're going to be dead a really long time. Thank you very much.\n",
      "On Mondays and Thursdays  I learn how to die. I call them my terminal days. My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term  but a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer and my parents and grandparents had it. And I kept thinking  one day I could be sitting in front of a doctor who looks at my exams and says   Ricardo  things don't look very good. You have six months or a year to live.  And you start thinking about what you would do with this time. And you say   I'm going to spend  more time with the kids. I'm going to visit these places  I'm going to go up and down mountains and places and I'm going to do all the things I didn't do when I had the time.  But of course  we all know these are very bittersweet memories  we're going to have. It's very difficult to do. You spend a good part of the time crying  probably. So I said  I'm going to do something else. Every Monday and Thursday  I'm going use my terminal days. And I will do  during those days  whatever it is I was going to do if I had received that piece of news. When you think about    when you think about the opposite of work  we  many times  think it's leisure. And you say  ah  I need  some leisure time  and so forth. But the fact is that  leisure is a very busy thing. You go play golf and tennis  and you meet people  and you're going for lunch  and you're late for the movies. It's a very crowded thing that we do. The opposite of work is idleness. But very few of us know what to do with idleness. When you look at the way that we distribute our lives in general  you realize that in the periods in which we have a lot of money  we have very little time. And then when we finally have time  we have neither the money nor the health. So we started thinking about that as a company for the last    years. This is a complicated company with thousands of employees  hundreds of millions of dollars of business that makes rocket fuel propellent systems  runs       ATMs in Brazil  does income tax preparation for dozens of thousands. So this is not a simple business. We looked at it and we said  let's devolve to these people  let's give these people a company where we take away all the boarding school aspects of  this is when you arrive  this is how you dress  this is how you go to meetings  this is what you say  this is what you don't say  and let's see what's left. So we started this about    years ago  and we started dealing with this very issue. And so we said  look  the retirement  the whole issue of how  we distribute our graph of life. Instead of going mountain climbing when you're     why don't you do it next week  And we'll do it like this  we'll sell you back your Wednesdays for    percent of your salary. So now  if you were going to be  a violinist  which you probably weren't  you go and do this on Wednesday. And what we found    we thought  these are the older people who are going to be really interested in this program. And the average age of the first people who adhered were     of course. And so we started looking  and we said  we have to do things in a different way. So we started saying things like  why do we want to know what time you came to work  what time you left  etc.  Can't we exchange this for a contract for buying something from you  some kind of work  Why are we building these headquarters  Is it not an ego issue that we want to look solid and big and important  But we're dragging you two hours across town because of it  So we started asking questions one by one. We'd say it like this  One  How do we find people  We'd go out and try and recruit people and we'd say  look  when you come to us  we're not going to have two or three interviews and then you're going to be married to us for life. That's not how we do  the rest of our lives. So  come have your interviews. Anyone who's interested in interviewing  you will show up. And then we'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that  instead of just filling out the little  items of whether you're the right person. And then  come back. Spend an afternoon  spend a whole day  talk to anybody you want. Make sure we are the bride  you thought we were and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads. Slowly we went to a process  where we'd say things like  we don't want anyone to be a leader in the company if they haven't been  interviewed and approved by their future subordinates. Every six months  everyone gets  evaluated  anonymously  as a leader. And this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position  which is many times situational  as you know. And so if they don't have        percent  of a grade  they don't stay  which is probably the reason why I haven't been CEO for more than    years. And over time  we started asking other questions. We said things like  why can't people set their own salaries  What do they need to know  There's only three things  you need to know  how much people make inside the company  how much people make somewhere else in a similar business and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it. So let's give people these three pieces of information. So we started having  in the cafeteria  a computer where you could go in  and you could ask what someone spent   how much someone makes  what they make in benefits   what the company makes  what the margins are  and so forth. And this is    years ago. As this information started  coming to people  we said things like  we don't want  to see your expense report  we don't want to know how many  holidays you're taking  we don't want to know where you work. We had  at one point     different offices around town  and we'd say  go to the one  that's closest to your house  to the customer that  you're going to visit today. Don't tell us where you are. And more  even when we had thousands of people        people  we had two people in the H.R. department  and thankfully one of them has retired. And so  the question we were asking was  how can we be taking care of people  People are the only thing we have. We can't have a department that runs after people and looks after people. So as we started finding that this worked  and we'd say  we're looking for    and this is  I think  the main thing I was looking for in the terminal days and in the company  which is  how do you set up for wisdom  We've come from an age of revolution  industrial revolution  an age of information  an age of knowledge  but we're not any closer to the age of wisdom. How we design  how do we organize  for more wisdom  So for example  many times  what's the smartest or the intelligent decision doesn't jive. So we'd say things like  let's agree that you're going to sell    widgets per week. If you sell them by Wednesday   please go to the beach. Don't create a problem for us   for manufacturing  for application  then we have to buy new companies  we have to buy our competitors  we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets. So go to the beach and start again on Monday. So the process is looking for wisdom. And in the process  of course   we wanted people to know everything  and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things. So our board had two seats open  with the same voting rights  for the first two people who showed up. And so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board meeting  which had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties. And the fact is that they kept us honest. This process  as we started looking at the people who came to us  we'd say  now wait a second  people come to us and they say  where am I supposed to sit  How am I supposed to work  Where am I going to be in   years' time  And we looked at that and we said  we have to start much earlier. Where do we start  We said  oh  kindergarten  seems like a good place. So we set up a foundation  which now has   for    years  three schools  where we started asking the same questions  how do you redesign school for wisdom  It is one thing to say  we need to recycle the teachers  we need the directors to do more. But the fact is that what we do with education is entirely obsolete. The teacher's role is entirely obsolete. Going from a math class  to biology  to   th century France is very silly. So we started thinking   what could it look like  And we put together people   including people who like education  people like Paulo Freire   and two ministers of education in Brazil and we said  if we were to design a school from scratch  what would it look like  And so we created this school  which is called Lumiar  and Lumiar  one of them is a public school  and Lumiar says the following  Let's divide this role of the teacher into two. One guy  we'll call a tutor. A tutor  in the old sense of the Greek  paideia   Look after the kid. What's happening at home  what's their moment in life  etc.. But please don't teach  because the little you know compared  to Google  we don't want to know. Keep that to yourself. Now  we'll bring in people who have two things  passion and expertise  and it could be their profession or not. And we use the senior citizens  who are    percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore. So we bring them to school and we say  teach these kids whatever you really believe in. So we have violinists teaching math. We have all kinds of things where we say  don't worry about  the course material anymore. We have approximately    great threads that go from   to   . Things like  how do we measure ourselves as humans  So there's a place for math and physics and all that there. How do we express ourselves  So there's a place for music and literature  etc.  but also for grammar. And then we have things that everyone has forgotten  which are probably the most  important things in life. The very important things in life  we know nothing about. We know nothing about love  we know nothing about death  we know nothing about why we're here. So we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know. So that's a big part of what we do. So over the years  we started going into other things. We'd say  why do we have to scold the kids and say  sit down and come here  and do that  and so forth. We said  let's get the kids to do  something we call a circle  which meets once a week. And we'd say  you put the rules together and then you decide what you want to do with it. So can you all hit yourself on the head  Sure  for a week  try. They came up with the very same rules that we had  except they're theirs. And then  they have the power  which means  they can and do suspend and expel kids so that we're not playing school  they really decide. And then  in this same vein  we keep a digital mosaic  because this is not constructivist or Montessori or something. It's something where we keep the Brazilian curriculum with     tiles of a mosaic  which we want to expose these kids to by the time they're   . And follow this all the time and we know how they're doing and we say  you're not interested  in this now  let's wait a year. And the kids are in groups that don't have an age category  so the six year old kid who is ready for that with an    year old  that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups and this stuff that we have  in the schools  in general. And they have a zero  to     percent grading  which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours. Until we know they're    percent of the way we'd like them to be on this issue  so that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it. And so the courses are World Cup Soccer  or building a bicycle. And people will sign up for  a    day course on building a bicycle. Now  try to build a bicycle without  knowing that pi is  .    . You can't. And try  any one of you   using  .     for something. You don't know anymore. So this is lost and that's what  we try to do there  which is looking  for wisdom in that school. And that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life. I accumulated a lot of money  when I think about it. When you think and you say  now is the time to give back    well  if you're giving back   you took too much. I keep thinking of Warren Buffet waking up one day and finding out he has    billion dollars more than he thought he had. And he looks and he says  what am I going to do with this  And he says  I'll give it to someone who really needs this. I'll give it to Bill Gates.  Laughter  And my guy  who's my financial advisor in New York  he says  look  you're a silly guy because you would have  .  times  more money today if you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go. But I like sharing as you go better. I taught MBAs at MIT for a time and I ended up  one day  at the Mount Auburn Cemetery. It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge. And I was walking around. It was my birthday and I was thinking. And the first time around   I saw these tombstones and these wonderful people  who'd done great things and I thought  what do I want  to be remembered for  And I did another stroll around  and the second time  another question came to me  which did me better  which was  why do I want to be remembered at all  And that  I think   took me different places. When I was     my wife Fernanda and I sat for a whole afternoon  we had a big pit with fire  and I threw everything I had ever  done into that fire. This is a book in    languages  hundreds and hundreds of articles and DVDs  everything there was. And that did two things. One  it freed our five kids from following in our steps  our shadow    They don't know what I do. Which is good. And I'm not going to take them somewhere and say  one day  all of this will be yours. The five kids know nothing  which is good. And the second thing is  I freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever. I'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch in part of those terminal days. And some people would say  oh  so now you have this time  these terminal days  and so you go out and do everything. No  we've been to the beaches  so we've been to Samoa and Maldives and Mozambique  so that's done. I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas. I've gone down    meters to see  hammerhead sharks. I've spent    days on the back of a camel from Chad to Timbuktu. I've gone to the magnetic  North Pole on a dog sled. So  we've been busy. It's what I'd like to call  my empty bucket list. And with this rationale  I look at these days and I think  I'm not retired.  I don't feel retired at all. And so I'm writing a new book. We started three new companies in the last two years. I'm now working on getting this  school system for free out into the world  and I've found  very interestingly enough  that nobody wants it for free. And so I've been trying for    years to get the public system to take over this school rationale  much as the public schools we have  which has instead of    out of      as their rating  as their grades  has    out of    . But for free  nobody wants it. So maybe we'll start charging for it  and then it will go somewhere. But getting this out is one of the things we want to do. And I think what this leaves us as a message for all of you  I think is a little bit like this  We've all learned how to go on Sunday night to email and work from home. But very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon. And if we're looking for wisdom  we need to learn to do that as well. And so  what we've done all of these years is very simple  is use the little tool  which is ask three whys in a row. Because the first why you always have a good answer for. The second why  it starts getting difficult. By the third why  you don't really know why you're doing what you're doing. What I want to leave you with is the seed and the thought that maybe if you do this  you will come to the question  what for  What am I doing this for  And hopefully  as a result of that  and over time  I hope that with this  and that's what I'm wishing you  you'll have a much wiser future. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So Ricardo   you're kind of crazy. To many people  this seems crazy. And yet so deeply wise  also. The pieces I'm trying to put together are this  Your ideas are so radical. How  in business  for example  these ideas have been out for a while  probably the percentage of businesses  that have taken some of them is still quite low. Are there any times you've seen  some big company take on one of your ideas  and you've gone   Yes    Ricardo Semler  It happens. It happened about two weeks ago with Richard Branson  with his people saying  oh  I don't want to control your holidays anymore  or Netflix does a little bit of this and that  but I don't think it's very important. I'd like to see it happen maybe a little bit in a bit of a missionary zeal  but that's a very personal one. But the fact is that it takes a leap  of faith about losing control. And almost nobody who is in control is ready to take leaps of faith. It will have to come from kids  and other people who are starting companies  in a different way. CA  So that's the key thing  From your point of view the evidence is there  in the business point of view this works  but people just don't have the courage to     Whoosh  RS  They don't even have the incentive. You're running a company with a    day mandate. It's a quarterly report. If you're not good in    days  you're out. So you say   Here's a great program that  in less than one generation     And the guy says   Get out of here.  So this is the problem. CA  What you're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound. Everyone is bothered about their country's education system. No one thinks that we've caught up yet to a world where there's Google and all these  technological options. So you've got actual evidence now that  the kids so far going through your system  there's a dramatic increase  in performance. How do we help you move these ideas forward  RS  I think it's that problem of ideas whose time has come. And I've never been very evangelical about these things. We put it out there. Suddenly  you find people    there's a group in Japan   which scares me very much  which is called the Semlerists  and they have     companies. They've invited me. I've always been scared to go. And there is a group in Holland that has     small  Dutch companies. It's something that will flourish on its own. Part of it will be wrong   and it doesn't matter. This will find its own place. And I'm afraid of the other one  which says  this is so good you've got to do this. Let's set up a system  and put lots of money into it and then people will do it no matter what. CA  So you have asked  extraordinary questions your whole life. It seems to me that's the fuel  that's driven a lot of this. Do you have any other questions for us  for TED  for this group here  RS  I always come back  to variations of the question that my son asked me when he was three. We were sitting in a jacuzzi  and he said   Dad  why do we exist   There is no other question. Nobody has any other question. We have variations of this one question  from three onwards. So when you spend time in a company  in a bureaucracy  in an organization and you're saying  boy    how many people do you know who on their death beds said  boy  I wish I had spent more time at the office  So there's a whole thing  of having the courage now    not in a week  not in two months  not when you find out  you have something    to say  no  what am I doing this for  Stop everything. Let me do something else. And it will be okay  it will be much better than what you're doing  if you're stuck in a process. CA  So that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end this penultimate day of TED. Ricardo Semler  thank you so much. RS  Thank you so much.\n",
      "I'm a lifelong traveler. Even as a little kid  I was actually working out that it would be cheaper to go to boarding school in England than just to the best school down the road from my parents' house in California. So  from the time I was nine years old I was flying alone several times a year over the North Pole  just to go to school. And of course the more I flew the more I came to love to fly  so the very week after I graduated from high school  I got a job mopping tables so that I could spend every season of my   th year on a different continent. And then  almost inevitably  I became a travel writer so my job and my joy could become one. And I really began to feel that if you were lucky enough to walk around the candlelit temples of Tibet or to wander along the seafronts in Havana with music passing all around you  you could bring those sounds  and the high cobalt skies and the flash of the blue ocean back to your friends at home  and really bring some magic and clarity to your own life. Except  as you all know  one of the first things you learn when you travel is that nowhere is magical unless you can bring the right eyes to it. You take an angry man to the Himalayas  he just starts complaining about the food. And I found that the best way that I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes was  oddly  by going nowhere  just by sitting still. And of course sitting still is how many of us get what we most crave and need in our accelerated lives  a break. But it was also the only way that I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience and make sense of the future and the past. And so  to my great surprise  I found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to Tibet or to Cuba. And by going nowhere  I mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season  or even  as some people do  a few years out of a life in order to sit still long enough to find out what moves you most  to recall where your truest happiness lies and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life point in opposite directions. And of course  this is what wise beings through the centuries from every tradition have been telling us. It's an old idea. More than       years ago   the Stoics were reminding us it's not our experience that makes our lives  it's what we do with it. Imagine a hurricane suddenly  sweeps through your town and reduces every last thing to rubble. One man is traumatized for life. But another  maybe even his brother  almost feels liberated  and decides this is a great chance to start his life anew. It's exactly the same event  but radically different responses. There is nothing either good or bad  as Shakespeare told us in  Hamlet   but thinking makes it so. And this has certainly been my experience as a traveler. Twenty four years ago I took  the most mind bending trip across North Korea. But the trip lasted a few days. What I've done with it sitting still  going back to it in my head  trying to understand it  finding a place for it in my thinking  that's lasted    years already and will probably last a lifetime. The trip  in other words  gave me some amazing sights  but it's only sitting still that allows me to turn those into lasting insights. And I sometimes think that so much of our life takes place inside our heads  in memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation  that if I really want to change my life I might best begin by changing my mind. Again  none of this is new  that's why Shakespeare and the Stoics were telling us this centuries ago  but Shakespeare never had to face     emails in a day. The Stoics  as far as I know  were not on Facebook. We all know that in our on demand lives  one of the things that's most on demand is ourselves. Wherever we are  any time of night or day  our bosses  junk mailers  our parents can get to us. Sociologists have actually found that in recent years Americans are working fewer hours than    years ago  but we feel as if we're working more. We have more and more time saving devices  but sometimes  it seems  less and less time. We can more and more easily  make contact with people on the furthest corners of the planet  but sometimes in that process we lose contact with ourselves. And one of my biggest surprises  as a traveler has been to find that often it's exactly the people who have most enabled us to get anywhere who are intent on going nowhere. In other words  precisely those beings who have created the technologies that override so many of the limits of old  are the ones wisest about the need for limits  even when it comes to technology. I once went to the Google headquarters and I saw all the things many of you have heard about  the indoor tree houses  the trampolines  workers at that time enjoying    percent of their paid time free so that they could just let their imaginations go wandering. But what impressed me even more was that as I was waiting for my digital I.D.  one Googler was telling me about the program that he was about to start to teach the many  many Googlers who practice yoga to become trainers in it  and the other Googler was telling me about the book that he was about to write on the inner search engine  and the ways in which science has empirically shown that sitting still  or meditation  can lead not just to better  health or to clearer thinking  but even to emotional intelligence. I have another friend in Silicon Valley who is really one  of the most eloquent spokesmen for the latest technologies  and in fact was one of the founders of Wired magazine  Kevin Kelly. And Kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies without a smartphone or a laptop or a TV in his home. And like many in Silicon Valley  he tries really hard to observe what they call an Internet sabbath  whereby for    or    hours every week they go completely offline in order to gather the sense of direction and proportion they'll need  when they go online again. The one thing perhaps that technology hasn't always given us is a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology. And when you speak of the sabbath  look at the Ten Commandments    there's only one word there for which the adjective  holy  is used  and that's the Sabbath. I pick up the Jewish holy book of the Torah    its longest chapter  it's on the Sabbath. And we all know that it's really one of our greatest luxuries  the empty space. In many a piece of music   it's the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape. And I know I as a writer will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences and so that her imagination has room to breathe. Now  in the physical domain   of course  many people  if they have the resources  will try to get a place in the country  a second home. I've never begun to have those resources  but I sometimes remember that any time I want  I can get a second home in time  if not in space  just by taking a day off. And it's never easy because  of course   whenever I do I spend much of it worried about all the extra stuff that's going to crash down on me the following day. I sometimes think I'd rather give up meat or sex or wine than the chance to check on my emails. And every season I do try to take three days off on retreat but a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind and to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails from my bosses and maybe to be missing a friend's birthday party. But as soon as I get to a place of real quiet  I realize that it's only by going there that I'll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends. Otherwise  really  I'm just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness  which is no blessing at all. And so when I was     I decided to remake my entire life in the light of going nowhere. One evening I was coming back from the office  it was after midnight  I was in a taxi driving through Times Square  and I suddenly realized that I was racing around so much I could never catch up with my life. And my life then  as it happened  was pretty much the one I might have dreamed of as a little boy. I had really interesting friends and colleagues  I had a nice apartment on Park Avenue and   th Street. I had  to me  a fascinating job  writing about world affairs  but I could never separate myself enough from them to hear myself think    or really  to understand if I was truly happy. And so  I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto  Japan  which was the place that had long exerted a strong  really mysterious gravitational pull on me. Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it  I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it. But it's also  as you all know  a beautiful city encircled by hills  filled with more than       temples and shrines  where people have been sitting still for     years or more. And quite soon after I moved there  I ended up where I still am with my wife  formerly our kids  in a two room apartment in the middle of nowhere where we have no bicycle  no car  no TV I can understand  and I still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist  so clearly this is not ideal for job advancement or for cultural excitement or for social diversion. But I realized that it gives me what I prize most  which is days and hours. I have never once had to use a cell phone there. I almost never have to look at the time  and every morning when I wake up  really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow. And when life throws up one of its nasty surprises  as it will  more than once  when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression  or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway  I know  in my bones  that it's the time I've spent going nowhere that is going to sustain me much more than all the time I've spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island. I'll always be a traveler    my livelihood depends on it    but one of the beauties of travel is that it allows you to bring stillness into the motion and the commotion of the world. I once got on a plane in Frankfurt  Germany  and a young German woman  came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly conversation for about    minutes  and then she just turned around and sat still for    hours. She didn't once turn on her video monitor  she never pulled out a book  she didn't even go to sleep  she just sat still  and something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me. I've noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days to try to open up a space inside their lives. Some people go to black hole resorts where they'll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop to the front desk on arrival. Some people I know  just before they go to sleep  instead of scrolling through their messages or checking out YouTube  just turn out the lights and listen to some music  and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refreshed. I was once fortunate enough to drive into the high  dark mountains behind Los Angeles  where the great poet and singer and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen was living and working for many years as a full time monk in the Mount Baldy Zen Center. And I wasn't entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of     to which he gave the deliberately  unsexy title of  Old Ideas   went to number one in the charts  in    nations in the world  hit the top five in nine others. Something in us  I think  is crying out for the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that. who take the time and trouble to sit still. And I think many of us have the sensation  I certainly do  that we're standing about two inches away from a huge screen  and it's noisy and it's crowded and it's changing with every second  and that screen is our lives. And it's only by stepping back  and then further back  and holding still  that we can begin to see what the canvas means and to catch the larger picture. And a few people do that for us by going nowhere. So  in an age of acceleration  nothing can be more exhilarating than going slow. And in an age of distraction  nothing is so luxurious as paying attention. And in an age of constant movement  nothing is so urgent as sitting still. So you can go on your next vacation to Paris or Hawaii  or New Orleans  I bet you'll have a wonderful time. But  if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope  in love with the world  I think you might want to try considering going nowhere. Thank you.\n",

      "Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth. They've been here for billions of years  and what they are are single celled microscopic organisms. So they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of DNA. They have very few genes  and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out. And the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment  they grow to twice their size  they cut themselves down in the middle  and one cell becomes two  and so on and so on. They just grow and divide  and grow and divide    so a kind of boring life  except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters. I know you guys think of yourself as humans  and this is sort of how I think of you. This man is supposed to represent a generic human being  and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body. There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do  but you have    trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life. So     times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being. And of course it's the DNA that counts  so here's all the A  T  Gs and Cs that make up your genetic code  and give you all your charming characteristics. You have about        genes. Well it turns out you have     times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life. At the best  you're    percent human  but more likely about one percent human  depending on which of these metrics you like. I know you think of yourself as human beings  but I think of you as    or    percent bacterial. These bacteria are not passive riders  these are incredibly important  they keep us alive. They cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy. They digest our food  they make our vitamins  they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out. So they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive  and they never get any press for that. But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well. So  there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time  and if they are  they make you incredibly sick. And so  the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do  or all the bad things that bacteria do. The question we had is how could they do anything at all  I mean they're incredibly small  you have to have a microscope to see one. They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide  and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms. And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals. And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live. The clue to this came from another marine bacterium  and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri. What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium  a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean  named Vibrio fischeri. This bacterium has the special property that it makes light  so it makes bioluminescence  like fireflies make light. We're not doing anything to the cells here. We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room  and this is what we see. What was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light  but when the bacteria made light. What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone  so when they were in dilute suspension  they made no light. But when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously. The question that we had is how can bacteria  these primitive organisms  tell the difference from times when they're alone  and times when they're in a community  and then all do something together. What we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other  and they talk with a chemical language. This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell. When it's alone it doesn't make any light. But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones  and these are the red triangles  and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light. But when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules  the molecule    the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number. And when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are  they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony. That's how bioluminescence works    they're talking with these chemical words. The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology. Again  another plug for the animals in the ocean  Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid. What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid  and it's been turned on its back  and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells  they live in there  at high cell number that molecule is there  and they're making light. The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light. The way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii  just in sort of shallow knee deep water. The squid is nocturnal  so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps  but then at night it has to come out to hunt. On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in  since it's just in those couple feet of water. What the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria. Then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back. And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom    which is made by the bacterium    exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back  so the squid doesn't make a shadow. It actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device so predators can't see its shadow  calculate its trajectory  and eat it. This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean. But then if you think about it  the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying  thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that. And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep  it buries itself in the sand  and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm  and when the sun comes up it pumps out like    percent of the bacteria. Now the bacteria are dilute  that little hormone molecule is gone  so they're not making light    but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand. And as the day goes by the bacteria double  they release the molecule  and then light comes on at night  exactly when the squid wants it. First we figured out how this bacterium does this  but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism. And what we found    so this is now supposed to be  again  my bacterial cell    is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein    that's the red box    it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule  the red triangle. And then as the cells grow  they're all releasing that molecule into the environment  so there's lots of molecule there. And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule. These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells. When the molecule increases to a certain amount    which says something about the number of cells    it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light. Why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous  glow in the dark bacterium that lives in the ocean    all bacteria have systems like this. So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other. They make chemical words  they recognize those words  and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison. We have a fancy name for this  we call it quorum sensing. They vote with these chemical votes  the vote gets counted  and then everybody responds to the vote. What's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions. But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence. It's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins    you're enormous  that would have no effect on you. You're huge. What they do  we now understand  is they get in you  they wait  they start growing  they count themselves with these little molecules  and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together  they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host. Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing. That's how it works. We also then went to look at what are these molecules    these were the red triangles on my slides before. This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule. This is the word that it talks with. So then we started to look at other bacteria  and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered. What I hope you can see is that the molecules are related. The left hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria. But the right hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species. What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages. Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other. So these are private  secret conversations. These conversations are for intraspecies communication. Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings. Once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors. But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves  they live in incredible mixtures  with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria. And that's depicted on this slide. This is your skin. So this is just a picture    a micrograph of your skin. Anywhere on your body  it looks pretty much like this  and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there. And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria  and it's about counting your neighbors  it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species. There has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population. So we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria  and what we've found now is that in fact  bacteria are multilingual. They all have a species specific system    they have a molecule that says  me.  But then  running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered  that's generic. So  they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor  and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria. It's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication. What happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you. They take that information inside  and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population. Then again we turn to chemistry  and we figured out what this generic molecule is    that was the pink ovals on my last slide  this is it. It's a very small  five carbon molecule. What the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule. So they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication. This is the bacterial Esperanto. Once we got that far  we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language. But what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well. I've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors  they communicate with these molecules. Of course  I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing. We thought  what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear  Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics  Of course  you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics. Bacteria are incredibly multi drug resistant right now  and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria. They either pop the bacterial membrane  they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA. We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants. And so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases. We thought  well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications  just make these bacteria so they can't talk  they can't count  and they don't know to launch virulence. And so that's exactly what we've done  and we've sort of taken two strategies. The first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system. So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules    which you saw    but they're a little bit different. And so they lock into those receptors  and they jam recognition of the real thing. By targeting the red system  what we are able to do is to make species specific  or disease specific  anti quorum sensing molecules. We've also done the same thing with the pink system. We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made antagonists of the interspecies communication system. The hope is that these will be used as broad spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria. To finish I'll just show you the strategy. In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule  but the logic is exactly the same. What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal  in this case  a mouse  it doesn't initiate virulence right away. It gets in  it starts growing  it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules. It recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack  and the animal dies. What we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections  but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules    so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing  but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide. What we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium    a multi drug resistant pathogenic bacterium    in the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule  in fact  the animal lives. We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around  at least initially  this big problem of resistance. What I hope you think  is that bacteria can talk to each other  they use chemicals as their words  they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about. Of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular. So in the spirit of TED they're doing things together because it makes a difference. What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors  and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals. What I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity. Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years  humans  couple hundred thousand. We think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works. We think  by studying bacteria  we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body. We know that the principles and the rules  if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms  the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well. I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other. By using these two molecules they can say  me  and they can say  you.  Again of course that's what we do  both in a molecular way  and also in an outward way  but I think about the molecular stuff. This is exactly what happens in your body. It's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day  and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on  these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is  and what their tasks should be. Again  we think that bacteria invented that  and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles  but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study. The final thing is  again just to reiterate that there's this practical part  and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics. But then  to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the Earth  we've also made pro quorum sensing molecules. So  we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better. Remember you have these    times or more bacterial cells in you or on you  keeping you healthy. What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you  in the hopes of making you more healthy  making those conversations better  so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own. Finally  I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton  New Jersey. Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture. I hope when you learn things  like about how the natural world works    I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child. Science is done by that demographic. All of those people are between    and    years old  and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country. It's a really lucky demographic to work with. I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age  and it's just a crazy delightful job. I want to thank you for inviting me here. It's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference. Thanks.\n",
      "You may not realize this  but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy. This fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health  and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers. Now  the diagram that you see here  I know it looks like some kind of sports play  but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed. And like writing software  we can print and write DNA into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria. What this program does is produces fluorescent proteins in a rhythmic fashion and generates a small molecule that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize  as you're seeing in this movie. The growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair. Now  what you can't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules  and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off. And the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale  but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast  in larger colonies of bacteria  this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other  and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen. Now  our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing  in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density. You can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie  where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density. Our genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins as the colony grows outwards. This particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova  because it looks like an exploding star. Now  besides programming these beautiful patterns  I wondered  what else can we get these bacteria to do  And I decided to explore how we can program bacteria to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer. One of the surprising facts about bacteria is that they can naturally grow inside of tumors. This happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access  and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive. We started using probiotic bacteria which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit  and found that when orally delivered to mice  these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors. We realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics  and hence  the presence of the tumors  was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine  and so we specifically programmed these probiotics to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer. We went on to show that this technology could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer  one that is challenging to detect otherwise. Now  since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors  we've been programming them to not only detect cancer but also to treat cancer by producing therapeutic molecules from within the tumor environment that shrink the existing tumors  and we've been doing this using quorum sensing programs like you saw in the previous movies. Altogether  imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic that could detect and treat cancer  or even other diseases. Our ability to program bacteria and program life opens up new horizons in cancer research  and to share this vision  I worked with artist Vik Muniz to create the symbol of the universe  made entirely out of bacteria or cancer cells. Ultimately  my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research. Thank you.\n",
      "Miranda Wang  We're here to talk about accidents. How do you feel about accidents  When we think about accidents  we usually consider them to be harmful  unfortunate or even dangerous  and they certainly can be. But are they always that bad  The discovery that had led to penicillin  for example  is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time. Without biologist Alexander Fleming's moldy accident  caused by a neglected workstation  we wouldn't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections. Jeanny Yao  Miranda and I are here today because we'd like to share how our accidents have led to discoveries. In       we visited the Vancouver Waste Transfer Station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste. We realized that when plastics get to the dump  it's difficult to sort them because they have similar densities  and when they're mixed with organic matter and construction debris  it's truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them. MW  However  plastics are useful because they're durable  flexible  and can be easily molded into so many useful shapes. The downside of this convenience is that there's a high cost to this. Plastics cause serious problems  such as the destruction of ecosystems  the pollution of natural resources  and the reduction of available land space. This picture you see here is the Great Pacific Gyre. When you think about plastic pollution and the marine environment  we think about the Great Pacific Gyre  which is supposed to be a floating island of plastic waste. But that's no longer an accurate depiction of plastic pollution in the marine environment. Right now  the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris  and there's nowhere you can go in the ocean where you wouldn't be able to find plastic particles. JY  In a plastic dependent society  cutting down production is a good goal  but it's not enough. And what about the waste that's already been produced  Plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade. So we thought  you know what  Instead of waiting for that garbage to sit there and pile up  let's find a way to break them down with bacteria. Sounds cool  right  Audience  Yeah. JY  Thank you. But we had a problem. You see  plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade. Anyhow  we were curious and hopeful and still wanted to give it a go. MW  With this idea in mind  Jeanny and I read through some hundreds of scientific articles on the Internet  and we drafted a research proposal in the beginning of our grade    year. We aimed to find bacteria from our local Fraser River that can degrade a harmful plasticizer called phthalates. Phthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexibility  durability and transparency. Although they're part of the plastic  they're not covalently bonded to the plastic backbone. As a result  they easily escape into our environment. Not only do phthalates pollute our environment  but they also pollute our bodies. To make the matter worse  phthalates are found in products to which we have a high exposure  such as babies' toys  beverage containers  cosmetics  and even food wraps. Phthalates are horrible because they're so easily taken into our bodies. They can be absorbed by skin contact  ingested  and inhaled. JY  Every year  at least     million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air  water and soil. The Environmental Protection Agency even classified this group as a top priority pollutant because it's been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor. We read that each year  the Vancouver municipal government monitors phthalate concentration levels in rivers to assess their safety. So we figured  if there are places along our Fraser River that are contaminated with phthalates  and if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas  then perhaps  perhaps these bacteria could have evolved to break down phthalates. MW  So we presented this good idea to Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the University of British Columbia  and surprisingly  he actually took us into his lab and asked his graduate students Adam and James to help us. Little did we know at that time that a trip to the dump and some research on the Internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life changing journey of accidents and discoveries. JY  The first step in our project was to collect soil samples from three different sites along the Fraser River. Out of thousands of bacteria  we wanted to find ones that could break down phthalates  so we enriched our cultures with phthalates as the only carbon source. This implied that  if anything grew in our cultures  then they must be able to live off of phthalates. Everything went well from there  and we became amazing scientists.  Laughter  MW  Um... uh  Jeanny. JY  I'm just joking. MW  Okay. Well  it was partially my fault. You see  I accidentally cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture  and as a result  we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice. And this is only one of the examples of the many accidents that happened during our experimentation. But this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous. We noticed that the unharmed cultures came from places of opposite contamination levels  so this mistake actually led us to think that perhaps we can compare the different degradative potentials of bacteria from sites of opposite contamination levels. JY  Now that we grew the bacteria  we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates  because we thought that would be less accident prone  but we were wrong again. We poked holes in our agar while streaking and contaminated some samples and funghi. As a result  we had to streak and restreak several times. Then we monitored phthalate utilization and bacterial growth  and found that they shared an inverse correlation  so as bacterial populations increased  phthalate concentrations decreased. This means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates. MW  So now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates  we wondered what these bacteria were. So Jeanny and I took three of our most efficient strains and then performed gene amplification sequencing on them and matched our data with an online comprehensive database. We were happy to see that  although our three strains had been previously identified bacteria  two of them were not previously associated with phthalate degradation  so this was actually a novel discovery. JY  To better understand how this biodegradation works  we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways of our three strains. To do this  we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid. MW  We monitored this experiment with spectrophotometry and obtained this beautiful graph. This graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates. Our bacteria can transform phthalates  which is a harmful toxin  into end products such as carbon dioxide  water and alcohol. I know some of you in the crowd are thinking  well  carbon dioxide is horrible  it's a greenhouse gas. But if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates  they would have used some other kind of carbon source  and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway. We were also interested to see that  although we've obtained greater diversity of bacteria biodegraders from the bird habitat site  we obtained the most efficient degraders from the landfill site. So this fully shows that nature evolves through natural selection. JY  So Miranda and I shared this research at the Sanofi BioGENEius Challenge competition and were recognized with the greatest commercialization potential. Although we're not the first ones to find bacteria that can break down phthalates  we were the first ones to look into our local river and find a possible solution to a local problem. We have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution  but also that being open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries. Throughout this journey  we have also discovered our passion for science  and are currently continuing research on other fossil fuel chemicals in university. We hope that in the near future  we'll be able to create model organisms that can break down not only phthalates but a wide variety of different contaminants. We can apply this to wastewater treatment plants to clean up our rivers and other natural resources. And perhaps one day we'll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste. MW  I think our journey has truly transformed our view of microorganisms  and Jeanny and I have shown that even mistakes can lead to discoveries. Einstein once said   You can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking you used when you created them.  If we're making plastic synthetically  then we think the solution would be to break them down biochemically. Thank you. JY  Thank you.\n",
      "I collaborate with bacteria. And I'm about to show you some stop motion footage that I made recently where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour. So what you're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing  and as they do so they create an electrical charge. And this attracts metals from their local environment. And these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria. One of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water. And the desalination process is one where we take out salts. We can use it for drinking and agriculture. Removing the salts from water    particularly seawater    through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe. So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane filtration technology. We take the water from the sea and we apply pressure. And this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane. This takes energy  producing clean water. But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution  or brine. But the process is very expensive and it's cost prohibitive for many countries around the globe. And also  the brine that's produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea. And this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it's pumped back out into. So I work in Singapore at the moment  and this is a place that's really a leading place for desalination technology. And Singapore proposes by      to produce       million liters per day of desalinated water. But this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine. And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play. So what we're doing at the moment is we're accumulating metals like calcium  potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine. And this  in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that I just mentioned  equates to a   .  billion mining industry for Singapore    a place that doesn't have any natural resources. So I'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn't existed before  imagine a mining industry that doesn't mean defiling the Earth  imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine. And what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube  a mining industry that is in harmony with nature. Thank you.\n",
      "So it was about four years ago  five years ago  I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia  I think it was  with a bag similar to this. And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag. And I was saying  you don't know this molecule really well  but your body knows it extremely well. And I was thinking that your body hated it  at the time  because we are very immune to this. This is called alpha gal epitope. And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily. Actually our body doesn't hate these. Our body loves these. It eats them. I mean  the cells in our immune system are always hungry. And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell  it means  that's food.  Now  I was thinking about that and I said  you know  we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make  and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff. But I said we can't get rid of it  because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can't get rid of that immunity. And I said  why don't you use that  What if I could stick this molecule  slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me  that had just invaded my lungs  I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there  where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it    it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on. It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you  like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A.  and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car  and then charges you for possession of marijuana. It's like this very fast  very efficient way to get people off the street. So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all  and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street. And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore. Our antibiotics are running out. And  I mean  the world apparently is running out too. So probably it doesn't matter    years from now    streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant    because we won't be here. But if we are    we're going to need something to do with the bacteria. So I started working with this thing  with a bunch of collaborators. And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones  bacteria that we don't like. And I feel now like George Bush. It's like  mission accomplished.  So I might be doing something dumb  just like he was doing at the time. But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work. And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them. This thing can be stuck  like that little green triangle up there  sort of symbolizing this right now. You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer. And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it. So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like  like Staphylococcus    I don't like it in particular  because it killed a professor friend of mine last year. It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it. And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it. That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body  and will alert your immune system to go after it. Here's what happened. See that line on the very top with the little dots  That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in Texas  at Brooks Air Base  with anthrax. And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular  and direct your immune system to it. You'll notice they all lived  the ones on the top line    that's a     percent survival rate. And they actually lived another    days  or    when we finally killed them  and took them apart and figured out what went wrong. Why did they not die  And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore. So we did it. Okay  Mission accomplished \n",

      "I live in Washington  D.C.  but I grew up in Sindhekela  a village in Orissa  in India. My father was a government worker. My mother could not read or write  but she would say to me   A king is  worshipped only in his own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere.  So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up. But I almost didn't go to college until an aunt offered financial help. I went to study in Sambalpur  the largest town in the region  where  already in college  I saw a television for the first time. I had dreams of going to the United States for higher studies. When the opportunity came  I crossed two oceans  with borrowed money for airfare and only a     bill in my pocket. In the U.S.  I worked in a research center  part time  while taking graduate classes in economics. And with the little I earned  I would finance myself and then I would send money home to my brother and my father. My story is not unique. There are millions of people who migrate each year. With the help of the family  they cross oceans  they cross deserts  they cross  rivers  they cross mountains. They risk their lives to realize a dream  and that dream is as simple as having a decent job somewhere so they can send money home and help the family  which has helped them before. There are     million international  migrants in the world. These are people who live in a country other than their country of birth. If there was a country made up of only international migrants  that would be larger  in population  than Brazil. That would be larger  in its size of the economy  than France. Some     million of them  from poor countries  send money home regularly. Those sums of money are called remittances. Here is a fact that might surprise you      billion dollars      billion dollars was the amount of remittances sent last year by migrants to developing countries. Migrants from developing countries  money sent to developing countries       billion dollars. That's a remarkable number because that is three times the size of the total of development aid money. And yet  you and I  my colleagues in Washington  we endlessly debate and discuss about development aid  while we ignore remittances as small change. True  people send     dollars per month  on average. But  repeated month after month  by millions of people  these sums of money add up to rivers  of foreign currency. So India  last year  received     billion dollars  larger than its IT exports. In Egypt remittances are three times the size of revenues from the Suez Canal. In Tajikistan  remittances are    percent of GDP. And in poorer countries  smaller  countries  fragile countries  conflict afflicted countries  remittances are a lifeline  as in Somalia or in Haiti. No wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people. Remittances  unlike private investment money  they don't flow back at the first sign of trouble in the country. They actually act like an insurance. When the family is in trouble  facing hardship  facing hard times  remittances increase  they act like an insurance. Migrants send more money then. Unlike development aid money  that must go through official agencies  through governments  remittances directly reach the poor  reach the family  and often with business advice. So in Nepal  the share of poor people was    percent in       the share of poor people in the population. By       a decade later  at a time of political crisis  economic crisis  the share of poor people went down to    percent. That decline in poverty  most of it  about half of it  is believed to be because of remittances from India  another poor country. In El Salvador  the school dropout rate among children is lower in families that receive remittances. In Mexico and Sri Lanka  the birth weight of children is higher among families that receive remittances. Remittances are dollars wrapped with care. Migrants send money home for food  for buying necessities  for building houses  for funding education  for funding healthcare for the elderly  for business investments for friends and family. Migrants send even more money home for special occasions like a surgery or a wedding. And migrants also send money  perhaps far too many times  for unexpected funerals that they cannot attend. Much as these flows do all that good  there are barriers to these flows of remittances  these     billion dollars of remittances. Foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home. Money transfer companies structure their fees to milk the poor. They will say   Up to     dollars if you want to send  we will charge you    dollars fixed.  If you are poor and if you have  only     dollars to send  you have to pay that     fee. The global average cost of sending money is eight percent. That means you send     dollars  the family on the other side receives only    dollars. To send money to Africa  the cost is even higher     percent. To send money within Africa  the cost is even higher  over    percent. For example  sending money from Benin  to Nigeria. And then there is the case of Venezuela  where  because of exchange controls  you send     dollars and you are lucky if the family on the other side receives even    dollars. Of course  nobody sends money to Venezuela through the official channel. It all goes in suitcases. Whereever costs are high  money goes underground. And what is worse  many developing countries actually have a blanket ban on sending money out of the country. Many rich nations also have a blanket ban on sending money  to specific countries. So  is it that there are no options  no better options  cheaper options  to send money  There are. M Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money and receive money at a fixed cost of only    cents per transaction. U.S. Fed started a program with Mexico to enable money service businesses to send money to Mexico for a fixed cost of only    cents per transaction. And yet  these faster  cheaper  better options can't be applied internationally because of the fear of money laundering  even though there is little data to support any connection  any significant connection between money laundering and these small remittance transactions. Many international banks now are wary of hosting bank accounts of money service businesses  especially those serving Somalia. Somalia  a country where the per capita income is only     dollars per year. Monthly remittances  on average  to Somalia is larger than that amount. Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia. And yet  this is an example of the right hand giving a lot of aid  while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood to that economy  through regulations. Then there is the case of poor people from villages  like me. In the villages  the only place where you can get money is through the post office. Most of the governments in the world have allowed their post offices to have exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies. So  if I have to send money to my father in the village  I must send money through that particular money transfer company  even if the cost is high. I cannot go to a cheaper option. This has to go. So  what can international organizations and social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost of sending money home  First  relax regulations on small remittances under       dollars. Governments should recognize that small remittances are not money laundering. Second  governments should abolish exclusive partnerships between their post office and the money  transfer company. For that matter  between the post office and any national banking system that has a large network that serves the poor. In fact  they should promote competition  open up the partnership so that we will bring down costs like we did  like they did  in the telecommunications industry. You have seen what has happened there. Third  large nonprofit philanthropic organizations should create a remittance platform on a nonprofit basis. They should create a nonprofit remittance platform to serve the money transfer companies so that they can send money at a low cost  while complying with all the complex regulations all over the world. The development community should set a goal of reducing remittance costs to one percent from the current eight percent. If we reduce costs to one percent  that would release a saving of     billion dollars per year. Thirty billion dollars  that's  larger than the entire bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year. That is larger than  or almost similar to  the total aid budget of the United States government  the largest donor on the planet. Actually  the savings would be larger than that    billion because remittance channels are also used for aid  trade and investment purposes. Another major impediment to the flow of remittances reaching the family is the large and exorbitant and illegal cost of recruitment  fees that migrants pay  migrant workers pay to laborers who found them the job. I was in Dubai a few years ago. I visited a camp for workers. It was   in the evening  dark  hot  humid. Workers were coming back from their grueling day of work  and I struck a conversation with a Bangladeshi construction worker. He was preoccupied that he is sending money home  he has been sending money home for a few months now  and the money is mostly going to the recruitment agent  to the labor agent who found him that job. And in my mind  I could picture the wife waiting for the monthly remittance. The remittance arrives. She takes the money and hands it over to the recruitment agent  while the children are looking on. This has to stop. It is not only construction  workers from Bangladesh  it is all the workers. There are millions of migrant workers who suffer from this problem. A construction worker from Bangladesh  on an average  pays about        dollars in recruitment fees for a job that gives him only        dollars per year in income. That means that for the two years or three years of his life  he is basically sending money to pay for the recruitment fees. The family doesn't get to see any of it. It is not only Dubai  it is the dark underbelly of every major city in the world. It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers  it is workers from all over the world. It is not only men. Women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices. One of the most exciting and newest thing happening in the area of remittances is how to mobilize  through innovation  diaspora saving and diaspora giving. Migrants send money home  but they also save a large amount of money where they live. Annually  migrant savings are estimated to be     billion dollars. Most of that money is parked in bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate. If a country were to come  and offer a three percent or four percent interest rate  and then say that the money would be used for building schools  roads  airports  train systems in the country of origin  a lot of migrants would be interested in parting with their money because it's not only financial gains that give them an opportunity to stay engaged with their country's development. Remittance channels can be used to sell these bonds to migrants because when they come on a monthly basis to send remittances  that's when you can actually sell it to them. You can also do the same for mobilizing diaspora giving. I would love to invest in a bullet train system in India and I would love to contribute to efforts to fight malaria in my village. Remittances are a great way of sharing prosperity between places in a targeted way that benefits those who need them most. Remittances empower people. We must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper. And it can be done. As for myself  I have been away from India for two decades now. My wife is a Venezuelan. My children are Americans. Increasingly  I feel like a global citizen. And yet  I am growing nostalgic about my country of birth. I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time. My parents are not there anymore. My brothers and sisters have moved on. There is no real urgency for me to send money home. And yet  from time to time  I send money home to friends  to relatives  to the village  to be there  to stay engaged   that's part of my identity. And  I'm still striving to be a poet for the hardworking migrants and their struggle to break free of the cycle of poverty. Thank you.\n",
      "Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time.

However  to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge  it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated. More importantly  unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable  long term economic growth  we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today  whether it's health care  education or economic development. The fundamental question is this  How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis  They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth  capital  labor and productivity. In particular  these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits  the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling. In a similar vein  how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets  where    percent of the world's population lives and where  on average     percent of the population is under the age of     In these countries  it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation. And yet today  the largest emerging economies    countries with at least    million people    continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark. Worse than that  countries like India  Russia  South Africa  Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and  in many cases  actually regressing. Economic growth matters. With economic growth  countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility  opportunity and improved living standards. Without growth  countries contract and atrophy  not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived. Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual. If growth wanes  the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises  and societies become dimmer  coarser and smaller. The context matters. And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries. Now  I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition. There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth. You worry about the overpopulation of the planet. And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have    billion people on the planet before it plateaus in       you're concerned about what that does to natural resources    arable land  potable water  energy and minerals. You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment. And you worry about how man  embodied in the corporate globalist  has become greedy and corrupt. But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world. And more importantly  it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism. The definition of capitalism  very simply put  is that the factors of production  such as trade and industry  capital and labor  are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state. It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism. And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term  we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance. Economic growth needs capitalism  but it needs it to work properly. And as I mentioned a moment ago  the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors. And even this  however  is a very simplistic dichotomy. Capitalism  good  non capitalism  bad. When in practical experience  capitalism is much more of a spectrum. And we have countries such as China  which have practiced more state capitalism  and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist. Our efforts to critique the capitalist system  however  have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism. However  there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism  particularly those embodied by the United States. This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and  worse still  it's increasing income inequality    the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many. The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills. In order to think about that framing  we have to ask ourselves  how does capitalism work today  Very simplistically  capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer    a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants. And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts. Of course  in this system governments do tax  and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs  recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods. But nevertheless  this framework    this two stage framework    is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model. I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge. First of all  we can draw on the right wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism. In particular  right leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers  where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth. For example  sending children to school  parents could earn money for that  or getting their children inoculated or immunized  parents could get paid for doing that. Now  quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway  the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico  in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York. But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left leaning policies. Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China. But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs. Things like the corporate social responsibility programs  albeit small in scale  are moving in that right direction. Of course  left leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government  NGOs and private sector. Two very good examples of this are the   th century United States  when the infrastructure rollout was really about public private partnerships. More recently  of course  the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society. My fundamental message to you is this  We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological. In order to create sustainable  long term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today  we're going to have to be more broad minded about what might work. Ultimately  we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  I want to ask a couple of questions  Dambisa  because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology  it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times. What do you say to those who react that way  DM  Well  I think that that's completely legitimate  and I think that we're already having that discussion. There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards. And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world. BG  So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth  but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth  to take us on a long journey  is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources. Do you see that happening  DM  Well  I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity. I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite  scarce and depleting resources that we know today  we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is. However  we've seen the Club of Rome  we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources  and it's not to argue that those things are not valid. But I think  with ingenuity we could see desalination  I think we could reinvest in energy  so that we can actually get better outcomes. And so in that sense  I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do. BG  The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism    with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues. Is that what you're suggesting  DM  I'm suggesting we have to be open minded. I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to. And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world  the United States  has democracy  liberal democracy  as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism    to the extent that it is free    free market capitalism as its economic stance. The second largest economy is China. It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism  which is a completely different model. These two countries  completely different political models and completely different economic models  and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient. I think those are the debates we should have  because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting  and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don't know. BG  One last question. The COP   is going on in Paris. If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there  what would you say  DM  Again  I would be very much about being open minded. As you're aware  the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now    in Copenhagen  '   in Stockholm    and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement  in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want. Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries. Developed countries recognize that they have a real  important responsibility not only just to manage their CO  emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world  but also as trendsetters in R D. And so they have to come to the table as well. But in essence  it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets. BG  Dambisa  thank you for coming to TED. DM  Thank you very much.\n",
      "So here's the most important economic fact of our time. We are living in an age of surging income inequality  particularly between those at the very top and everyone else. This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.  but it's a global phenomenon. It's happening in communist China  in formerly communist Russia  it's happening in India  in my own native Canada. We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies like Sweden  Finland and Germany. Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening. In the     s  the One Percent accounted for about    percent of the national income in the United States. Today  their share has more than doubled to above    percent. But what's even more striking is what's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution. The  .  percent in the U.S. today account for more than eight percent of the national income. They are where the One Percent was    years ago. Let me give you another number to put that in perspective  and this is a figure that was calculated in      by Robert Reich  the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men  Bill Gates and Warren Buffett  and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth of the bottom    percent of the U.S. population      million people. Now  as it happens  Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat  he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon  and he has his own favorite number. Buffett likes to point out that in       the combined wealth of the people on the Forbes     list    and this is the list of the     richest Americans    was     billion dollars. Just think about it. You didn't even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in     . Well  today  that figure has more than quintupled to  .  trillion  and I probably don't need to tell you that we haven't seen anything similar happen to the middle class  whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased. So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy  but we've been slow to notice it. One of the reasons  I think  is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon. Changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic. Think about what happened  after all  to the poor frog. But I think there's something else going on. Talking about income inequality  even if you're not on the Forbes     list  can make us feel uncomfortable. It feels less positive  less optimistic  to talk about how the pie is sliced than to think about how to make the pie bigger. And if you do happen to be on the Forbes     list  talking about income distribution  and inevitably its cousin  income redistribution  can be downright threatening. So we're living in the age of surging income inequality  especially at the top. What's driving it  and what can we do about it  One set of causes is political  lower taxes  deregulation  particularly of financial services  privatization  weaker legal protections for trade unions  all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very  very top. A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of  crony capitalism   political changes that benefit a group of well connected insiders but don't actually do much good for the rest of us. In practice  getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult. Think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia  for instance  or how hard it is to re regulate the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the Great Depression  or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies  including those whose motto might be  don't do evil   to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class. But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice is really  really hard  at least intellectually  it's an easy problem. After all  no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism. Indeed  this is one of those rare issues that unites the left and the right. A critique of crony capitalism is as central to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street. But if crony capitalism is  intellectually at least  the easy part of the problem  things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality. In and of themselves  these aren't too mysterious. Globalization and the technology revolution  the twin economic transformations which are changing our lives and transforming the global economy  are also powering the rise of the super rich. Just think about it. For the first time in history  if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea or a fantastic new product  you have almost instant  almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people. As a result  if you are very  very smart and very  very lucky  you can get very  very rich very  very quickly. The latest poster boy for this phenomenon is David Karp. The    year old founder of Tumblr recently sold his company to Yahoo for  .  billion dollars. Think about that for a minute   .  billion dollars     years old. It's easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields  like sports and entertainment. We can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before. But today  that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy. We have superstar technologists. We have superstar bankers. We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects. There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers. There are even  and this is my personal favorite example  superstar dentists  the most dazzling exemplar of whom is Bernard Touati  the Frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich or European born American fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution are creating this global plutocracy  what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it. And that's because  in contrast with crony capitalism  so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive. Let's start with technology. I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices. I love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium. I'm even more of a fan of globalization. This is the transformation which has lifted hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people out of poverty and into the middle class  and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world  it's made many new products affordable    who do you think built your iPhone    and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper. Think of your dishwasher or your t shirt. So what's not to like  Well  a few things. One of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy. Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur who has successfully sold that idea or that product to the global billions and become a billionaire in the process. It gets tempting at that point to use your economic nous to manipulate the rules of the global political economy in your own favor. And that's no mere hypothetical example. Think about Amazon  Apple  Google  Starbucks. These are among the world's most admired  most beloved  most innovative companies. They also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very  very significantly. And why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage  Once you have the tremendous economic power that we're seeing at the very  very top of the income distribution and the political power that inevitably entails  it becomes tempting as well to start trying to change the rules of the game in your own favor. Again  this is no mere hypothetical. It's what the Russian oligarchs did in creating the sale of the century privatization of Russia's natural resources. It's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the U.S. and the U.K. A second thing that worries me is how easily meritocratic plutocracy can become aristocracy. One way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks  and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy. That's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children. The middle class is spending more on schooling too  but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at Harvard  Stanford or MIT  the    percent is increasingly outgunned by the One Percent. The result is something that economists Alan Krueger and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve. As income inequality increases  social mobility decreases. The plutocracy may be a meritocracy  but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race. The third thing  and this is what worries me the most  is the extent to which those same largely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy also happen to be hollowing out the middle class in Western industrialized economies. Let's start with technology. Those same forces that are creating billionaires are also devouring many traditional middle class jobs. When's the last time you used a travel agent  And in contrast with the industrial revolution  the titans of our new economy aren't creating that many new jobs. At its zenith  G.M. employed hundreds of thousands  Facebook fewer than       . The same is true of globalization. For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets  it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed Western economies. The terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity. That's shown in what I consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time. Since the late     s  increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment. That means that our countries are getting richer  our companies are getting more efficient  but we're not creating more jobs and we're not paying people  as a whole  more. One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment. What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario. After all  in a totally free labor market  we could find jobs for pretty much everyone. The dystopia that worries me is a universe in which a few geniuses invent Google and its ilk and the rest of us are employed giving them massages. So when I get really depressed about all of this  I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution. After all  for all its grim  satanic mills  it worked out pretty well  didn't it  After all  all of us here are richer  healthier  taller    well  there are a few exceptions   and live longer than our ancestors in the early   th century. But it's important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society  we had to go through two depressions  the Great Depression of the     s  the Long Depression of the     s  two world wars  communist revolutions in Russia and in China  and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the West. We also  not coincidentally  went through an era of tremendous social and political inventions. We created the modern welfare state. We created public education. We created public health care. We created public pensions. We created unions. Today  we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the Industrial Revolution. To be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats  we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change. We need a new New Deal.\n",
      "Clearly  we're living in a moment of crisis. Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us  and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive. Because of some of technologies we've been talking about. Because of the resources  the skills  and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world  with the mindset to create change. And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen  who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower  but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world. And by definition  every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul  a global citizen. You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another. And no matter what country you live or work in  you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of  even in their most ordinariness. Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty  how best we release their energies. On the one hand  we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out. And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid. And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems. We call it patient capital. The critics point to the     billion dollars spent in Africa since      and say  and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty  rampant corruption  They use Mobutu as metaphor. And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable  focus on the capital markets  invest  don't give anything away. On the other side  as I said  there are those who say the problem is that we need more money. That when it comes to the rich  we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid  but when it comes to our poor brethren  we want little to do with it. They point to the successes of aid  the eradication of smallpox  and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals. Both sides are right. And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other. Even more problematic  they're not listening to poor people themselves. After    years of working on issues of poverty and innovation  it's true that there are probably no more market oriented individuals on the planet than low income people. They must navigate markets daily  making micro decisions  dozens and dozens  to move their way through society  and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family  they could be put back into poverty  sometimes for generations. And so we need both the market and we need aid. Patient capital works between  and tries to take the best of both. It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare  water  housing  alternative energy  thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity  but as individual customers  consumers  clients  people who want to make decisions in their own lives. Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk  a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment  to use the market as the best listening device that we have  and the expectation of below market returns  but outsized social impact. It recognizes that the market has its limitation  and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people. Now  entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons. First  they tend to work in markets where people make one  two  three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level. Second  the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure    no roads to speak of  sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption. Third  they are often creating markets. Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages  it is something new. And so many low income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time  takes a lot of patience. It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance. Not only to build the systems  the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way  but to connect those business to other markets  to governments  to corporations    real partnerships if we want to get to scale. I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation. In      I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India  who'd been working for    years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet. And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low income farmers altogether  despite the fact that     million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day. They were creating subsidies either for large farms  or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use  rather than that the farmers wanted to use. At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel. It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant. And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green. But the market also had bypassed low income farmers  because these systems were both too expensive  and they were constructed for fields that were too large. The average small village farmer works on two acres or less. And so  Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves  because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have. And he used three fundamental principles. The first one was miniaturization. The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre  even if he had two  because it was too frightening  given all that he had at stake. Second  it had to be extremely affordable. In other words  that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest  or else they wouldn't take the risk. And third  it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable. What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre  the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth. As of today  IDE India  Amitabha's organization  has sold over         farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average  but this didn't happen overnight. In fact  when you go back to the beginning  there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day  that were known to be some of the most risk averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors  agriculture. And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research  to experiment  to fail  to innovate and try again. And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers  that's when patient capital could come in. And we helped him build a company  for profit  that would build on IDE's knowledge  and start looking at sales and exports  and be able to tap into other kinds of capital. Secondarily  we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries. And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan. And while  again  you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan  just to get the permits  over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono  who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert  which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country. And though that company has just started  our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions. But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation. We're starting to see these happening all around the world. In Arusha  Tanzania  A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us  with UNICEF  with the Global Fund  to create a factory that now employs       people  mostly women. And they produce    million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world. Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality  affordable maternal health care to low income women  and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every    days. And      Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry  building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth  a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access  and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption. So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder  and are now beginning to scale  because of partnership. They've just won four government contracts to build off their     ambulances  and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India. This idea of scale is critical. Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people. But that's obviously not enough. And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important. Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets  government itself  or partner with major corporations  there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation. President Obama understands that. He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country  and look at how we can scale it. And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations  not only for their country  but ones that we can use in the developed world as well. Invest financial assistance  but also management assistance. And then measure the returns  both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective. When we think about new approaches to aid  it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan. We've had a rocky relationship with that country and  in all fairness  the United States has not always been a very reliable partner. But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen. And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund  we could use this time to invest not directly in government  though we would have government's blessing  nor in international experts  but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country. People like Rashani Zafar  who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country  and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country. And Tasneem Siddiqui  who developed a way called incremental housing  where he has moved        slum dwellers into safe  affordable community housing. Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country. It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban. I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now  and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population  and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature. President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. I would say that the converse is true. That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the    percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day  provide real pathways to hope. And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan  while we need to strengthen the judiciary  build greater stability  we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world. On one of my last visits to Pakistan  I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert. And we left Karachi one morning before dawn. It was about     degrees. And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape like landscape with very little color  lots of heat  very little discussion  because we were exhausted. And finally  at the end of the journey  I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon. And as we got closer  its significance became apparent. That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall. Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life. His name was Raja  and he had kind  twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father. And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his    children and    grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about    cents a day. Because he was building these crops. And with the money he earned he could stay this year. And for the first time ever in three generations  his children would go to school. We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons. And he said   Of course I will. Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore.  When we think about solutions to poverty  we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity. Because at the end of the day  dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity. Because that is where dignity really starts. Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental  and that power without love is reckless and abusive. Our generation has seen both approaches tried  and often fail. But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power. For that is what we'll need  as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us  and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet. The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions  a cross sector  is now. I can only talk from my own experience  but in eight years of running Acumen fund  I've seen the power of patient capital. Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking  but to truly build systems that have created more than        jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet. I know it works. But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work. And so I urge you  in whatever sector you work  in whatever job you do  to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help. Rather than what we think that they might need. It will take embracing the world with both arms. And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability  with a sense of integrity and perseverance. And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations. And there is so much good that we can do. Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert. Thank you.\n",
      "It's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment when the finance  the credit  which drives our economies froze. A massive cardiac arrest. The effect  the payback  perhaps  for years of vampire predators like Bernie Madoff  whom we saw earlier. Abuse of steroids  binging and so on. And it's only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat. And we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone  where no one quite knows what's worked  or what doesn't. We don't have any very clear maps  any compass to guide us. We don't know which experts to believe anymore. What I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis  what things we should be looking out for and how we can actually use the crisis. There's a definition of leadership which says   It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis for the biggest possible effect.  And I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis  which is by no means small  really is used to the full. I want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from. I've got a very confused background which perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times. I've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms  as you can see. I trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy. I've been a civil servant  and I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well. But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city  this university  as a student. And then as now  it was a beautiful place of balls and punts  beautiful people  many of whom took to heart Ronald Reagan's comment that   even if they say hard work doesn't do you any harm  why risk it   But when I was here  a lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation  leaving school at a time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment  and essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities. And I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts. And they were people who were not short of wit  or grace or energy  but they had no hope  no jobs  no prospects. And when people aren't allowed to be useful  they soon think that they're useless. And although that was great for the music business at the time  it wasn't much good for anything else. And ever since then  I've wondered why it is that capitalism is so amazingly efficient at some things  but so inefficient at others  why it's so innovative in some ways and so un innovative in others. Now  since that time  we've actually been through an extraordinary boom  the longest boom ever in the history of this country. Unprecedented wealth and prosperity  but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed. H.L. Mencken once said that   to every complex problem  there is a simple solution and it's wrong.  But I'm not saying growth is wrong  but it's very striking that throughout the years of growth  many things didn't get better. Rates of depression carried on up  right across the Western world. If you look at America  the proportion of Americans with no one to talk to about important things went up from a tenth to a quarter. We commuted longer to work  but as you can see from this graph  the longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be. And it became ever clearer that economic growth doesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth. We're now at another moment when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market. There will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year  thousands losing their jobs everyday in America. We've got to do whatever we can to help them  but we've also got to ask  I think  a more profound question of whether we use this crisis to jump forward to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs  to a better balance of economy and society. And I think one of the lessons of history is that even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity. They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream. They often lead to the acceleration of much needed reforms. And you saw that in the '  s  when the Great Depression paved the way for Bretton Woods  welfare states and so on. And I think you can see around us now  some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow. You can see it in daily life. When times are hard  people have to do things for themselves  and right across the world  Oxford  Omaha  Omsk  you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming  people taking over land  taking over roofs  turning barges into temporary farms. And I'm a very small part of this. I have        of these things in my garden. A few of these. This is Atilla the hen. And I'm a very small part of a very large movement  which for some people is about survival  but is also about values  about a different kind of economy  which isn't so much about consumption and credit  but about things which matter to us. And everywhere too  you can see a proliferation of time banks and parallel currencies  people using smart technologies to link up all the resources freed up by the market    people  buildings  land    and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs. There's a similar story  I think  for governments. Ronald Reagan  again  said the two funniest sentences in the English language are   I'm from the government. And I'm here to help.  But I think last year when governments did step in  people were quite glad that they were there  that they did act. But now  a few months on  however good politicians are at swallowing frogs without pulling a face  as someone once put it  they can't hide their uncertainty. Because it's already clear how much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy  really went into fixing the past  bailing out the banks  the car companies  not preparing us for the future. How much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption  not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve. And everywhere  as people think about the unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our children's money  now  in the depth of this crisis  they're asking  Surely  we should be using this with a longer term vision to accelerate the shift to a green economy  to prepare for aging  to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and the United States rather than just giving the money to the incumbents  Surely  we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs  to civil society  for people able to create the new  not to the big  well connected companies  big  clunky government programs. And  after all this  as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said   Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish. Don't overdo it.  And I think more and more people are also asking  Why boost consumption  rather than change what we consume  Like the mayor of S o Paulo who's banned advertising billboards  or the many cities like San Francisco putting in infrastructures for electric cars. You can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world. Some  I think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing. But ask yourselves  What will be the biggest sectors of the economy in            years time  It won't be the ones lining up for handouts  like cars and aerospace and so on. The biggest sector  by far  will be health    already    percent of the American economy  predicted to grow to     even    percent by mid century. Elder care  child care  already much bigger employers than cars. Education  six  seven  eight percent of the economy and growing. Environmental services  energy services  the myriad of green jobs  they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy which isn't just about products  but is using distributed networks  and it's founded above all on care  on relationships  on what people do to other people  often one to one  rather than simply selling them a product. And I think that what connects the challenge for civil society  the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now is  in a way  a very simple one  but quite a difficult one. We know our societies have to radically change. We know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis. But we also know it's only through experiment that we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city  how to care for a much older population  how to deal with drug addiction and so on. And here's the problem. In science  we do experiments systematically. Our societies now spend two  three  four percent of GDP to invest systematically in new discovery  in science  in technology  to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions which illuminate gatherings like this. It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago  maybe they are  but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did. And what's striking though  is that in society there's almost nothing comparable  no comparable investment  no systematic experiment  in the things capitalism isn't very good at  like compassion  or empathy  or relationships or care. Now  I didn't really understand that until I met this guy who was then an    year old  slightly shambolic man who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated. He had helped shape Britain's post war institutions  its welfare state  its economy  but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur  became an inventor of many  many different organizations. Some famous ones like the Open University  which has         students  the University of the Third Age  which has nearly half a million older people teaching other older people  as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs. And he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists. He believed if you see a problem  you shouldn't tell someone to act  you should act on it yourself  and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer. And his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers  not from a theory  but from experiment  and experiment involving the people with the best intelligence on social needs  which were usually the people living with those needs. And he believed we live with others  we share the world with others and therefore our innovation must be done with others too  not doing things at people  for them  and so on. Now  what he did didn't used to have a name  but I think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream. It's what we do in the organization named after him where we try and invent  create  launch new ventures  whether it's schools  web companies  health organizations and so on. And we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation  using ideas from design or technology or community organizing to develop the germs of a future world  but through practice and through demonstration and not through theory. And they're spreading from Korea to Brazil to India to the USA and across Europe. And they've been given new momentum by the crisis  by the need for better answers to joblessness  community breakdown and so on. Some of the ideas are strange. These are complaints choirs. People come together to sing about the things that really bug them. Others are much more pragmatic  health coaches  learning mentors  job clubs. And some are quite structural  like social impact bonds where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital  and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are. Now  the idea that all of this represents  I think  is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis  recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress. There were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country  as well as a public service innovation lab. Across northern Europe  many governments now have innovation laboratories within them. And just a few months ago  President Obama launched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House. And what people are beginning to ask is  Surely  just as we invest in R and D  two  three  four percent  of our GDP  of our economy  what if we put  let's say  one percent of public spending into social innovation  into elder care  new kinds of education  new ways of helping the disabled  Perhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society to those we've had in the economy and in technology. And if  a generation or two ago  the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon  perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition  stopping trafficking  or one  I think closer to home for America or Europe  why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens. Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade  but only with radical and systematic experiment  not just with technologies  but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too. Now  I want to end by saying a little bit about what I think this means for capitalism. I think what this is all about  this whole movement which is growing from the margins  remains quite small. Nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont. What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social. It's already immersed in social networks. It will become more involved in social investment  and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others  not just from what you sell to them  and from relationships as well as from consumption. But interestingly too  it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism about how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation into society  trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work. Now  I think this future will be quite surprising to many people. In recent years  a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won. History was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy. But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy     years ago  just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France. Then  people said monarchy dominated everywhere because it was rooted in human nature. We were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy. Just as today  the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature  only now it's individualism  inquisitiveness  and so on. Then monarchy had seen off its big challenger  mass democracy  which was seen as a well intentioned but doomed experiment  just as capitalism has seen off socialism. Even Fidel Castro now says that the only thing worse than being exploited by multinational capitalism is not being exploited by multinational capitalism. And whereas then monarchies  palaces and forts dominated every city skyline and looked permanent and confident  today it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city. I'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost  though that might be quite tempting. But I do think we're on the verge of a period when  just as happened to the monarchy and  interestingly  the military too  the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end  and it's going to steadily move to the sides  the margins of our society  transformed from being a master into a servant  a servant to the productive economy and of human needs. And as that happens  we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism  which is that  unlike what you read in economics textbooks  it's not a self sufficient system. It depends on other systems  on ecology  on family  on community  and if these aren't replenished  capitalism suffers too. And our human nature isn't just selfish  it's also compassionate. It's not just competitive  it's also caring. Because of the depth of the crisis  I think we are at a moment of choice. The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us. It will be worse at the end of this year  quite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today. But this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago  and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for  or whether this is a moment to jump ahead  to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway.

      "It's an amazing thing that we're here to talk about the year of patients rising. You heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases  patients who are saying   You know what  I know what the odds are  but I'm going to go look for more information. I'm going to define what the terms of my success are.  I'm going to be sharing with you how four years ago I almost died    found out I was  in fact  already almost dead. And what I then found out about what's called the e Patient movement    I'll explain what that term means. I had been blogging under the name Patient Dave  and when I discovered this  I just renamed myself e Patient Dave. Regarding the word  patient   when I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer  I noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who's not in the room here  somebody out there. Some of our talks today  we still act like that. But I'm here to tell you   patient  is not a third person word. You  yourself  will find yourself in a hospital bed    or your mother  your child    there are heads nodding  people who say   Yes  I know exactly what you mean.  So when you hear what I'm going to talk about here today  first of all  I want to say that I am here on behalf of all the patients that I have ever met  all the ones I haven't met. This is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care  in fixing health care. One of the senior doctors at my hospital  Charlie Safran  and his colleague  Warner Slack  have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient. They have been saying that since the     s. Now I'm going to step back in history. This is from July      . I was a freshman in college  and this was when we first landed on the Moon. And it was the first time we had ever seen from another surface    that's the place where you and I are right now  where we live. The world was changing. It was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee. A few weeks later  Woodstock happened. Three days of fun and music. Here  just for historical authenticity  is a picture of me in that year. Yeah  the wavy hair  the blue eyes    it was really something. That Fall of       the Whole Earth Catalog came out. It was a hippie journal of self sufficiency. We think of hippies of being just hedonists  but there's a very strong component    I was in that movement    a very strong component of being responsible for yourself. This book's title's subtitle is   Access to Tools.  And it talked about how to build your own house  how to grow your own food  all kinds of things. In the     s  this young doctor  Tom Ferguson  was the medical editor of the Whole Earth Catalog. And he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves. In fact  he said it was    to    percent of how we actually take care of our bodies. Well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease  the key thing that holds us back is access to information. And when the Web came along  that changed everything  because not only could we find information  we could find other people like ourselves who could gather  who could bring us information. And he coined this term e Patients    equipped  engaged  empowered  enabled. Obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then. Now I was an engaged patient long before I ever heard of the term. In       I went to my doctor for a regular physical  and I had said   I have a sore shoulder.  Well  I got an X ray  and the next morning    you may have noticed  those of you who have been through a medical crisis will understand this. This morning  some of the speakers named the date when they found out about their condition. For me  it was      AM on January        . I was at the office  my desk was clean  I had the blue partition carpet on the walls. The phone rang and it was my doctor. He said   Dave  I pulled up the X ray image on the screen on the computer at home.  He said   Your shoulder's going to be fine  but Dave  there's something in your lung.  And if you look in that red oval  that shadow was not supposed to be there. To make a long story short  I said   So you need me to get back in there   He said   Yeah  we're going to need to do a CT scan of your chest.  And in parting I said   Is there anything I should do   He said    think about this one. This is the advice your doctor gives you   just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife.  I went in for the CAT scan  and it turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs. So at that point we knew that it was cancer. We knew it wasn't lung cancer. That meant it was metastasized from somewhere. The question was  where from  So I went in for an ultrasound. I got to do what many women have    the jelly on the belly and bzzzz. My wife came with me. She's a veterinarian  so she's seen lots of ultrasounds. I mean  she knows I'm not a dog. But what we saw    this is an MRI image. This is much sharper than an ultrasound would be. What we saw in that kidney was that big blob there. And there were actually two of these. One was growing out the front and it had already erupted  and it latched onto the bowel. One was growing out the back  and it attached to the soleus muscle  which is a big muscle in the back that I'd never heard of  but all of a sudden I cared about it. I went home. Now I've been Googling    I've been online since      on CompuServe. I went home  and I know you can't read the details here  that's not important. My point is I went to a respected medical website  WebMD  because I know how to filter out junk. I also found my wife online. Before I met her  I went through some suboptimal search results. So I looked for quality information. There's so much about trust    what sources of information can we trust  Where does my body end and an invader start  And cancer  a tumor  is something you grow out of your own tissue. How does that happen  Where does medical ability end and start  Well  so what I read on WebMD   The prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer. Almost all patients are incurable.  I've been online long enough to know if I don't like the first results I get  I go look for more. And what I found was on other websites  even by the third page of Google results   Outlook is bleak    Prognosis is grim.  And I'm thinking   What the heck   I didn't feel sick at all. I mean  I'd been getting tired in the evening  but I was    years old. I was slowly losing weight  but for me  that was what the doctor told me to do. It was really something. And this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug I eventually got. Totally by coincidence  there's that thing in my lung. In the left femur  the left thigh bone  there's another one. I had one. My leg eventually snapped. I fainted and landed on it  and it broke. There's one in the skull  and then just for good measure  I had these other tumors    including  by the time my treatment started  one was growing out of my tongue. I had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue. And what I read was that my median survival was    weeks. This was bad. I was facing the grave. I thought   What's my mother's face going to look like on the day of my funeral   I had to sit down with my daughter and say   Here's the situation.  Her boyfriend was with her. I said   I don't want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while Dad's still alive.  It's really serious. Because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help  think about this. Well  my doctor prescribed a patient community  Acor.org  a network of cancer patients  of all amazing things. Very quickly they told me   Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease. Get yourself to a specialist center. There is no cure  but there's something that sometimes works    it usually doesn't    called high dosage interleukin. Most hospitals don't offer it  so they won't even tell you it exists. And don't let them give you anything else first. And by the way  here are four doctors in your part of the United States who offer it and their phone numbers.  How amazing is that  Here's the thing. Here we are  four years later  you can't find a website that gives patients that information. Government approved  American Cancer Society  but patients know what patients want to know. It's the power of patient networks. This amazing substance    again I mentioned  where does my body end  My oncologist and I talk a lot these days because I try to keep my talks technically accurate. And he said   You know  the immune system is good at detecting invaders    bacteria coming from outside    but when it's your own tissue that you've grown  it's a whole different thing.  And I went through a mental exercise actually  because I started a patient support community of my own on a website  and one of my friends  one of my relatives actually  said   Look  Dave  who grew this thing  Are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself   So we went into it. And the story of how all that happens is in this book. Anyway  this is the way the numbers unfolded. Me being me  I put the numbers from my hospital's website from my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet. Don't worry about the numbers. You see  that's the immune system. Amazing thing  those two yellow lines are where I got the two doses of interleukin two months apart. And look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between. Just incredible. Who knows what we'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it. The punch line is that a year and a half later  I was there when this magnificent young woman  my daughter  got married. And when she came down those steps  and it was just her and me for that moment  I was so glad that she didn't have to say to her mother   I wish Dad could have been here.  And this is what we're doing when we make health care better. Now I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care. This is Regina Holliday  a painter in Washington D.C.  whose husband died of kidney cancer a year after my disease. She's painting here a mural of his horrible final weeks in the hospital. One of the things that she discovered was that her husband's medical record in this paper folder was just disorganized. And she thought   You know  if I have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box  why can't there be something that simple telling every new nurse who comes on duty  every new doctor  the basics about my husband's condition   So she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label  something like that  in a diagram of him. She then  last year  painted this diagram. She studied health care like me. She came to realize that there were a lot of people who'd written patient advocate books that you just don't hear about at medical conferences. Patients are such an underutilized resource. Well as it says in my introduction  I've gotten somewhat known for saying that patients should have access to their data. And I actually said at one conference a couple of years ago   Give me my damn data  because you people can't be trusted to keep it clean.  And here she has our damned data    it's a pun    which is starting to break out  starting to break through    the water symbolizes our data. And in fact  I want to do a little something improvisational for you here. There's a guy on Twitter that I know  a health IT guy outside Boston  and he wrote the e Patient rap. And it goes like this.   Gimme my damn data     I want to be an e Patient just like Dave     Gimme my damn data  cuz it's my life to save   Now I'm not going to go any further. Well thank you. That shot the timing. Think about the possibility  why is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family  Here's a website  VisibleBody.com  that I stumbled across. And I thought   You know  I wonder what my soleus muscle is   So you can click on things and remove it. And I saw   Aha  that's the kidney and the soleus muscle.  And I was rotating it in  D and saying   I understand now.  And then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth  where you can fly to any address. And I thought   Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data and have Google Earth for my body   What did Google come out with this year  Now there's Google Body browser. But you see  it's still generic. It's not my data. But if we can get that data out from behind the dam so software innovators can pounce on it  the way software innovators like to do  who knows what we'll be able to come up with. One final story  this is Kelly Young  a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida. This is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks. RA patients  as they call themselves    her blog is RA Warrior    have a big problem because    percent of them have no visible symptoms. And that makes it just really hard to tell how the disease is going. And some doctors think   Yeah right  you're really in pain.  Well she found  through her online research  a nuclear bone scan that's usually used for cancer  but it can also reveal inflammation. And she saw that if there is no inflammation then the scan is a uniform gray. So she took it. And the radiologist report said   No cancer found.  Well that's not what he was supposed to do with it. So she had it read again  she wanted to have it read again  and her doctor fired her. She pulled up the CD. He said   If you don't want to follow my instructions  go away.  So she pulled up the CD of the scan images  and look at all those hot spots. And she's now actively engaged on her blog in looking for assistance in getting better care. See  that is an empowered patient    no medical training. We are  you are  the most underused resource in health care. What she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data. How big a deal was this  Well at TED      Tim Berners Lee himself  inventor of the Web  gave a talk where he said the next big thing is not to have your browser go out and find other people's articles about the data  but the raw data. And he got them chanting by the end of the talk   Raw data now. Raw data now.  And I ask you  three words  please  to improve health care  let patients help. Let patients help. Let patients help. Let patients help. Thank you. For all the patients around the world watching this on the webcast  God bless you  everyone    let patients help. Host  And bless yourself. Thank you very much.\n",
      "They told me that I'm a traitor to my own profession  that I should be fired  have my medical license taken away  that I should go back to my own country. My email got hacked. In a discussion forum for other doctors  someone took credit for  Twitter bombing  my account. Now  I didn't know if this was a good or bad thing  but then came the response   Too bad it wasn't a real bomb.  I never thought that I would do something that would provoke this level of anger among other doctors. Becoming a doctor was my dream. I grew up in China  and my earliest memories are of being rushed to the hospital because I had such bad asthma that I was there nearly every week. I had this one doctor  Dr. Sam  who always took care of me. She was about the same age as my mother. She had this wild  curly hair  and she always wore these bright yellow flowery dresses. She was one of those doctors who  if you fell and you broke your arm  she would ask you why you weren't laughing because it's your humerus. Get it  See  you'd groan  but she'd always make you feel better after having seen her. Well  we all have that childhood hero that we want to grow up to be just like  right  Well  I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam. When I was eight  my parents and I moved to the U.S.  and ours became the typical immigrant narrative. My parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed dishes and pumped gas so that I could pursue my dream. Well  eventually I learned enough English  and my parents were so happy the day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service. But then one day  everything changed. My mother called me to tell me that she wasn't feeling well  she had a cough that wouldn't go away  she was short of breath and tired. Well  I knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything. For her to tell me that something was the matter  I knew something had to be really wrong. And it was  We found out that she had stage IV breast cancer  cancer that by then had spread to her lungs  her bones  and her brain. My mother was brave  though  and she had hope. She went through surgery and radiation  and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book. She tried to look up her oncologist's phone number on the Internet and she found it  but she found something else too. On several websites  he was listed as a highly paid speaker to a drug company  and in fact often spoke on behalf of the same chemo regimen that he had prescribed her. She called me in a panic  and I didn't know what to believe. Maybe this was the right chemo regimen for her  but maybe it wasn't. It made her scared and it made her doubt. When it comes to medicine  having that trust is a must  and when that trust is gone  then all that's left is fear. There's another side to this fear. As a medical student  I was taking care of this    year old who was biking back to his dorm when he got struck and hit  run over by an SUV. He had seven broken ribs  shattered hip bones  and he was bleeding inside his belly and inside his brain. Now  imagine being his parents who flew in from Seattle        miles away  to find their son in a coma. I mean  you'd want to find out what's going on with him  right  They asked to attend our bedside rounds where we discussed his condition and his plan  which I thought was a reasonable request  and also would give us a chance to show them how much we were trying and how much we cared. The head doctor  though  said no. He gave all kinds of reasons. Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way. Maybe they'll stop students from asking questions. He even said   What if they see mistakes and sue us   What I saw behind every excuse was deep fear  and what I learned was that to become a doctor  we have to put on our white coats  put up a wall  and hide behind it. There's a hidden epidemic in medicine. Of course  patients are scared when they come to the doctor. Imagine you wake up with this terrible bellyache  you go to the hospital  you're lying in this strange place  you're on this hospital gurney  you're wearing this flimsy gown  strangers are coming to poke and prod at you. You don't know what's going to happen. You don't even know if you're going to get the blanket you asked for    minutes ago. But it's not just patients who are scared  doctors are scared too. We're scared of patients finding out who we are and what medicine is all about. And so what do we do  We put on our white coats and we hide behind them. Of course  the more we hide  the more people want to know what it is that we're hiding. The more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor medical care. We don't just have a fear of sickness  we have a sickness of fear. Can we bridge this disconnect between what patients need and what doctors do  Can we overcome the sickness of fear  Let me ask you differently  If hiding isn't the answer  what if we did the opposite  What if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients  Last fall  I conducted a research study to find out what it is that people want to know about their healthcare. I didn't just want to study patients in a hospital  but everyday people. So my two medical students  Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns  literally took their research to the streets. They went to banks  coffee shops  senior centers  Chinese restaurants and train stations. What did they find  Well  when we asked people   What do you want to know about your healthcare   people responded with what they want to know about their doctors  because people understand health care to be the individual interaction between them and their doctors. When we asked   What do you want to know about your doctors   people gave three different answers. Some want to know that their doctor is competent and certified to practice medicine. Some want to be sure that their doctor is unbiased and is making decisions based on evidence and science  not on who pays them. Surprisingly to us  many people want to know something else about their doctors. Jonathan  a    year old law student  says he wants to find someone who is comfortable with LGBTQ patients and specializes in LGBT health. Serena  a    year old accountant  says that it's important to her for her doctor to share her values when it comes to reproductive choice and women's rights. Frank  a    year old hardware store owner  doesn't even like going to the doctor and wants to find someone who believes in prevention first  but who is comfortable with alternative treatments. One after another  our respondents told us that that doctor patient relationship is a deeply intimate one   that to show their doctors their bodies and tell them their deepest secrets  they want to first understand their doctor's values. Just because doctors have to see every patient doesn't mean that patients have to see every doctor. People want to know about their doctors first so that they can make an informed choice. As a result of this  I formed a campaign  Who's My Doctor  that calls for total transparency in medicine. Participating doctors voluntarily disclose on a public website not just information about where we went to medical school and what specialty we're in  but also our conflicts of interest. We go beyond the Government in the Sunshine Act about drug company affiliations  and we talk about how we're paid. Incentives matter. If you go to your doctor because of back pain  you might want to know he's getting paid       dollars to perform spine surgery versus    dollars to refer you to see a physical therapist  or if he's getting paid the same thing no matter what he recommends. Then  we go one step further. We add our values when it comes to women's health  LGBT health  alternative medicine  preventive health  and end of life decisions. We pledge to our patients that we are here to serve you  so you have a right to know who we are. We believe that transparency can be the cure for fear. I thought some doctors would sign on and others wouldn't  but I had no idea of the huge backlash that would ensue. Within one week of starting Who's My Doctor  Medscape's public forum and several online doctors' communities had thousands of posts about this topic. Here are a few. From a gastroenterologist in Portland   I devoted    years of my life to being a slave. I have loans and mortgages. I depend on lunches from drug companies to serve patients.  Well  times may be hard for everyone  but try telling your patient making        dollars a year to serve a family of four that you need the free lunch. From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte   I find it an invasion of my privacy to disclose where my income comes from. My patients don't disclose their incomes to me.  But your patients' sources of income don't affect your health. From a psychiatrist in New York City   Pretty soon we will have to disclose whether we prefer cats to dogs  what model of car we drive  and what toilet paper we use.  Well  how you feel about Toyotas or Cottonelle won't affect your patients' health  but your views on a woman's right to choose and preventive medicine and end of life decisions just might. And my favorite  from a Kansas City cardiologist   More government mandated stuff  Dr. Wen needs to move back to her own country.  Well  two pieces of good news. First of all  this is meant to be voluntary and not mandatory  and second of all  I'm American and I'm already here. Within a month  my employers were getting calls asking for me to be fired. I received mail at my undisclosed home address with threats to contact the medical board to sanction me. My friends and family urged me to quit this campaign. After the bomb threat  I was done. But then I heard from patients. Over social media  a TweetChat  which I'd learned what that was by then  generated  .  million impressions  and thousands of people wrote to encourage me to continue. They wrote with things like   If doctors are doing something they're that ashamed of  they shouldn't be doing it.   Elected officials have to disclose campaign contributions. Lawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests. Why shouldn't doctors   And finally  many people wrote and said   Let us patients decide what's important when we're choosing a doctor.  In our initial trial  over     doctors have taken the total transparency pledge. What a crazy new idea  right  But actually  this is not that new of a concept at all. Remember Dr. Sam  my doctor in China  with the goofy jokes and the wild hair  Well  she was my doctor  but she was also our neighbor who lived in the building across the street. I went to the same school as her daughter. My parents and I trusted her because we knew who she was and what she stood for  and she had no need to hide from us. Just one generation ago  this was the norm in the U.S. as well. You knew that your family doctor was the father of two teenage boys  that he quit smoking a few years ago  that he says he's a regular churchgoer  but you see him twice a year  once at Easter and once when his mother in law comes to town. You knew what he was about  and he had no need to hide from you. But the sickness of fear has taken over  and patients suffer the consequences. I know this firsthand. My mother fought her cancer for eight years. She was a planner  and she thought a lot about how she wanted to live and how she wanted to die. Not only did she sign advance directives  she wrote a    page document about how she had suffered enough  how it was time for her to go. One day  when I was a resident physician  I got a call to say that she was in the intensive care unit. By the time I got there  she was about to be intubated and put on a breathing machine.  But this is not what she wants   I said   and we have documents.  The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye  pointed at my then    year old sister  and said   Do you remember when you were that age  How would you have liked to grow up without your mother   Her oncologist was there too  and said   This is your mother. Can you really face yourself for the rest of your life if you don't do everything for her   I knew my mother so well. I understood what her directives meant so well  but I was a physician. That was the single hardest decision I ever made  to let her die in peace  and I carry those words of those doctors with me every single day. We can bridge the disconnect between what doctors do and what patients need. We can get there  because we've been there before  and we know that transparency gets us to that trust. Research has shown us that openness also helps doctors  that having open medical records  being willing to talk about medical errors  will increase patient trust  improve health outcomes  and reduce malpractice. That openness  that trust  is only going to be more important as we move from the infectious to the behavioral model of disease. Bacteria may not care so much about trust and intimacy  but for people to tackle the hard lifestyle choices  to address issues like smoking cessation  blood pressure management and diabetes control  well  that requires us to establish trust. Here's what other transparent doctors have said. Brandon Combs  an internist in Denver   This has brought me closer to my patients. The type of relationship I've developed   that's why I entered medicine.  Aaron Stupple  an internist in Denver   I tell my patients that I am totally open with them. I don't hide anything from them. This is me. Now tell me about you. We're in this together.  May Nguyen  a family physician in Houston   My colleagues are astounded by what I'm doing. They ask me how I could be so brave. I said  I'm not being brave  it's my job.  I leave you today with a final thought. Being totally transparent is scary. You feel naked  exposed and vulnerable  but that vulnerability  that humility  it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine. When doctors are willing to step off our pedestals  take off our white coats  and show our patients who we are and what medicine is all about  that's when we begin to overcome the sickness of fear. That's when we establish trust. That's when we change the paradigm of medicine from one of secrecy and hiding to one that is fully open and engaged for our patients. Thank you.\n",
      "So my freshman year of college I signed up for an internship in the housing unit at Greater Boston Legal Services. Showed up the first day ready to make coffee and photocopies  but was paired with this righteous  deeply inspired attorney named Jeff Purcell  who thrust me onto the front lines from the very first day. And over the course of nine months I had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low income families in Boston who would come in presenting with housing issues  but always had an underlying health issue. So I had a client who came in  about to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent. But he hasn't paid his rent  of course  because he's paying for his HIV medication and just can't afford both. We had moms who would come in  daughter has asthma  wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning. And one of our litigation strategies was actually to send me into the home of these clients with these large glass bottles. And I would collect the cockroaches  hot glue gun them to this poster board that we'd bring to court for our cases. And we always won because the judges were just so grossed out. Far more effective  I have to say  than anything I later learned in law school. But over the course of these nine months  I grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients    that by the time they came to us  they were already in crisis. And at the end of my freshman year of college  I read an article about the work that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing as Chair of Pediatrics at Boston Medical Center. And his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients. So I called Barry  and with his blessing  in October      walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center. I'll never forget  the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons. And the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two  three  sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable. The doctors  it seemed  never really had enough time for all the patients  try as they might. And over the course of six months  I would corner them in the hallway and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question   If you had unlimited resources  what's the one thing you would give your patients   And I heard the same story again and again  a story we've heard hundreds of times since then. They said   Every day we have patients that come into the clinic    child has an ear infection  I prescribe antibiotics. But the real issue is there's no food at home. The real issue is that child is living with    other people in a two bedroom apartment. And I don't even ask about those issues because there's nothing I can do. I have    minutes with each patient. Patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room. I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is. And I don't even have any help.  In that clinic  even today  there are two social workers for        pediatric patients  which is better than a lot of the clinics out there. So Health Leads was born of these conversations    a simple model where doctors and nurses can prescribe nutritious food  heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication. Patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well trained college student advocates who work side by side with these families to connect them out to the existing landscape of community resources. So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room    totally lemonade stand style. But today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly       patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy. So    months ago I got this email that changed my life. And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger  who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads and to share  as he said  a bit of historical context. In      Dr. Geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in this country  in a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta. And so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them. And they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket  which would fill them and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic. And when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington  D.C.    which was funding Geiger's clinic    found out about this  they were furious. And they sent this bureaucrat down to tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care    to which Geiger famously and logically responded   The last time I checked my textbooks  the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.  So when I got this email from Dr. Geiger  I knew I was supposed to be proud to be part of this history. But the truth is I was devastated. Here we are     years after Geiger has prescribed food for his patients  and I have doctors telling me   On those issues  we practice a 'don't ask  don't tell' policy.  Forty five years after Geiger  Health Leads has to reinvent the prescription for basic resources. So I have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day. How is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients  and especially low income patients  healthy  that we didn't use it  If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick care system  why don't we just do it  These questions  in my mind  are not hard because the answers are complicated  they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves. My belief is that it's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system  or even admit that we have any at all. Because if we did  they would be so removed from our current reality. But that doesn't change my belief that all of us  deep inside  here in this room and across this country  share a similar set of desires. That if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly  that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare  that it keep us healthy. This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one. And the way I think about this is that healthcare is like any other system. It's just a set of choices that people make. What if we decided to make a different set of choices  What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say   No. These things are ours. They will be used for our purposes. They will be used to realize our aspiration   What if everything we needed to realize our aspiration for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be claimed  So that's where Health Leads began. We started with the prescription pad    a very ordinary piece of paper    and we asked  not what do patients need to get healthy    antibiotics  an inhaler  medication    but what do patients need to be healthy  to not get sick in the first place  And we chose to use the prescription for that purpose. So just a few miles from here at Children's National Medical Center  when patients come into the doctor's office  they're asked a few questions. They're asked   Are you running out of food at the end of the month  Do you have safe housing   And when the doctor begins the visit  she knows height  weight  is there food at home  is the family living in a shelter. And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices  but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient  using Health Leads like any other sub specialty referral. The problem is  once you get a taste of what it's like to realize your aspiration for healthcare  you want more. So we thought  if we can get individual doctors to prescribe these basic resources for their patients  could we get an entire healthcare system to shift its presumption  And we gave it a shot. So now at Harlem Hospital Center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index  the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads. And our volunteers can then work with them to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs in their communities. We've created a presumption that if you're a patient at that hospital with an elevated BMI  the four walls of the doctor's office probably aren't going to give you everything you need to be healthy. You need more. So on the one hand  this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record. And on the other hand  it's a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool. In the private sector  when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed cost investment  it's called a billion dollar company. But in my world  it's called reduced obesity and diabetes. It's called healthcare    a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health  not just manage disease. Same thing in the clinic waiting room. So every day in this country three million patients pass through about         clinic waiting rooms in this country. And what do they do when they're there  They sit  they watch the goldfish in the fish tank  they read extremely old copies of Good Housekeeping magazine. But mostly we all just sit there forever  waiting. How did we get here where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours to waiting  What if we had a waiting room where you don't just sit when you're sick  but where you go to get healthy. If airports can become shopping malls and McDonald's can become playgrounds  surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room. And that's what Health Leads has tried to do  to reclaim that real estate and that time and to use it as a gateway to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy. So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast  your kid has asthma  your heat just got turned off  and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER  because the cold air triggered your child's asthma. But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously  the waiting room became the place where Health Leads turned your heat back on  And of course all of this requires a broader workforce. But if we're creative  we already have that too. We know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers aren't enough  that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining. Health just takes more time. It requires a non clinical army of community health workers and case managers and many others. What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the    million college students in this country  Unencumbered by clinical responsibilities  unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients  and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using Google. Now lest you think it improbable that a college volunteer can make this kind of commitment  I have two words for you  March Madness. The average NCAA Division I men's basketball player dedicates    hours a week to his sport. Now we may think that's good or bad  but in either case it's real. And Health Leads is based on the presumption that for too long we have asked too little of our college students when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities. College sports teams say   We're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we're going to measure your performance  and your team's performance  and if you don't measure up or you don't show up  we're going to cut you off the team. But we'll make huge investments in your training and development  and we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers.  And people line up out the door just for the chance to be part of it. So our feeling is  if it's good enough for the rugby team  it's good enough for health and poverty. Health Leads too recruits competitively  trains intensively  coaches professionally  demands significant time  builds a cohesive team and measures results    a kind of Teach for America for healthcare. Now in the top    cities in the U.S. with the largest number of Medicaid patients  each of those has at least        college students. New York alone has half a million college students. And this isn't just a sort of short term workforce to connect patients to basic resources  it's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who've spent two  three  four years in the clinic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs. And they leave with the conviction  the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic aspirations for health care. And the thing is  there's thousands of these folks already out there. So Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine at UCSF Medical Center  but for three years as an undergraduate she was a Health Leads volunteer in the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center. Mia says   When my classmates write a prescription  they think their work is done. When I write a prescription  I think  can the family read the prescription  Do they have transportation to the pharmacy  Do they have food to take with the prescription  Do they have insurance to fill the prescription  Those are the questions I learned at Health Leads  not in medical school.  Now none of these solutions    the prescription pad  the electronic medical record  the waiting room  the army of college students    are perfect. But they are ours for the taking    simple examples of the vast under utilized healthcare resources that  if we reclaimed and redeployed  could realize our most basic aspiration of healthcare. So I had been at Legal Services for about nine months when this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind. And I knew I had to tell Jeff Purcell  my attorney  that I needed to leave. And I was so nervous  because I thought he was going to be disappointed in me for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea. And I sat down with him and I said   Jeff  I have this idea that we could mobilize college students to address patients' most basic health needs.  And I'll be honest  all I wanted was for him to not be angry at me. But he said this   Rebecca  when you have a vision  you have an obligation to realize that vision. You must pursue that vision.  And I have to say  I was like  Whoa. That's a lot of pressure.  I just wanted a blessing  I didn't want some kind of mandate. But the truth is I've spent every waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision. I believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country. I believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare  it will not be by the diseases cured  but by the diseases prevented. It will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists  but by how rarely we needed them. And most of all  I believe that when we measure healthcare  it will be  not by what the system was  but by what we chose it to be. Thank you. Thank you.\n",
      "I want to share some personal friends and stories with you that I've actually never talked about in public before to help illustrate the idea and the need and the hope for us to reinvent our health care system around the world. Twenty four years ago  I had    a sophomore in college  I had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved. And I ended up in student health  and they ran some labwork and came back right away  and said   Kidney problems.  And before I knew it  I was involved and thrown into this six months of tests and trials and tribulations with six doctors across two hospitals in this clash of medical titans to figure out which one of them was right about what was wrong with me. And I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound  and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once  and I'm like   Uh oh  this is bad news.  And their diagnosis was this  They said   You have two rare kidney diseases that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually  you have cancer like cells in your immune system that we need to start treatment right away  and you'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant  and you're not likely to live more than two or three years.  Now  with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis  it just sucked me in immediately  as if I began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me  until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room  who became a dear friend  and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases  and said   Eric  these people who get this are normally in their '  s and '  s. They don't know anything about you. Wake up. Take control of your health and get on with your life.  And I did. Now  these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people. In fact  these professionals were miracle workers  but they're working in a flawed  expensive system that's set up the wrong way. It's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need. It's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us. It's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails  and so something either works or you die. And it's dependent on passive patients who just take it and don't ask any questions. Now the problem with this model is that it's unsustainable globally. It's unaffordable globally. We need to invent what I call a personal health system. So what does this personal health system look like  and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail  Now  I'm going to start by actually sharing with you a new friend of mine  Libby  somebody I've become quite attached to over the last six months. This is Libby  or actually  this is an ultrasound image of Libby. This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have. Now  this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today  and you'll notice  on the edge of this image  there's some dark spots there  which was really concerning to me. So we're going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how Libby's doing. This is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here. Don't you in the front row worry or anything. I'm going to use a device from a company called Mobisante. This is a portable ultrasound. It can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet. Mobisante is up in Redmond  Washington  and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself. They're not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this. This is a concept demo  so I want to make that clear. All right  I gotta gel up. Now the people in the front row are very nervous.  Laughter  And I want to actually introduce you to Dr. Batiuk  who's another friend of mine. He's up in Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland  Oregon. So let me just make sure. Hey  Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay  And actually  can you see Libby  Thomas Batuik  Hi there  Eric. You look busy. How are you  Eric Dishman  I'm good. I'm just taking my clothes off in front of a few hundred people. It's wonderful. So I just wanted to see  is this the image you need to get  And I know you want to look and see if those spots are still there. TB  Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here  give me a lay of the land. ED  All right.TB  Okay. Turn it a little bit inside  a little bit toward the middle for me. Okay  that's good. How about up a little bit  Okay  freeze that image. That's a good one for me. ED  All right. Now last week  when I did this  you had me measure that spot to the right. Should I do that again  TB  Yeah  let's do that. ED  All right. This is kind of hard to do with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring  but I've got it  I think  and I'll save that image and send it to you. So tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means. It's not something I was very happy about. TB  Many people after a kidney transplant will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney. Most of the time it doesn't create any kind of mischief  but it does warrant looking at  so I'm happy we've got an opportunity to look at it today  make sure that it's not growing  it's not creating any problems. Based on the other images we have  I'm really happy how it looks today. ED  All right. Well  I guess we'll double check it when I come in. I've got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks  and I'm going to let you do that in the clinic  because I don't think I can do that one on myself. TB  Good choice.ED  All right  thanks  Dr. Batiuk. All right. So what you're sort of seeing here is an example of disruptive technologies  of mobile  social and analytic technologies. These are the foundations of what's going to make personal health possible. Now there's really three pillars of this personal health I want to talk to you about now  and it's care anywhere  care networking and care customization. And you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with Dr. Batiuk. So let's start with care anywhere. Humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics in the     s. It is time to update our thinking. We have got to untether clinicians and patients from the notion of traveling to a special bricks and mortar place for all of our care  because these places are often the wrong tool  and the most expensive tool  for the job. And these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients  especially in an era of superbugs and hospital acquired infections. And many countries are going to go brickless from the start because they're never going to be able to afford the mega medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built. Now I personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age. This was me in third grade. I broke my elbow very seriously  had to have surgery  worried that they were going to actually lose the arm. Recovering from the surgery in the hospital  I get bedsores. Those bedsores become infected  and they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to  and now my whole body breaks out  and now all of those become infected. The longer I stayed in the hospital  the sicker I became  and the more expensive it became  and this happens to millions of people around the world every year. The future of personal health that I'm talking about says care must occur at home as the default model  not in a hospital or clinic. You have to earn your way into those places by being sick enough to use that tool for the job. Now the smartphones that we're already carrying can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them  and a whole array of others  today  and as sensing is built into these  we'll be able to do vital signs monitor and behavioral monitoring like we've never had before. Many of us will have implantables that will actually look real time at what's going on with our blood chemistry and in our proteins right now. Now the software is also getting smarter  right  Think about a coach  an agent online  that's going to help me do safe self care. That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound will likely have real time image processing  and the device will say   Up  down  left  right  ah  Eric  that's the perfect spot to send that image off to your doctor.  Now  if we've got all these networked devices that are helping us to do care anywhere  it stands to reason that we also need a team to be able to interact with all of that stuff  and that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about  care networking. We have got to go beyond this paradigm of isolated specialists doing parts care to multidisciplinary teams doing person care. Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best  and it is deadly at worst. Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members. I had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school  when we're under treatment for the kidney  and suddenly  they're like   Oh  we think you have a heart problem.  And I have these palpitations that are showing up. They put me through five weeks of tests    very expensive  very scary    before the nurse finally notices the piece of the paper  my meds list that I've been carrying to every single appointment  and says   Oh my gosh.  Three different specialists had prescribed three different versions of the same drug to me. I did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem. I had a care coordination problem. And this happens to millions of people every year. I want to use technology that we're all working on and making happen to make health care a coordinated team sport. Now this is the most frightening thing to me. Out of all the care I've had in hospitals and clinics around the world  the first time I've ever had a true team based care experience was at Legacy Good Sam these last six months for me to go get this. And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy. There's a couple of the folks here. You'll recognize Dr. Batiuk. We just talked to him. Here's Jenny  one of the nurses  Allison  who helped manage the transplant list  and a dozen other people who aren't pictured  a pharmacist  a psychologist  a nutritionist  even a financial counselor  Lisa  who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles. I wept the day I graduated. I should have been happy  because I was so well that I could go back to my normal doctors  but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team. And here's the most important part. The other people in this picture are me and my wife  Ashley. Legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics. That's the only way that the model works. My team is actually working in China on one of these self care models for a project we called Age Friendly Cities. We're trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors caring for themselves as well as the care provided by their family members or volunteer community health workers  as well as have an exchange network online  where  for example  I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom  if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals  and we exchange all of that online. The most important point I want to make to you about this is the sacred and somewhat over romanticized doctor patient one on one is a relic of the past. The future of health care is smart teams  and you'd better be on that team for yourself. Now  the last thing that I want to talk to you about is care customization  because if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking  those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system  but there's still too much guesswork. Randomized clinical trials were actually invented in      to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis  and those are important things  don't get me wrong. These population studies that we've done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives  but the problem is that health care is treating us as averages  not unique individuals  because at the end of the day  the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied. That's what's leading to the guesswork. The technologies that are coming  high performance computing  analytics  big data that everyone's talking about  will allow us to build predictive models for each of us as individual patients. And the magic here is  experiment on my avatar in software  not my body in suffering. Now  I've had two examples I want to quickly share with you of this kind of care customization on my own journey. The first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity. It's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live. I was optimizing my life for quality of life  and quality of life for me means time in snow. So on my chart  I forced them to put   Patient goal  low doses of drugs over longer periods of time  side effects friendly to skiing.  And I think that's why I achieved longevity. I think that time in snow therapy was as important as the pharmaceuticals that I had. Now the second example of customization    and by the way  you can't customize care if you don't know your own goals  so health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals. But the second example I want to give you is  I happened to be an early guinea pig  and I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced. Now it took about two weeks of processing on Intel's highest end servers to make this happen  and another six months of human and computing labor to make sense of all of that data. And at the end of all of that  they said   Yes  those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans all of those years ago were wrong  and we have a better path forward.  The future that Intel's working on now is to figure out how to make that computing for personalized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours  and make this kind of tool available  not just in the mainframes of tier one research hospitals around the world  but in the mainstream    every patient  every clinic with access to whole genome sequencing. And I tell you  this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime. So these three pillars of personal health  care anywhere  care networking  care customization  are happening in pieces now  but this vision will completely fail if we don't step up as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles. It's what my friend Verna said  Wake up and take control of your health. Because at the end of the day these technologies are simply about people caring for other people and ourselves in some powerful new ways. And it's in that spirit that I want to introduce you to one last friend  very quickly. Tracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney that I was never supposed to have. So Tracey  just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you. Tracey Gamley  For me  it was really easy. I only had one night in the hospital. The surgery was done laparoscopically  so I have just five very small scars on my abdomen  and I had four weeks away from work and went back to doing everything I'd done before without any changes. ED  Well  I probably will never get a chance to say this to you in such a large audience ever again. So  thank you  feel likes a really trite word  but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life. This TED stage and all of the TED stages are often about celebrating innovation and celebrating new technologies  and I've done that here today  and I've seen amazing things coming from TED speakers  I mean  my gosh  artificial kidneys  even printable kidneys  that are coming. But until such time that these amazing technologies are available to all of us  and even when they are  it's up to us to care for  and even save  one another. I hope you will go out and make personal health happen for yourselves and for everyone. Thanks so much.\n",
      "Five years ago  I was on a sabbatical  and I returned to the medical university where I studied. I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in    years  in fact since I became a management consultant. There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent. The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost cutting  and the second thing  which really bothered me  actually  was that several of the colleagues I met  former friends from medical school  who I knew to be some of the smartest  most motivated  engaged and passionate people I'd ever met  many of them had turned cynical  disengaged  or had distanced themselves from hospital management. So with this focus on cost cutting  I asked myself  are we forgetting the patient  Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare. It's a big part of the national budgets. And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth. In some countries  we have long waiting times for patients for surgery. In other countries  new drugs are not being reimbursed  and therefore don't reach patients. In several countries  doctors and nurses are the targets  to some extent  for the governments. After all  the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses. You choose an expensive lab test  you choose to operate on an old and frail patient. So  by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians  this is a way to hold costs down. And ultimately  some physicians will say today that they don't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients. So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated. At BCG  we looked at this  and we asked ourselves  this can't be the right way of managing healthcare. And so we took a step back and we said   What is it that we are trying to achieve   Ultimately  in the healthcare system  we're aiming at improving health for the patients  and we need to do so at a limited  or affordable  cost. We call this value based healthcare. On the screen behind me  you see what we mean by value  outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend. This was described beautifully in a book in      by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg. On this picture  you have my father in law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters. When we started doing our research at BCG  we decided not to look so much at the costs  but to look at the quality instead  and in the research  one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw. You compare hospitals in a country  you'll find some that are extremely good  but you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse. The differences were dramatic. Erik  my father in law  he suffers from prostate cancer  and he probably needs surgery. Now living in Europe  he can choose to go to Germany that has a well reputed healthcare system. If he goes there and goes to the average hospital  he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about    percent  so he would have to start wearing diapers again. You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot. If he instead would go to Hamburg  and to a clinic called the Martini Klinik  the risk would be only one in   . Either you a flip a coin  or you have a one in    risk. That's a huge difference  a seven fold difference. When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases  we see these huge differences. But you and I don't know. We don't have the data. And often  the data actually doesn't exist. Nobody knows. So going the hospital is a lottery. Now  it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope. In the late '  s  there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting  and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery. To the left of this slide  you see a variety of metal pieces  artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip. They all realized they had their individual way of operating. They all argued that   My technique is the best   but none of them actually knew  and they admitted that. So they said   We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what's best.  So they in fact spent two years debating   So what is quality in hip surgery    Oh  we should measure this.   No  we should measure that.  And they finally agreed. And once they had agreed  they started measuring  and started sharing the data. Very quickly  they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in  it actually lasted a lot longer  and most patients would never have to be re operated on in their lifetime. They published the data  and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country. Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense. Since then  they publish every year. Once a year  they publish the league table  who's best  who's at the bottom  And they visit each other to try to learn  so a continuous cycle of improvement. For many years  Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world  at least for those who actually were measuring  and many were not. Now I found this principle really exciting. So the physicians get together  they agree on what quality is  they start measuring  they share the data  they find who's best  and they learn from it. Continuous improvement. Now  that's not the only exciting part. That's exciting in itself. But if you bring back the cost side of the equation  and look at that  it turns out  those who have focused on quality  they actually also have the lowest costs  although that's not been the purpose in the first place. So if you look at the hip surgery story again  there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden. They looked at how many patients have needed to be re operated on seven years after the first surgery. In the United States  the number was three times higher than in Sweden. So many unnecessary surgeries  and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period. Now  you can imagine how much savings there would be for society. We did a study where we looked at OECD data. OECD does  every so often  look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries. The United States has  for many diseases  actually a quality which is below the average in OECD. Now  if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality  and raise quality just to the level of average OECD  it would save the American people     billion U.S. dollars a year. That's    percent of the budget  of the healthcare budget of the country. Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic  and it's all logical  but is it possible  This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare  and I would argue that not only can it be done  but it has to be done. The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system. In my practice as a consultant  I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year. The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients. Physicians are  like most of you in the audience  very competitive. They were always best in class. We were always best in class. And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do  they will do whatever it takes to improve. But most of them don't know. But physicians have another characteristic. They actually thrive from peer recognition. If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results  they will share. They will share the information on how to improve. So it is  by measuring and creating transparency  you get a cycle of continuous improvement  which is what this slide shows. Now  you may say this is a nice idea  but this isn't only an idea. This is happening in reality. We're creating a global community  and a large global community  where we'll be able to measure and compare what we achieve. Together with two academic institutions  Michael Porter at Harvard Business School  and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden  BCG has formed something we call ICHOM. You may think that's a sneeze  but it's not a sneeze  it's an acronym. It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement. We're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss  disease by disease  what is really quality  what should we measure  and to make those standards global. They've worked    four working groups have worked during the past year  cataracts  back pain  coronary artery disease  which is  for instance  heart attack  and prostate cancer. The four groups will publish their data in November of this year. That's the first time we'll be comparing apples to apples  not only within a country  but between countries. Next year  we're planning to do eight diseases  the year after    . In three years' time  we plan to have covered    percent of the disease burden. Compare apples to apples. Who's better  Why is that  Five months ago  I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe. They have a new CEO  and she has a vision  I want to manage my big institution much more on quality  outcomes that matter to patients. This particular day  we sat in a workshop together with physicians  nurses and other staff  discussing leukemia in children. The group discussed  how do we measure quality today  Can we measure it better than we do  We discussed  how do we treat these kids  what are important improvements  And we discussed what are the costs for these patients  can we do treatment more efficiently  There was an enormous energy in the room. There were so many ideas  so much enthusiasm. At the end of the meeting  the chairman of the department  he stood up. He looked over the group and he said    first he raised his hand  I forgot that    he raised his hand  clenched his fist  and then he said to the group   Thank you. Thank you. Today  we're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way.  By measuring value in healthcare  that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients  we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution. I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution  and I'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine  the Greek Hippocrates  who always put the patient at the center  he would smile in his grave. Thank you.\n",

      "Come with me to the bottom of the world  Antarctica  the highest  driest  windiest  and yes  coldest region on Earth    more arid than the Sahara and  in parts  colder than Mars. The ice of Antarctica glows with a light so dazzling  it blinds the unprotected eye. Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it. The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level  beneath its weight. Yet  the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change. It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages. Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record. And here  scientists are drilling into the past of our planet to find clues to the future of climate change. This past January  I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide  about     miles from the South Pole. It is the best place on the planet  many say  to study the history of climate change. There  about    scientists from the University of Wisconsin  the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others have been working to answer a central question about global warming. What is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures  It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising. This past May was the warmest worldwide on record. And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too. What we don't know is the exact  precise  immediate impact of these changes on natural climate patterns    winds  ocean currents  precipitation rates  cloud formation  things that bear on the health and well being of billions of people. Their entire camp  every item of gear  was ferried     miles from McMurdo Station  the main U.S. supply base on the coast of Antarctica. WAIS Divide itself though  is a circle of tents in the snow. In blizzard winds  the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse. It snows so heavily there  the installation was almost immediately buried. Indeed  the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here    times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica. They have to dig themselves out every day. It makes for an exotic and chilly commute. But under the surface is a hive of industrial activity centered around an eight million dollar drill assembly. Periodically  this drill  like a biopsy needle  plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis. Ten times a day  they extract the    foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow  season after season for thousands of years. It's really a time machine. At the peak of activity earlier this year  the researchers lowered the drill an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day and another     years deeper into the past. Periodically  they remove a cylinder of ice  like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell from the barrel of a drill. They inspect it  they check it for cracks  for drill damage  for spalls  for chips. More importantly  they prepare it for inspection and analysis by    independent laboratories in the United States and Europe  who will examine it for    different trace chemicals related to climate  some in parts per quadrillion. Yes  I said that with a Q  quadrillion. They cut the cylinders up into three foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs  some       miles from the drill site. Each cylinder is a parfait of time. This ice formed as snow        years ago  when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet. Bathed in polarized light and cut in cross section  this ancient ice reveals itself as a mosaic of colors  each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice have affected this material at depths where pressures can reach a ton per square inch. Every year  it begins with a snowflake  and by digging into fresh snow  we can see how this process is ongoing today. This wall of undisturbed snow  back lit by sunlight  shows the striations of winter and summer snow  layer upon layer. Each storm scours the atmosphere  washing out dust  soot  trace chemicals  and depositing them on the snow pack year after year  millennia after millennia  creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than        feet thick. From this  we can detect an extraordinary number of things. We can see the calcium from the world's deserts  soot from distant wildfires  methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon  all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes to this remote and very cold place. Most importantly  these cylinders and this snow trap air. Each cylinder is about    percent ancient air  a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases    carbon dioxide  methane  nitrous oxide    all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell. And this is the object of their scrutiny. But don't we already know what we need to know about greenhouse gases  Why do we need to study this anymore  Don't we already know how they affect temperatures  Don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization  The truth is  we only know the outlines  and what we don't completely understand  we can't properly fix. Indeed  we run the risk of making things worse. Consider  the single most successful international environmental effort of the   th century  the Montreal Protocol  in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet from the harmful effects of ozone destroying chemicals used at that time in air conditioners  refrigerators and other cooling devices. We banned those chemicals  and we replaced them  unknowingly  with other substances that  molecule per molecule  are a hundred times more potent as heat trapping  greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. This process requires extraordinary precautions. The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated. Moreover  in this       mile journey  they have to insure this ice doesn't melt. Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics. They have to  in fact  make sure this ice never gets warmer than about    degrees below zero  otherwise  the key gases inside it will dissipate. So  in the coldest place on Earth  they work inside a refrigerator. As they handle the ice  in fact  they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven  so that  when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen  they can don a fresh pair. They work against the clock and against the thermometer. So far  they've packed up about       feet of ice cores for shipment back to the United States. This past season  they manhandled them across the ice to waiting aircraft. The    th Air National Guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of Antarctica  where it was boarded onto a freighter  shipped across the tropics to California  unloaded  put on a truck  driven across the desert to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver  Colorado  where  as we speak  scientists are now slicing this material up for samples  for analysis  to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in Europe. Antarctica was this planet's last empty quarter    the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world. Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map  and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended. Here  the ice seems a living presence. The wind that rubs against it gives it voice. It is a voice of experience. It is a voice we should heed. Thank you.\n",
      "Let's go south. All of you are actually going south. This is the direction of south  this way  and if you go       kilometers out of the back of this room  you will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on Earth  the Pole itself. Now  I am not an explorer. I'm not an environmentalist. I'm actually just a survivor  and these photographs that I'm showing you here are dangerous. They are the ice melt of the South and North Poles. And ladies and gentlemen  we need to listen to what these places are telling us  and if we don't  we will end up with our own survival situation here on planet Earth. I have faced head on these places  and to walk across a melting ocean of ice is without doubt the most frightening thing that's ever happened to me. Antarctica is such a hopeful place. It is protected by  the Antarctic Treaty  signed in     . In       a    year agreement was entered into that stops any exploitation in Antarctica  and this agreement could be altered  changed  modified  or even abandoned starting in the year     . Ladies and gentlemen  people already far up north from here in the Arctic are already taking advantage of this ice melt  taking out resources from areas already that have been covered in ice for the last                         years. Can they not join the dots and think   Why is the ice actually melting   This is such an amazing place  the Antarctic  and I have worked hard for the last    years on this mission to make sure that what's happening up here in the North does never happen   cannot happen in the South. Where did this all begin  It began for me at the age of   . Check out that haircut.  It's a bit odd.  Laughter  And at the age of      I was inspired by the real explorers to want to try to be the first to walk to both Poles. I found it incredibly inspiring that the idea of becoming a polar traveler went down pretty well with girls  at parties when I was at university. That was a bit more inspiring. And after years  seven years of fundraising  seven years of being told no  seven years of being told by my family to seek counseling and psychiatric help  eventually three of us found ourselves marching to the South Geographic Pole on the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on Earth in history. In this photograph  we are standing in an area the size of the United States of America  and we're on our own. We have no radio  communications  no backup. Beneath our feet     percent of all the world's ice     percent of all the world's fresh water. We're standing on it. This is the power of Antarctica. On this journey  we faced the danger of crevasses  intense cold  so cold that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing  your teeth can crack  water can freeze in your eyes. Let's just say it's a bit chilly.  Laughter  And after    desperate days  we arrive at the South Pole. We had done it. But something happened to me on that    day journey in      that brought me here  and it hurt. My eyes changed color in    days through damage. Our faces blistered out. The skin ripped off and we wondered why. And when we got home  we were told by NASA that a hole in the ozone had been discovered above the South Pole  and we'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered. Ultraviolet rays down  hit the ice  bounced back  fried out the eyes  ripped off our faces. It was a bit of a shock     Laughter     and it started me thinking. In       we now head north. Sixty days  every step away from the safety of land across a frozen ocean. It was desperately cold again. Here's me coming in from washing naked at     Celsius. And if anybody ever says to you   I am cold      Laughter     if they look like this   they are cold  definitely. And       kilometers away from the safety of land  disaster strikes. The Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet four months before it ever had in history  and we're       kilometers from safety. The ice is crashing around us  grinding  and I'm thinking   Are we going to die   But something clicked in my head on this day  as I realized we  as a world  are in a survival situation  and that feeling has never gone away for    long years. Back then  we had to march or die. And we're not some TV survivor program. When things go wrong for us  it's life or death  and our brave African American Daryl  who would become the first American to walk to the North Pole  his heel dropped off  from frostbite     klicks out. He must keep going  he does  and after    days on the ice  we stood at the North Pole. We had done it. Yes  I became the first person in history stupid enough to walk to both Poles  but it was our success. And sadly  on return home  it was not all fun. I became very low. To succeed at something is often harder than actually making it happen. I was empty  lonely  financially destroyed. I was without hope  but hope came in the form of the great Jacques Cousteau  and he inspired me to take on  the      mission. Being Jacques  he gave me clear instructions  Engage the world leaders  talk to industry and business  and above all  Rob  inspire young people  because they will choose the future of the preservation of Antarctica. For the world leaders  we've been to every world Earth Summit  all three of them  with our brave yacht        twice to Rio  once in '    once in       and for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg  we made the longest overland voyage ever made with a yacht         kilometers around the whole of Southern Africa doing our best to inspire over a million young people in person about      and about their environment. For the last    years  we have taken over       people  people from industry and business  women and men from companies  students from all over the world  down to Antarctica  and during those missions  we've managed to pull out over       tons of twisted metal left in Antarctica. That took eight years  and I'm so proud of it because we recycled all of it  back here in South America. I have been inspired ever since I could walk to recycle by my mum. Here she is  and my mum    my mum is still recycling  and as she is in her    th year  isn't that fantastic  And when    I love my mum. But when Mum was born  the population of our planet was only  .  billion people  and talking in terms of billions  we have taken young people from industry and business from India  from China. These are game changing nations  and will be hugely important in the decision about the preservation of the Antarctic. Unbelievably  we've engaged and inspired women to come from the Middle East  often for the first time they've  represented their nations in Antarctica. Fantastic people  so inspired. To look after Antarctica  you've got to first engage people with this extraordinary place  form a relationship  form a bond  form some love. It is such a privilege to go to Antarctica  I can't tell you. I feel so lucky  and I've been    times in my life  and all those people who come with us return home as great champions  not only for Antarctica  but for local issues back in their own nations. Let's go back to where we began  the ice melt of the North and South Poles. And it's not good news. NASA informed us six months ago that the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf is now disintegrating. Huge areas of ice    look how big Antarctica is even compared to here    Huge areas of ice  are breaking off from Antarctica  the size of small nations. And NASA have calculated that the sea level will rise  it is definite  by one meter in the next     years  the same time that my mum has been on planet Earth. It's going to happen  and I've realized that  the preservation of Antarctica and our survival here on Earth are linked. And there is a very simple solution. If we are using more renewable energy in the real world  if we are being more efficient with the energy here  running our energy mix in a cleaner way  there will be no financial reason to go and exploit Antarctica. It won't make financial sense  and if we manage our energy better  we also may be able to slow down  maybe even stop  this great ice melt that threatens us. It's a big challenge  and what is our response to it  We've got to go back one last time  and at the end of next year  we will go back to the South Geographic Pole  where we arrived    years ago on foot  and retrace our steps of       kilometers  but this time only using renewable energy to survive. We will walk across those icecaps  which far down below are melting  hopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue. This is my son  Barney. He is coming with me. He is committed to walking side by side with his father  and what he will do is to translate these messages and inspire these messages to the minds of future young leaders. I'm extremely proud of him. Good on him  Barney. Ladies and gentlemen   a survivor    and I'm good    a survivor sees a problem and doesn't go   Whatever.  A survivor sees a problem and deals with that problem before it becomes a threat. We have    years to preserve the Antarctic. We all own it. We all have responsibility. The fact that nobody owns it  maybe means that we can succeed. Antarctica is a moral line in the snow  and on one side of that line we should fight  fight hard for this one beautiful  pristine place left alone on Earth. I know it's possible. We are going to do it. And I'll leave you with these words from Goethe. I've tried to live by them.  If you can do  or dream you can  begin it now  for boldness has genius  power and magic in it.  Good luck to you all. Thank you very much.\n",
      "This is me. My name is Ben Saunders. I specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places. On May   th last year  I stood alone at the North geographic Pole. I was the only human being in an area one and a half times the size of America  five and a half thousand square miles. More than       people have climbed Everest.    people have stood on the moon. Including me  only four people have skied solo to the North Pole. And I think the reason for that       thank you    I think the reason for that is that it's    it's    well  it's as Chris said  bonkers. It's a journey that is right at the limit of human capability. I skied the equivalent of    marathons back to back.     miles in    weeks. And I was dragging all the food I needed  the supplies  the equipment  sleeping bag  one change of underwear    everything I needed for nearly three months. What we're going to try and do today  in the    and a bit minutes I've got left  is to try and answer three questions. The first one is  why  The second one is  how do you go to the loo at minus      Ben  I've read somewhere that at minus     exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute  so how do you answer the call of nature   I don't want to answer these now. I'll come on to them at the end. Third one  how do you top that  What's next  It all started back in     . My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow    enormously experienced chap. This was like my polar apprenticeship. We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here  Severnaya Zemlya  to the North Pole. And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole  geographic North Pole  is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea. This is about as good as maps get  and to reach it you've got to ski literally over the frozen crust  the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean. I'd spoken to all the experts. I'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts. But I realized on the morning of day one that I had no idea exactly what I'd let myself in for. I was    years old. No one my age had attempted anything like this  and pretty quickly  almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong. We were attacked by a polar bear on day two. I had frostbite in my left big toe. We started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry  losing lots of weight. Some very unusual weather conditions  very difficult ice conditions. We had decidedly low tech communications. We couldn't afford a satellite phone  so we had HF radio. You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent. There's a wire dangling down either side. That was our HF radio antenna. We had less than two hours two way communication with the outside world in two months. Ultimately  we ran out of time. We'd skied     miles. We were just over     miles left to go to the Pole  and we'd run out of time. We were too late into the summer  the ice was starting to melt  we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio  and they said   Look boys  you've run out of time. We've got to pick you up.  And I felt that I had failed  wholeheartedly. I was a failure. The one goal  the one dream I'd had for as long as I could remember    I hadn't even come close. And skiing along that first trip  I had two imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough  just to keep my motivation going. The first one was reaching the Pole itself. I could see vividly  I suppose  being filmed out of the door of a helicopter  there was  kind of  rock music playing in the background  and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack  you know  flying in the wind. I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole  you know    ah  glorious moment    the music kind of reaching a crescendo. The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport  and I could see again  vividly  the camera flashbulbs going off  the paparazzi  the autograph hunters  the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal. And of course  neither of these things happened. We didn't get to the Pole  and we didn't have any money to pay anyone to do the PR  so no one had heard of this expedition. And I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there  my brother was there  my granddad was there    had a little Union Jack       and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum. I was physically exhausted  mentally an absolute wreck  considered myself a failure. In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition  and lying on my mum's sofa  day in day out  watching daytime TV. My brother sent me a text message  an SMS    it was a quote from the  Simpsons.  It said   You tried your hardest and failed miserably. The lesson is  don't even try.  Fast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa  and start planning another expedition. This time  I wanted to go right across  on my own this time  from Russia  at the top of the map  to the North Pole  where the sort of kink in the middle is  and then on to Canada. No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own. Two Norwegians did it as a team in     . No one's done it solo. Very famous  very accomplished Italian mountaineer  Reinhold Messner  tried it in       and he was rescued after a week. He described this expedition as    times as dangerous as Everest. So for some reason  this was what I wanted to have a crack at  but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece  let alone make it across to Canada  I had to take a radical approach. This meant everything from perfecting the sawn off  sub two gram toothbrush  to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists in developing a completely new  revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch        calories a day. And the expedition started in February last year. Big support team. We had a film crew  a couple of logistics people with us  my girlfriend  a photographer. At first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow. The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk  on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir  spelled K R A S. The next bit  we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga  which was the sort of last bit of civilization. Our cameraman  who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times  actually asked the pilot  before we got on the plane  how long this flight would take  and the pilot    Russian pilot    completely deadpan  replied   Six hours    if we live.  We got to Khatanga. I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world  but you can see it from there. It was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for    days. There was a kind of vodka fueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter  so we were stuck. We couldn't move. Finally  morning of day     we got the all clear  loaded up the helicopters    two helicopters flying in tandem    dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice. We had a frantic sort of    minutes of filming  photography  while the helicopter was still there  I did an interview on the satellite phone  and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter  wham  the door closed  and I was alone. And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice. All I could think about was running back up to the door  banging on the door  and saying   Look guys  I haven't quite thought this through.  To make things worse  you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen  that's a full moon. Because we'd been held up in Russia  of course  the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides  when you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea  high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen    the ice is going to start moving around a bit. I was  you can see there  pulling two sledges. Grand total in all     days of food and fuel      kilos    that's almost exactly     pounds. When the ice was flat or flattish  I could just about pull both. When the ice wasn't flat  I didn't have a hope in hell. I had to pull one  leave it  and go back and get the other one. Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice    the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean  the wind and the tides. NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began. And it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting. I was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the    weeks I was alone last year  and I was drifting backwards most of the time. My record was minus  .  miles. I got up in the morning  took the tent down  skied north for seven and a half hours  put the tent up  and I was two and a half miles further back than when I'd started. I literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice. I'm lying in the tent  getting ready to go. The weather is just appalling    oh  drifted back about five miles in the last    last night. Later in the expedition  the problem was no longer the ice. It was a lack of ice    open water. I knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming. I knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve. This was my little bit of bio mimicry. Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines. If they come to water  they'll climb in  swim across it. So we had a dry suit developed    I worked with a team in Norway    based on a sort of survival suit    I suppose  that helicopter pilots would wear    that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots  over my mittens  it would pull up around my face   and seal pretty tightly around my face. And this meant I could ski over very thin ice  and if I fell through  it wasn't the end of the world. It also meant  if the worst came to the worst  I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me. Some pretty radical technology  a radical approach   but it worked perfectly. Another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology. In       Shackleton's Endurance expedition    there was    one of his crew  a guy called Thomas Orde Lees. He said   The explorers of       if there is anything left to explore  will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes.  Well  Orde Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone  Iridium satellite phone. The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket. And every single day of the    days I was alone on the ice  I was blogging live from my tent  sending back a little diary piece  sending back information on the distance I'd covered    the ice conditions  the temperature    and a daily photo. Remember        we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world. Last year  blogging live from an expedition that's been described as    times as dangerous as Everest. It wasn't all high tech. This is navigating in what's called a whiteout. When you get lots of mist  low cloud  the wind starts blowing the snow up. You can't see an awful lot. You can just see  there's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles. I'd navigate using the direction of the wind. So  kind of a weird combination of high tech and low tech. I got to the Pole on the   th of May. It took me    days to get there from Russia  and there is nothing there. There isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there  purely because it's sea ice. It's drifting. Stick a flag there  leave it there  pretty soon it will drift off  usually towards Canada or Greenland. I knew this  but I was expecting something. Strange mixture of feelings  it was extremely warm by this stage  a lot of open water around  and of course  elated that I'd got there under my own steam  but starting to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada  which was still     miles away  were slim at best. The only proof I've got that I was there is a blurry photo of my GPS  the little satellite navigation gadget. You can just see    there's a nine and a string of zeros here. Ninety degrees north    that is slap bang in the North Pole. I took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece. Took a few photos. I got my satellite phone out. I warmed the battery up in my armpit. I dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum. I dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor. And I got three voicemails. It's a special feeling. The entire planet is rotating beneath my feet. The    the whole world underneath me. I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket. She started crying. She asked me to call her back. I skied on for a week past the Pole. I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue. This was the last day I had on the ice. When I spoke to the    my project management team  they said   Look  Ben  conditions are getting too dangerous. There are huge areas of open water just south of your position. We'd like to pick you up. Ben  could you please look for an airstrip   This was the view outside my tent when I had this fateful phone call. I'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony  the expedition manager  he said   Look Ben  you've got to find     meters of flat  thick safe ice.  The only bit of ice I could find    it took me    hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip    was exactly     meters. I could measure it with my skis. I didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that. I thought  it'll have to do. It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing    the plane actually passed over four times  and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all. The pilot  I knew  was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy. I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed    a pretty emotional moment. So I thought  I've got to compose myself for Troy. I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type. The plane taxied up to where I was standing. The door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said   Hi  my name is Troy.  The co pilot was a lady called Monica. She sat there in a sort of hand knitted jumper. They were the least macho people I've ever met  but they made my day. Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice  we took a few photos. He climbed up the ladder. He said   Just    just get in the back.  He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front  and I climbed in the back. Taxied up and down the runway a few times  just to flatten it out a bit  and he said   Right  I'm going to    I'm going to give it a go.  And he    I've now learned that this is standard practice  but it had me worried at the time. He put his hand on the throttle. You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit. It's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle. Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his. I thought   God  here we go. We're  we're    this is all or nothing.  Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off. One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway  banking. I could see into the cockpit  Troy battling the controls  and he just took one hand off  reached back  flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit  and it was the  fasten seat belt  sign you can see on the wall. And only from the air did I see the big picture. Of course  when you're on the ice  you only ever see one obstacle at a time  whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water. This is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip. I mean  it really was starting to break up. Why  I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense. I'm not skiing along drawing maps  everyone knows where the North Pole is. At the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip. There's a cafe and there's a tourist shop. For me  this is about exploring human limits  about exploring the limits of physiology  of psychology and of technology. They're the things that excite me. And it's also about potential  on a personal level. This  for me  is a chance to explore the limits    really push the limits of my own potential  see how far they stretch. And on a wider scale  it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential  just doing three or four or five percent of what they're truly capable of. So  on a wider scale  I hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential  and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet. That's as close as I can come to summing that up. The next question is  how do you answer the call of nature at minus     The answer  of course  to which is a trade secret    and the last question  what's next  As quickly as possible  if I have a minute left at the end  I'll go into more detail. What's next  Antarctica. It's the coldest  highest  windiest and driest continent on Earth. Late       early       there was a race to be the first to the South Pole  the heart of the Antarctic continent. If you include the coastal ice shelves  you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf    it's the big one down here    the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France. Antarctica  if you include the ice shelves  is twice the size of Australia    it's a big place. And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen  the Norwegian    Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies    and Scott  the British guy  Captain Scott. Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs  all of which went wrong  and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot. They got to the Pole late January      to find a Norwegian flag already there. There was a tent  a letter to the Norwegian king. And they turned around  headed back to the coast  and all five of them died on the return journey. Since then  no one has ever skied    this was    years ago    since then  no one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back. Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing    no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan. Two of us are doing it. That's pretty much it. One final thought before I get to the toilet bit  is    is  I have a    and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten    but I have a    I have a school report. I was    years old  and it's framed above my desk at home. It says   Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile.  I think if I've learned anything  it's this  that no one else is the authority on your potential. You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of. Ladies and gentlemen  that's my story. Thank you very much.\n",
      "My journey to become a polar specialist  photographing  specializing in the polar regions  began when I was four years old  when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island  up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of     Inuit people  where  we  were one of three non Inuit families. And in this community  we didn't have a television  we didn't have computers  obviously  radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit  playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox  and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you  for just two minutes only  some images  a cross section of my work  to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile   Have You Ever.  I don't know why National Geographic has done this  they've never done this before  but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this  so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are    you'll see them at the start of the slide show    there's only about four images    but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white  but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear  or a Kermode bear. There are only     of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought  my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking  So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life  after I was a photographer  because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine  they remind us all the time  they publish pictures  not excuses. And after two months of sitting there    one day  thinking that it was all over  this incredible big white male came down  right beside me  three feet away from me  and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old growth forest and sat up beside this     year old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him  just in the forest  and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy. Brandi Carlile    Have you ever wandered lonely through the woods      And everything there feels just as it should     You're part of the life there     You're part of something good     If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods     Have you ever stared into a starry sky      Lying on your back  you're asking why     What's the purpose      I wonder  who am I      If you've ever stared into a starry sky     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     Aah  ah  aah     Ah  oh  oh  ah  ah  oh  oh     Have you ever stared into a starry sky      Have you ever been out walking in the snow      Tried to get back where you were before     You always end up     Not knowing where to go     If you've ever been out walking in the snow     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     Aah  ah  aah  ah  aah     Ah  ah  oh  ah  ah  oh  ah     Oh  ah  ah  ah     Ah  ah  oh  ah  ah  oh  oh     If you'd ever been out walking you would know   Paul Nicklen  Thank you very much. The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK  let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact  scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years  then they said    years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic  the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to    years. And what does that mean  After a while of reading this in the news  it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that  if we lose ice  we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears  they could become extinct in the next    to     years. And there's no better  sexier  more beautiful  charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal        lb. bearded seal    grabbed it  swam back and ate it. And he was so full  he was so happy and so fat eating this seal  that  as I approached him    about    feet away    to get this picture  his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate  he was so full    he probably had about     lbs of meat in his belly    and as he ate inside one side of his mouth  he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive  but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist    years ago  we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years  we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea  floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere  and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice  which is great for them  they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately     percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals  these are the  fatsicles  of the Arctic. These little  fat dumplings      pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice  and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi year ice that's    years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that  as this ice melts  these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's     ft.  we're on our safety lines  the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi year ice  that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice  you have     species of microorganisms. And in the spring  when the sun returns to the ice  it forms the phytoplankton  grows under that ice  and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed  and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips  my face is frozen  I can't feel my hands  I can't feel my feet. And I've come up  and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions  it's so extreme that  when I go down  almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant  and I'm looking up at him  and I'm going   Woo. Woo. Woo.  Which means   Take my camera.  And he thinks I'm saying   Take my picture.  So we had this little communication breakdown. But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales  bowhead whales  and narwhals  and polar bears  and leopard seals today  but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole  just through that hole that you just saw  and I looked up under the underside of the ice  and I was dizzy  I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous    no rope  no safety line  the whole world is moving around me    and I thought   I'm in trouble.  But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice  giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic  right here. And when you have low  productivity in this  in ice  the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly  science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over     years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived     years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals  these majestic narwhals with their eight foot long ivory tusks  don't have to be here  they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe  catch a breath  because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright  my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed  I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful  I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals  since the time of Shackleton  have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in         a scientist was taken down and drowned  and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like   We knew they were vicious. We knew they were.  And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea  I want to go to Antarctica  get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake    find out if they really are these vicious animals  or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh  and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. As a species  as humans  we like to say penguins are really cute  therefore  leopard seals eat them  so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute  and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are    ft. long  a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get    tourists packed into a Zodiac  floating in these icy waters  and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink  they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing    it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean    it doesn't have hands    it's going to take a little bite  the boat pops  and off they go. So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage    isn't that beautiful    after five days of crossing the Drake Passage  we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden    Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat  and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice  he goes   That's a bloody big seal  ya.  And this seal is taking this penguin by the head  and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside out  so it can eat the meat off the bones  and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin  came under the boat  the Zodiac  starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down  and that's when Goran said to me   This is a good seal  ya. It's time for you to get in the water.  And I looked at Goran  and I said to him   Forget that.  But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter  F.  But he was right. He scolded me out  and said   This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses.  So I had such dry mouth    probably not as bad as now    but I had such  such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth  and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me  engulfed my whole camera    and her teeth are up here and down here    but Goran  before I had gotten in the water  had given me amazing advice. He said   If you get scared  you close your eyes  ya  and she'll go away.  So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes  and then the most amazing thing happened    she totally relaxed. She went off  she got a penguin. She stopped about    feet away from me  and she sat there with this penguin  the penguin's flapping  and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me  takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me  And after she did this four or five times  she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic  but I swear that she looked at me like   This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean.  So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins  she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me  bobbing like this  and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding  because I was crying underwater  just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this.  Laughter  And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones  so she brought me dead penguins. Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head  and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like   Are you for real   Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world  you're either breeding or you're eating    and I'm not breeding  so ... And then that wasn't enough  she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force feed my camera  which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated  she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would  I think  let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far  I got nervous because she came up to me  she rolled over on her back  and she did this deep  guttural jackhammer sound  this gok gok gok gok. And I thought  she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me  and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away  went and got its penguin and brought it to me. That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with    other leopard seals  and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with  and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears  these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart  and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic  I'll take you  let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you.\n",
      "Most of the time  art and science stare at each other across a gulf of mutual incomprehension. There is great confusion when the two look at each other. Art  of course  looks at the world through the psyche  the emotions    the unconscious at times    and of course the aesthetic. Science tends to look at the world through the rational  the quantitative    things that can be measured and described    but it gives art a terrific context of understanding. In the Extreme Ice Survey  we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together  to merging the art and science to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity's relationship with nature better. Specifically  I as a person who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life  am firmly of the belief that photography  video  film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape the way we think about nature and about ourselves in relationship to nature. In this project  we're specifically interested  of course  in ice. I'm fascinated by the beauty of it  the mutability of it  the malleability of it  and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself. These first images are from Greenland. But ice has another meaning. Ice is the canary in the global coal mine. It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action. Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world. Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less  Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder  What do the computer models say about this  that and the other thing  All of that  strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments  where the ice is  it's real and it's present. The changes are happening. They're very visible. They're photographable. They're measurable.    percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking. That's outside Antarctica.    percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking  and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing. There is no significant scientific dispute about that. It's been observed  it's measured  it's bomb proof information. And the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that. Science is not arguing about that. In these images we see ice from enormous glaciers  ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old breaking up into chunks  and chunk by chunk by chunk  iceberg by iceberg  turning into global sea level rise. So  having seen all of this in the course of a    year career  I was still a skeptic about climate change until about    years ago  because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models. I hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements of what the paleoclimates    the ancient climates    were  as recorded in the ice sheets  as recorded in deep ocean sediments  as recorded in lake sediments  tree rings  and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature. When I realized that climate change was real  and it was not based on computer models  I decided that one day I would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically. And that led me to this project. Initially  I was working on a National Geographic assignment    conventional  single frame  still photography. And one crazy day  I got the idea that I should    after that assignment was finished    I got the idea that I should shoot in time lapse photography  that I should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every    minutes  or every hour or whatever and watch the progression of the landscape over time. Well  within about three weeks  I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time lapse cameras into    time lapse cameras. And the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career  trying to design  build and deploy out in the field these    time lapse cameras. They are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them. Power goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer that tells the camera when to fire. And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers  and they look in on the glacier from permanent  bedrock positions  and they watch the evolution of the landscape. We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet. We actually drilled holes into the ice  way deep down below the thawing level  and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so. Actually  there's still a camera out there right now. In any case  the cameras shoot roughly every hour. Some of them shoot every half hour  every    minutes  every five minutes. Here's a time lapse of one of the time lapse units being made. I personally obsessed about every nut  bolt and washer in these crazy things. I spent half my life at our local hardware store during the months when we built these units originally. We're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere. Our time lapse units are in Alaska  the Rockies  Greenland and Iceland  and we have repeat photography positions  that is places we just visit on an annual basis  in British Columbia  the Alps and Bolivia. It's a big undertaking. I stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team. There's a lot of people working on this right now. We've got    cameras out this moment. We just had    cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern hemisphere  watching what's happened. And we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work. We've been out for two and a half years  and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go. That's only half our job. The other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public. You know  scientists have collected this kind of information off and on over the years  but a lot of it stays within the science community. Similarly  a lot of art projects stay in the art community  and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED  and like our relationship with the Obama White House  with the Senate  with John Kerry  to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well. We've done films. We've done books. We have more coming. We have a site on Google Earth that Google Earth was generous enough to give us  and so forth  because we feel very much the need to tell this story  because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now. Now  one bit of science before we get into the visuals. If everybody in the developed world understood this graph  and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads  there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this is the story that counts. Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion. Key issues  this is a         year record. This exact same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time. And several things are important. Number one  temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go up and down basically in sync. You can see that from the orange line and the blue line. Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to     parts per million. That's the natural cycle. Goes up to     and then drops for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here. But     is the peak. Right now  if you look at the top right part of that graph  we're at     parts per million. We are way  way outside the normal  natural variability. Earth is having a fever. In the past hundred years  the temperature of the Earth has gone up  .  degrees Fahrenheit  .   degrees Celsius  and it's going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere. At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year. It's been a remorseless  steady increase. We have to turn that around. That's the crux  and someday I hope to emblazon that across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places. But anyway  off to the world of ice. We're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska. This is a view of what's called the calving face. This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months. You see the glacier flowing in from the right  dropping off into the sea  camera shooting every hour. If you look in the middle background  you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo yo. That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable  and you're about to see the consequences of that floating. To give you a little bit of a sense of scale  that calving face in this picture is about     feet tall. That's    stories. This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center. The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off  but in fact  it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet. So there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep going down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock  and floating if it isn't. Here's what Columbia's done. This is in south central Alaska. This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago. This is an aerial picture we did this year. That's the retreat of this glacier. The main stem  the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right and it's going very rapidly up that stem. We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks  and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile  but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back  I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places  because as the glaciers    one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge  they're not normal landscapes    but as the glaciers are retreating  they're also deflating  like air is being let out of a balloon. And so  there are features on this landscape. There's a ridge right in the middle of the picture  up above where that arrow comes in  that shows you that a little bit. There's a marker line called the trim line above our little red illustration there. This is something no self respecting photographer would ever do    you put some cheesy illustration on your shot  right     and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points. But  in any case  the deflation of this glacier since      has been higher than the Eiffel Tower  higher than the Empire State Building. A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it's retreated and deflated  gone back up valley. These changes in the alpine world are accelerating. It's not static. Particularly in the world of sea ice  the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago  and the processes either are accelerating or the predictions were too low to begin with. But in any case  there are big  big changes happening as we speak. So  here's another time lapse shot of Columbia. And you see where it ended in these various spring days  June  May  then October. Now we turn on our time lapse. This camera was shooting every hour. Geologic process in action here. And everybody says  well don't they advance in the winter time  No. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier. Finally catches up to itself  it advances. And you can look at these pictures over and over again because there's such a strange  bizarre fascination in seeing these things you don't normally get to see come alive. We've been talking about  seeing is believing   and seeing the unseen at TED Global. That's what you see with these cameras. The images make the invisible visible. These huge crevasses open up. These great ice islands break off    and now watch this. This has been the springtime this year    a huge collapse. That happened in about a month  the loss of all that ice. So that's where we started three years ago  way out on the left  and that's where we were a few months ago  the last time we went into Columbia. To give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat  we did another cheesy illustration  with British double decker buses. If you line up     of those nose to tail  that's about how far back that was. It's a long way. On up to Iceland. One of my favorite glaciers  the S lheimaj kull. And here  if you watch  you can see the terminus retreating. You can see this river being formed. You can see it deflating. Without the photographic process  you would never see this. This is invisible. You can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this  but the camera records it. So we wind time backwards now. We go back a couple years in time. That's where it started. That's where it ended a few months ago. And on up to Greenland. The smaller the ice mass  the faster it responds to climate. Greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past century  but it really started galloping along about    years ago. And there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there. It's a big place. That's all ice. All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick  just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle. The one glacier up in Greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the Ilulissat Glacier. We have some cameras on the south edge of the Ilulissat  watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat. Here's a two year record of what that looks like. Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale  quickly dwarfed. The calving face is four and a half miles across  and in this shot  as we pull back  you're only seeing about a mile and a half. So  imagine how big this is and how much ice is charging out. The interior of Greenland is to the right. It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left. Icebergs  many  many  many  many times the size of this building  are roaring out to sea. We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago  as you can see. June   th  monster calving events happened. I'll show you one of those in a second. This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past    years. It now goes at     feet a day  dumping all this ice into the ocean. It tends to go in these pulses  about every three days  but on average      feet a day  twice the rate it did    years ago. Okay. We had a team out watching this glacier  and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film. We had nine cameras going. This is what a couple of the cameras saw. A     foot tall calving face breaking off. Huge icebergs rolling over. Okay  how big was that  It's hard to get it. So an illustration again  gives you a feeling for scale. A mile of retreat in    minutes across the calving face  in that particular event  three miles wide. The block was three fifths of a mile deep  and if you compare the expanse of the calving face to the Tower Bridge in London  about    bridges wide. Or if you take an American reference  to the U.S. Capitol Building and you pack       Capitol Buildings into that block  it would be equivalent to how large that block was.    minutes. Now I've come to the conclusion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world that we don't have a problem of economics  technology and public policy. We have a problem of perception. The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues  but we actually can deal with them. I'm certain that we can. But what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet. You're an elite audience. You get it. Fortunately  a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now. But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us. And that's where I think organizations like TED  like the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along. Because I believe we have an opportunity right now. We are nearly on the edge of a crisis  but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge of our generation and  in fact  of our century. This is a terrific  terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future. I hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done. Thank you.\n",

      "The universe is really big. We live in a galaxy  the Milky Way Galaxy. There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky  and you just keep the shutter open  as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope  it will see something like this. Every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way    a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs. There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe.     billion is the only number you need to know. The age of the universe  between now and the Big Bang  is a hundred billion in dog years. Which tells you something about our place in the universe. One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it. It's extremely beautiful. I've often wondered  what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn't have any. But we would also like to understand it. As a cosmologist  I want to ask  why is the universe like this  One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time. If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity  it would be moving away from you. And if you look at a galaxy even farther away  it would be moving away faster. So we say the universe is expanding. What that means  of course  is that  in the past  things were closer together. In the past  the universe was more dense  and it was also hotter. If you squeeze things together  the temperature goes up. That kind of makes sense to us. The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much is that the universe  at early times  near the Big Bang  was also very  very smooth. You might think that that's not a surprise. The air in this room is very smooth. You might say   Well  maybe things just smoothed themselves out.  But the conditions near the Big Bang are very  very different than the conditions of the air in this room. In particular  things were a lot denser. The gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the Big Bang. What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies  a hundred billion stars each. At early times  those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big    literally    at early times. And you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections  without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else. Because if there had been  they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole. Keeping the universe very  very smooth at early times is not easy  it's a delicate arrangement. It's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly. There is something that made it that way. We would like to know what. So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann  an Austrian physicist in the   th century. And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy. You've heard of entropy. It's the randomness  the disorder  the chaoticness of some systems. Boltzmann gave us a formula    engraved on his tombstone now    that really quantifies what entropy is. And it's basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice  so that macroscopically it looks the same. If you have the air in this room  you don't notice each individual atom. A low entropy configuration is one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way. A high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way. This is a crucially important insight because it helps us explain the second law of thermodynamics    the law that says that entropy increases in the universe  or in some isolated bit of the universe. The reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy. That's a wonderful insight  but it leaves something out. This insight that entropy increases  by the way  is what's behind what we call the arrow of time  the difference between the past and the future. Every difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increasing    the fact that you can remember the past  but not the future. The fact that you are born  and then you live  and then you die  always in that order  that's because entropy is increasing. Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy  it's very natural for it to increase because there's more ways to be high entropy. What he didn't explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place. The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very  very smooth. We'd like to understand that. That's our job as cosmologists. Unfortunately  it's actually not a problem that we've been giving enough attention to. It's not one of the first things people would say  if you asked a modern cosmologist   What are the problems we're trying to address   One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman.    years ago  he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures. He gave the popular lectures that became  The Character of Physical Law.  He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads that became  The Feynman Lectures on Physics.  He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students that became  The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation.  In every one of these books  every one of these sets of lectures  he emphasized this puzzle  Why did the early universe have such a small entropy  So he says    I'm not going to do the accent    he says   For some reason  the universe  at one time  had a very low entropy for its energy content  and since then the entropy has increased. The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding.  So that's our job. We want to know    this is    years ago   Surely   you're thinking   we've figured it out by now.  It's not true that we've figured it out by now. The reason the problem has gotten worse  rather than better  is because in      we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before. We learned that it's accelerating. The universe is not only expanding. If you look at the galaxy  it's moving away. If you come back a billion years later and look at it again  it will be moving away faster. Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster so we say the universe is accelerating. Unlike the low entropy of the early universe  even though we don't know the answer for this  we at least have a good theory that can explain it  if that theory is right  and that's the theory of dark energy. It's just the idea that empty space itself has energy. In every little cubic centimeter of space  whether or not there's stuff  whether or not there's particles  matter  radiation or whatever  there's still energy  even in the space itself. And this energy  according to Einstein  exerts a push on the universe. It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other. Because dark energy  unlike matter or radiation  does not dilute away as the universe expands. The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same  even as the universe gets bigger and bigger. This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future. For one thing  the universe will expand forever. Back when I was your age  we didn't know what the universe was going to do. Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future. Einstein was fond of this idea. But if there's dark energy  and the dark energy does not go away  the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.    billion years in the past      billion dog years  but an infinite number of years into the future. Meanwhile  for all intents and purposes  space looks finite to us. Space may be finite or infinite  but because the universe is accelerating  there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see. There's a finite region of space that we have access to  surrounded by a horizon. So even though time goes on forever  space is limited to us. Finally  empty space has a temperature. In the     s  Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole  even though you think it's black  it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics. The curvature of space time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation  and the black hole radiates. A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons showed that if you have dark energy in empty space  then the whole universe radiates. The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations. And so even though the universe will last forever  and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away  there will always be some radiation  some thermal fluctuations  even in empty space. So what this means is that the universe is like a box of gas that lasts forever. Well what is the implication of that  That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the   th century. He said  well  entropy increases because there are many  many more ways for the universe to be high entropy  rather than low entropy. But that's a probabilistic statement. It will probably increase  and the probability is enormously huge. It's not something you have to worry about    the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us. It's very  very unlikely. Except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever  that would happen. Everything that is allowed  every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room  would eventually be obtained. So Boltzmann says  look  you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium. He didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe. He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton    they were absolute  they just stuck there forever. So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere    the everything molecules. But if you're Boltzmann  you know that if you wait long enough  the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations. And then  of course  in the natural course of things  they will expand back. So it's not that entropy must always increase    you can get fluctuations into lower entropy  more organized situations. Well if that's true  Boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern sounding ideas    the multiverse and the anthropic principle. He says  the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can't live there. Remember  life itself depends on the arrow of time. We would not be able to process information  metabolize  walk and talk  if we lived in thermal equilibrium. So if you imagine a very  very big universe  an infinitely big universe  with randomly bumping into each other particles  there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states  and then they relax back. But there will also be large fluctuations. Occasionally  you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies. So Boltzmann says  we will only live in the part of the multiverse  in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles  where life is possible. That's the region where entropy is low. Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time. Now your homework assignment is to really think about this  to contemplate what it means. Carl Sagan once famously said that  in order to make an apple pie  you must first invent the universe.  But he was not right. In Boltzmann's scenario  if you want to make an apple pie  you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an apple pie. That will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven  and then making you an apple pie. So this scenario makes predictions. And the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal. Even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are  and we have  not only our memories  but our impression that outside there's something called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy  it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into Caltech  the United States and the galaxy. The good news is that  therefore  this scenario does not work  it is not right. This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation. Even if you left our galaxy out  you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies. And Feynman also understood this. Feynman says   From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation  all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before  we will find it mixed up  and not like the piece we've just looked at    high entropy. If our order were due to a fluctuation  we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it. We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation.  So that's good. The question is then what is the right answer  If the universe is not a fluctuation  why did the early universe have a low entropy  And I would love to tell you the answer  but I'm running out of time. Here is the universe that we tell you about  versus the universe that really exists. I just showed you this picture. The universe is expanding for the last    billion years or so. It's cooling off. But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more. If the dark energy remains around  the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel  they will stop burning. They will fall into black holes. We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes. That universe will last    to the     years    a lot longer than our little universe has lived. The future is much longer than the past. But even black holes don't last forever. They will evaporate  and we will be left with nothing but empty space. That empty space lasts essentially forever. However  you notice  since empty space gives off radiation  there's actually thermal fluctuations  and it cycles around all the different possible combinations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space. So even though the universe lasts forever  there's only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe. They all happen over a period of time equal to    to the    to the     years. So here's two questions for you. Number one  If the universe lasts for    to the    to the     years  why are we born in the first    billion years of it  in the warm  comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang  Why aren't we in empty space  You might say   Well there's nothing there to be living   but that's not right. You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness. Why aren't you  More homework assignment for you. So like I said  I don't actually know the answer. I'm going to give you my favorite scenario. Either it's just like that. There is no explanation. This is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions. Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe. An egg  an unbroken egg  is a low entropy configuration  and yet  when we open our refrigerator  we do not go   Hah  how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator.  That's because an egg is not a closed system  it comes out of a chicken. Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken. Maybe there is something that naturally  through the growth of the laws of physics  gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations. If that's true  it would happen more than once  we would be part of a much bigger multiverse. That's my favorite scenario. So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation. My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history. And    years from now  all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities. We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse. And even better  we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations. This is a prediction. I might be wrong. But we've been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like  why it came to be in the way it did for many  many years. It's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday. Thank you.\n",
      "There is nothing bigger or older than the universe. The questions I would like to talk about are  one  where did we come from  How did the universe come into being  Are we alone in the universe  Is there alien life out there  What is the future of the human race  Up until the     s  everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time. Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding. Distant galaxies were moving away from us. This meant they must have been closer together in the past. If we extrapolate back  we find we must have all been on top of each other about    billion years ago. This was the Big Bang  the beginning of the universe. But was there anything before the Big Bang  If not  what created the universe  Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did  We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts. First  there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe  given its state over all of space at one time. And second  there was no question of the initial state of the universe. We have made good progress on the first part  and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions. But until recently  we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe. However  this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct. Under extreme conditions  general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space. This removes the distinction between time and space  and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state. The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing. Moreover  we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states. These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background  which is an imprint of the very early universe. We think we have solved the mystery of creation. Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence. I now turn to the second big question  are we alone  or is there other life in the universe  We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth  so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets  of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy. But we don't know how life first appeared. We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing. The first is that we have fossils of algae from  .  billion years ago. The Earth was formed  .  billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years. So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible  which is short compared to the    billion year lifetime of a planet of Earth type. This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high. If it was very low  one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available. On the other hand  we don't seem to have been visited by aliens. I am discounting the reports of UFOs. Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos  If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring  it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far. Furthermore  despite an extensive search by the SETI project  we haven't heard any alien television quiz shows. This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years. Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet. This brings me to the last of the big questions  the future of the human race. If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy  we should make sure we survive and continue. But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history. Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially  along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill. But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past. It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years  let alone the next thousand or million. Our only chance of long term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet Earth  but to spread out into space. The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years. But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years  our future is in space. That is why I am in favor of manned    or should I say   personned    space flight. All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions. I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap. Indeed  it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge. The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe  and we are making good progress. Thank you for listening. Chris Anderson  Professor  if you had to guess either way  do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way  as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher  This answer took seven minutes  and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED. Stephen Hawking  I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years  otherwise we would have heard radio waves. The alternative is that civilizations don't last very long  but destroy themselves. CA  Professor Hawking  thank you for that answer. We will take it as a salutary warning  I think  for the rest of our conference this week. Professor  we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today. Thank you very much indeed.\n",
      "I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit  and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature. And so  I have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation  that is  looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning  and then following it up and trying to understand it. And so one of the questions that I asked you is  when you look around  what do you see  Well  you see this space that's created by designers and by the work of people  but what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here  being reshaped in a certain form. And so the question is  how did that material get here  How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped  and so forth  It's a question of what's the continuity  So one of the things I look at is  how did the universe begin and shape  What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials  So that's sort of the part  and let me move on then and show you the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. If you look at this picture  what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it. And everything but    four of these light objects are stars  and you can see them there    little pluses. This is a star  this is a star  everything else is a galaxy  OK  So there's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here. And when I look out at particularly this galaxy  which looks a lot like ours  I wonder if there's an art design college conference going on  and intelligent beings there are thinking about  you know  what designs they might do  and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from  and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what's going on over here. But there's a lot of other galaxies  and some are nearby  and they're kind of the color of the Sun  and some are further away and they're a little bluer  and so forth. But one of the questions is    this should be  to you    how come there are so many galaxies  Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky. This is only       galaxies. We think there's on the order    visible to the Hubble Space Telescope  if you had the time to scan it around    about     billion galaxies. Right  It's a very large number of galaxies. And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy. But when you look at some of these regions like this  you'll see more galaxies than stars  which is kind of a conundrum. So the question should come to your mind is  what kind of design  you know  what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that  And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated. We're going to try and follow it up. We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study  and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine  in a certain sense. We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it. Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres  just because that's where we're making observations. And the moon is only two seconds away  so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light  it's the moon two seconds ago  and who cares. Two seconds is like the present. The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal  right  unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way. You'd like to have a little advance warning. But you get out to Jupiter and it's    minutes away. It's a problem. You hear about Mars  it's a problem communicating to Mars because it takes light long enough to go there. But if you look out to the nearest set of stars  to the nearest    or    stars  it's about    years. So if you take a picture of what's going on  it's    years ago. But you go and look to the center of the galaxy  it's thousands of years ago. If you look at Andromeda  which is the nearest big galaxy  and it's two million years ago. If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago  there'd be no evidence of humans at all  because we don't think there were humans yet. I mean  it just gives you the scale. With the Hubble Space Telescope  we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years. But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further    there's some things even further  and that was what I did in a lot of my work  was to develop the techniques    we could look out back to even earlier epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies  back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different. And so that's the sort of sequence  and so I have a more artistic impression of this. There's the galaxy in the middle  which is the Milky Way  and around that are the Hubble    you know  nearby kind of galaxies  and there's a sphere that marks the different times. And behind that are some more modern galaxies. You see the whole big picture  The beginning of time is funny    it's on the outside  right  And then there's a part of the universe we can't see because it's so dense and so hot  light can't escape. It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun  you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun. But you can see the edge of the Sun  and the universe gets that way  and you can see that. And then you see this sort of model area around the outside  and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang  which is actually incredibly uniform. The universe is almost a perfect sphere  but there are these very tiny variations which we show here in great exaggeration. And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies  and eventually the solar system  and so forth. So it's a big design job  but we'll see about how things are going on. So the way these measurements were done  there's been a set of satellites  and this is where you get to see. So there was the COBE satellite  which was launched in       and we discovered these variations. And then in       the MAP satellite was launched    the WMAP    and it made somewhat better pictures. And later this year    this is the cool stealth version  the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it  and you should look    the Planck satellite will be launched  and it will make very high resolution maps. And that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe. And what we saw was  we saw these variations  and then they told us the secrets  both about the structure of space time  and about the contents of the universe  and about how the universe started in its original motions. So we have this picture  which is quite a spectacular picture  and I'll come back to the beginning  where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning. And we go through a period of accelerating expansion  and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent  then to the Dark Ages  and then the first stars turn on  and they evolve into galaxies  and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies. And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming. And it's maturing up to the present time. And there's some spectacular things. And this wastebasket part  that's to represent what the structure of space time itself is doing during this period. And so this is a pretty weird model  right  What kind of evidence do we have for that  So let me show you some of nature's patterns that are the result of this. I always think of space time as being the real substance of space  and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean. It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on. So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies. So there's a dot on here for every galaxy. They go out and point a telescope at the sky  take a picture  identify what are stars and throw them away  look at the galaxies  estimate how far away they are  and plot them up. And just put radially they're going out that way. And you see these structures  this thing we call the Great Wall  but there are voids and those kinds of stuff  and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it. Now I'm going to show you this in  D. What happens is  you take pictures as the Earth rotates  you get a fan across the sky. There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy  or because there are no telescopes available to do it. So the next picture shows you the three dimensional version of this rotating around. Do you see the fan like scans made across the sky  Remember  every spot on here is a galaxy  and you see the galaxies  you know  sort of in our neighborhood  and you sort of see the structure. And you see this thing we call the Great Wall  and you see the complicated structure  and you see these voids. There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together  right. So there's an interesting pattern  but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern. We only have a million galaxies  right  So we're keeping  like  a million balls in the air but  what's going on  There's another survey which is very similar to this  called the Two degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey. Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million. And every time there's a galaxy    at its location there's a galaxy    and if we know anything about the galaxy  which we do  because there's a redshift measurement and everything  you put in the type of galaxy and the color  so this is the real representation. And when you're in the middle of the galaxies it's hard to see the pattern  it's like being in the middle of life. It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience  it's hard to see the pattern of this. So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this. And you'll see  first  the structure of the survey  and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there. So again  you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here. But you can see the voids  you can see the complicated structure  and you say  well  how did this happen  Suppose you're the cosmic designer. How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that  It's not just throwing them out at random. There's a more complicated process going on here. How are you going to end up doing that  And so now we're in for some serious play. That is  we have to seriously play God  not just change people's lives  but make the universe  right. So if that's your responsibility  how are you going to do that  What's the kind of technique  What's the kind of thing you're going to do  So I'm going to show you the results of a very large scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like  using  essentially  some of the play principles and some of the design principles that  you know  humans have labored so hard to pick up  but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning. And that is  you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules  but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated. And then you put in some randomness  some fluctuations and some randomness  and realize a whole bunch of different representations. So what I'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales. We're going to zoom in  but this is a plot of what it is. And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right. It's called dark matter. That is matter that doesn't interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does  the way the light's shining on me or on the stage. It's transparent to light  but in order for you to see it  we're going to make it white. OK  So the stuff that's in this picture that's white  that is the dark matter. It should be called invisible matter  but the dark matter we've made visible. And the stuff that is in the yellow color  that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies. So I'll show you the next movie. So this    we're going to zoom in. Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern. We're going to zoom in and zoom in. And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids. And when a number of filaments come together in a knot  that makes a supercluster of galaxies. This one we're zooming in on is somewhere between         and a million galaxies in that small region. So we live in the boonies. We don't live in the center of the solar system  we don't live in the center of the galaxy and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster. So we're zooming in. This is a region which probably has more than          on the order of a million galaxies in that region. We're going to keep zooming in. OK. And so I forgot to tell you the scale. A parsec is  .   light years. So a gigaparsec is three billion light years    that's the scale. So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance. Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here. That's the distance between us and Andromeda  right  These little specks that you're seeing in here  they're galaxies. Now we're going to zoom back out  and you can see this structure that  when we get very far out  looks very regular  but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations. So they're simple building blocks. There's a very simple fluid to begin with. It's got dark matter  it's got ordinary matter  it's got photons and it's got neutrinos  which don't play much role in the later part of the universe. And it's just a simple fluid and it  over time  develops into this complicated structure. And so you know when you first saw this picture  it didn't mean quite so much to you. Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies  right  and nodes  but you realize they're not even the main structure. There's a framework  which is the dark matter  the invisible matter  that's out there that's actually holding it all together. So let's fly through it  and you can see how much harder it is when you're in the middle of something to figure this out. So here's that same end result. You see a filament  you see the light is the invisible matter  and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up. And we're going to fly around  and we'll fly around  and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect  and you get a large cluster of galaxies. And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is  and you can see what it looks like. And so from inside  it doesn't look very complicated  right  It's only when you look at it at a very large scale  and explore it and so forth  you realize it's a very intricate  complicated kind of a design  right  And it's grown up in some kind of way. So the question is  how hard would it be to assemble this  right  How big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together  right  That's the issue  right  And so here we are. You see how the filament    you see how several filaments are coming together  therefore making this supercluster of galaxies. And you have to understand  this is not how it would actually look if you    first  you can't travel this fast  everything would be distorted  but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff. This is how  if you took billions of years to go around  it might look to you  right  And if you could see invisible matter  too. And so the idea is  you know  how would you put together the universe in a very simple way  We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe  everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope plus our other instruments  was once in a region that was smaller than an atom. It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations  but expanding at a tremendous rate. And those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes  and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background. And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on. So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation. This simulation was run on       processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one. So I'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture. So you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point  now four times smaller  and so forth. And you start seeing these networks  this cosmic web of structure forming. And this is a simple one  because it doesn't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it. And you see how the dark matter lumps up  and the ordinary matter just trails along behind. So there it is. At the beginning it's very uniform. The fluctuations are a part in        . There are a few peaks that are a part in         and then over billions of years  gravity just pulls in. This is light over density  pulls the material around in. That pulls in more material and pulls in more material. But the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form. And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now  in terms of its expansion. And at that point  the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger scale structure. So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see  and then only things that have started forming already are going to form  and then from then on it's going to go on. So we're able to do the simulation  but this is two days on a desktop. We need  you know     days on       processors to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before. So we have an idea of how to play seriously  creating the universe by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material  and we create everything we can see in any direction  right  from almost nothing    that is  something extremely tiny  extremely small    and it is almost perfect  except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in         level  which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see  that is  galaxies and stars and so forth. So we have a model  and we can calculate it  and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like. And that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was. So this is what we started with    years ago  with the Cosmic Background Explorer    made the map on the upper right  which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations  and actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that. Since then we've had WMAP  which just gives us higher angular resolution. We see the same large scale structure  but we see additional small scale structure. And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the Earth  what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth. You can see  well  you can  kind of pick out all the major continents  but that's about it. But what we're hoping when we get to Planck  we'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there  where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth. And you can also tell  because of the sharp edges and the way things fit together  there are some non linear processes. Geology has these effects  which is moving the plates around and so forth. You can see that just from the map alone. We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non linear effects that are starting to move  to modify  and are giving us a hint about how space time itself was actually created at the beginning moments. So that's where we are today  and that's what I wanted to give you  a flavor of. Give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like. Thank you.\n",
      "A hundred years ago this month  a    year old Albert Einstein stood up in front of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin to present a radical new theory of space  time and gravity  the general theory of relativity. General relativity is unquestionably Einstein's masterpiece  a theory which reveals the workings of the universe at the grandest scales  capturing in one beautiful line of algebra everything from why apples fall from trees to the beginning of time and space.      must have been an exciting year to be a physicist. Two new ideas were turning the subject on its head. One was Einstein's theory of relativity  the other was arguably even more revolutionary  quantum mechanics  a mind meltingly strange yet stunningly successful new way of understanding the microworld  the world of atoms and particles. Over the last century  these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe. It's thanks to relativity and quantum mechanics that we've learned what the universe is made from  how it began and how it continues to evolve. A hundred years on  we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics  but what's at stake now is rather different. The next few years may tell us whether we'll be able to continue to increase our understanding of nature  or whether maybe for the first time in the history of science  we could be facing questions that we cannot answer  not because we don't have the brains or technology  but because the laws of physics themselves forbid it. This is the essential problem  the universe is far  far too interesting. Relativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest that the universe should be a boring place. It should be dark  lethal and lifeless. But when we look around us  we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff  full of stars  planets  trees  squirrels. The question is  ultimately  why does all this interesting stuff exist  Why is there something rather than nothing  This contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics  and in the next few years  we may find out whether we'll ever be able to solve it. At the heart of this problem are two numbers  two extremely dangerous numbers. These are properties of the universe that we can measure  and they're extremely dangerous because if they were different  even by a tiny bit  then the universe as we know it would not exist. The first of these numbers is associated with the discovery that was made a few kilometers from this hall  at CERN  home of this machine  the largest scientific device ever built by the human race  the Large Hadron Collider. The LHC whizzes subatomic particles around a    kilometer ring  getting them closer and closer to the speed of light before smashing them into each other inside gigantic particle detectors. On July          physicists at CERN announced to the world that they'd spotted a new fundamental particle being created at the violent collisions at the LHC  the Higgs boson. Now  if you followed the news at the time  you'll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed  and you'd be forgiven for thinking we get that way every time we discover a new particle. Well  that is kind of true  but the Higgs boson is particularly special. We all got so excited because finding the Higgs proves the existence of a cosmic energy field. Now  you may have trouble imagining an energy field  but we've all experienced one. If you've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap  then you've felt the effect of a field. And the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field  except it has a constant value everywhere. It's all around us right now. We can't see it or touch it  but if it wasn't there  we would not exist. The Higgs field gives mass to the fundamental particles that we're made from. If it wasn't there  those particles would have no mass  and no atoms could form and there would be no us. But there is something deeply mysterious about the Higgs field. Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings  a bit like a light switch. It should either be off  so that it has a zero value everywhere in space  or it should be on so it has an absolutely enormous value. In both of these scenarios  atoms could not exist  and therefore all the other interesting stuff that we see around us in the universe would not exist. In reality  the Higgs field is just slightly on  not zero but        trillion times weaker than its fully on value  a bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position. And this value is crucial. If it were a tiny bit different  then there would be no physical structure in the universe. So this is the first of our dangerous numbers  the strength of the Higgs field. Theorists have spent decades trying to understand why it has this very peculiarly fine tuned number  and they've come up with a number of possible explanations. They have sexy sounding names like  supersymmetry  or  large extra dimensions.  I'm not going to go into the details of these ideas now  but the key point is this  if any of them explained this weirdly fine tuned value of the Higgs field  then we should see new particles being created at the LHC along with the Higgs boson. So far  though  we've not seen any sign of them. But there's actually an even worse example of this kind of fine tuning of a dangerous number  and this time it comes from the other end of the scale  from studying the universe at vast distances. One of the most important consequences of Einstein's general theory of relativity was the discovery that the universe began as a rapid expansion of space and time   .  billion years ago  the Big Bang. Now  according to early versions of the Big Bang theory  the universe has been expanding ever since with gravity gradually putting the brakes on that expansion. But in       astronomers made the stunning discovery that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up. The universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster driven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy. Now  whenever you hear the word  dark  in physics  you should get very suspicious because it probably means we don't know what we're talking about. We don't know what dark energy is  but the best idea is that it's the energy of empty space itself  the energy of the vacuum. Now  if you use good old quantum mechanics to work out how strong dark energy should be  you get an absolutely astonishing result. You find that dark energy should be    to the power of     times stronger than the value we observe from astronomy. That's one with     zeroes after it. This is a number so mind bogglingly huge that it's impossible to get your head around. We often use the word  astronomical  when we're talking about big numbers. Well  even that one won't do here. This number is bigger than any number in astronomy. It's a thousand trillion trillion trillion times bigger than the number of atoms in the entire universe. So that's a pretty bad prediction. In fact  it's been called the worst prediction in physics  and this is more than just a theoretical curiosity. If dark energy were anywhere near this strong  then the universe would have been torn apart  stars and galaxies could not form  and we would not be here. So this is the second of those dangerous numbers  the strength of dark energy  and explaining it requires an even more fantastic level of fine tuning than we saw for the Higgs field. But unlike the Higgs field  this number has no known explanation. The hope was that a complete combination of Einstein's general theory of relativity  which is the theory of the universe at grand scales  with quantum mechanics  the theory of the universe at small scales  might provide a solution. Einstein himself spent most of his later years on a futile search for a unified theory of physics  and physicists have kept at it ever since. One of the most promising candidates for a unified theory is string theory  and the essential idea is  if you could zoom in on the fundamental particles that make up our world  you'd see actually that they're not particles at all  but tiny vibrating strings of energy  with each frequency of vibration corresponding to a different particle  a bit like musical notes on a guitar string. So it's a rather elegant  almost poetic way of looking at the world  but it has one catastrophic problem. It turns out that string theory isn't one theory at all  but a whole collection of theories. It's been estimated  in fact  that there are    to the     different versions of string theory. Each one would describe a different universe with different laws of physics. Now  critics say this makes string theory unscientific. You can't disprove the theory. But others actually turned this on its head and said  well  maybe this apparent failure is string theory's greatest triumph. What if all of these    to the     different possible universes actually exist out there somewhere in some grand multiverse  Suddenly we can understand the weirdly fine tuned values of these two dangerous numbers. In most of the multiverse  dark energy is so strong that the universe gets torn apart  or the Higgs field is so weak that no atoms can form. We live in one of the places in the multiverse where the two numbers are just right. We live in a Goldilocks universe. Now  this idea is extremely controversial  and it's easy to see why. If we follow this line of thinking  then we will never be able to answer the question   Why is there something rather than nothing   In most of the multiverse  there is nothing  and we live in one of the few places where the laws of physics allow there to be something. Even worse  we can't test the idea of the multiverse. We can't access these other universes  so there's no way of knowing whether they're there or not. So we're in an extremely frustrating position. That doesn't mean the multiverse doesn't exist. There are other planets  other stars  other galaxies  so why not other universes  The problem is  it's unlikely we'll ever know for sure. Now  the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while  but in the last few years  we've started to get the first solid hints that this line of reasoning may get born out. Despite high hopes for the first run of the LHC  what we were looking for there    we were looking for new theories of physics  supersymmetry or large extra dimensions that could explain this weirdly fine tuned value of the Higgs field. But despite high hopes  the LHC revealed a barren subatomic wilderness populated only by a lonely Higgs boson. My experiment published paper after paper where we glumly had to conclude that we saw no signs of new physics. The stakes now could not be higher. This summer  the LHC began its second phase of operation with an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run. What particle physicists are all desperately hoping for are signs of new particles  micro black holes  or maybe something totally unexpected emerging from the violent collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. If so  then we can continue this long journey that began     years ago with Albert Einstein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature. But if  in two or three years' time  when the LHC switches off again for a second long shutdown  we've found nothing but the Higgs boson  then we may be entering a new era in physics  an era where there are weird features of the universe that we cannot explain  an era where we have hints that we live in a multiverse that lies frustratingly forever beyond our reach  an era where we will never be able to answer the question   Why is there something rather than nothing   Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Harry  even if you just said the science may not have some answers  I would like to ask you a couple of questions  and the first is  building something like the LHC is a generational project. I just mentioned  introducing you  that we live in a short term world. How do you think so long term  projecting yourself out a generation when building something like this  Harry Cliff  I was very lucky that I joined the experiment I work on at the LHC in       just as we were switching on  and there are people in my research group who have been working on it for three decades  their entire careers on one machine. So I think the first conversations about the LHC were in       and you start planning the machine without the technology that you know you're going to need to be able to build it. So the computing power did not exist in the early '  s when design work began in earnest. One of the big detectors which record these collisions  they didn't think there was technology that could withstand the radiation that would be created in the LHC  so there was basically a lump of lead in the middle of this object with some detectors around the outside  but subsequently we have developed technology. So you have to rely on people's ingenuity  that they will solve the problems  but it may be a decade or more down the line. BG  China just announced two or three weeks ago that they intend to build a supercollider twice the size of the LHC. I was wondering how you and your colleagues welcome the news. HC  Size isn't everything  Bruno. BG  I'm sure. I'm sure. It sounds funny for a particle physicist to say that. But I mean  seriously  it's great news. So building a machine like the LHC requires countries from all over the world to pool their resources. No one nation can afford to build a machine this large  apart from maybe China  because they can mobilize huge amounts of resources  manpower and money to build machines like this. So it's only a good thing. What they're really planning to do is to build a machine that will study the Higgs boson in detail and could give us some clues as to whether these new ideas  like supersymmetry  are really out there  so it's great news for physics  I think. BG  Harry  thank you. HC  Thank you very much.\n",
      "A few months ago the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever. And today  after briefly describing what they found  I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery  namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth  the Milky Way and other distant galaxies  we may find that our universe is not the only universe  but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse. Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one. I mean  most of us were raised to believe that the word  universe  means everything. And I say most of us with forethought  as my four year old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born. And last year I was holding her and I said   Sophia  I love you more than anything in the universe.  And she turned to me and said   Daddy  universe or multiverse   But barring such an anomalous upbringing  it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours  most with fundamentally different features  that would rightly be called universes of their own. And yet  speculative though the idea surely is  I aim to convince you that there's reason for taking it seriously  as it just might be right. I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts. In part one  I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed. In part two  I'll offer a solution to that mystery. It's based on an approach called string theory  and that's where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story. Finally  in part three  I'm going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation  which will pull all the pieces of the story together. Okay  part one starts back in      when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us  establishing that space itself is stretching  it's expanding. Now this was revolutionary. The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static. But even so  there was one thing that everyone was certain of  The expansion must be slowing down. That  much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward  the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space. Now let's fast forward to the     s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing. And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies  allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time. Here's the surprise  They found that the expansion is not slowing down. Instead they found that it's speeding up  going faster and faster. That's like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster. Now if you saw an apple do that  you'd want to know why. What's pushing on it  Similarly  the astronomers' results are surely well deserving of the Nobel Prize  but they raised an analogous question. What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever quickening speed  Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein's. You see  we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing  pulls objects together. But in Einstein's theory of gravity  his general theory of relativity  gravity can also push things apart. How  Well according to Einstein's math  if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy  sort of like a uniform  invisible mist  then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive  repulsive gravity  which is just what we need to explain the observations. Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space    we now call it dark energy  but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it    its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other  driving expansion to speed up  not slow down. And this explanation represents great progress. But I promised you a mystery here in part one. Here it is. When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up  look at what they found. This number is small. Expressed in the relevant unit  it is spectacularly small. And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number. We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics  but so far no one has found a way to do that. Now you might wonder  should you care  Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue  a technical detail of interest to experts  but of no relevance to anybody else. Well it surely is a technical detail  but some details really matter. Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality  and this peculiar number may be doing just that  as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes    an idea that naturally emerges from string theory  which takes me to part two  string theory. So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory. First off  what is it  Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream of a unified theory of physics  a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe. And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward. It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely  at first you'll find molecules and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles. But the theory says that if you could probe smaller  much smaller than we can with existing technology  you'd find something else inside these particles    a little tiny vibrating filament of energy  a little tiny vibrating string. And just like the strings on a violin  they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes. These little fundamental strings  when they vibrate in different patterns  they produce different kinds of particles    so electrons  quarks  neutrinos  photons  all other particles would be united into a single framework  as they would all arise from vibrating strings. It's a compelling picture  a kind of cosmic symphony  where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little  tiny strings can play. But there's a cost to this elegant unification  because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work. It has internal inconsistencies  unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar    extra dimensions of space. That is  we all know about the usual three dimensions of space. And you can think about those as height  width and depth. But string theory says that  on fantastically small scales  there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them. But even though the dimensions are hidden  they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate. And in string theory  vibration determines everything. So particle masses  the strengths of forces  and most importantly  the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions. So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions  we should be able to calculate these features  calculate the amount of dark energy. The challenge is we don't know the shape of the extra dimensions. All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math. Now when these ideas were first developed  there were only about five different candidate shapes  so you can imagine analyzing them one by one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe. But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes. From five  the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands    A large  but still manageable  collection to analyze  since after all  graduate students need something to do. But then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions  until today. The list of candidate shapes has soared to about    to the    . So  what to do  Well some researchers lost heart  concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions  each giving rise to different physical features  string theory would never make definitive  testable predictions. But others turned this issue on its head  taking us to the possibility of a multiverse. Here's the idea. Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other. Each is as real as every other  in the sense that there are many universes  each with a different shape  for the extra dimensions. And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery  the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize winning results. Because you see  if there are other universes  and if those universes each have  say  a different shape for the extra dimensions  then the physical features of each universe will be different  and in particular  the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different. Which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured would take on a wholly different character. In this context  the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy because there isn't just one number  there are many numbers. Which means we have been asking the wrong question. It's that the right question to ask is  why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there  And that's a question on which we can make headway. Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours  whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies  the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don't form. And in those universes that have much less dark energy  well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that  again  galaxies don't form. And without galaxies  there are no stars  no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes. So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life. And that would be that. Mystery solved  multiverse found. Now some find this explanation unsatisfying. We're used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe. But the point is  if the feature you're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality  then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided. An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number    why the Sun is    million miles away from the Earth. And he worked for decades trying to explain this number  but he never succeeded  and we know why. Kepler was asking the wrong question. We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars. So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number     million miles  well that is simply wrongheaded. Instead the right question to ask is  why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance  instead of any of the other possibilities  And again  that's a question we can answer. Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn't exist. And those planets that are much farther away from the star  well they're so cold that  again  our form of life would not take hold. So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life. And when it comes to planets and their distances  this clearly is the right kind of reasoning. The point is  when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain  it may also be the right kind of reasoning. One key difference  of course  is we know that there are other planets out there  but so far I've only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes. So to pull it all together  we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes. And that takes me to my final part  part three. Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang. You see  when we speak of the Big Bang  we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward. But there's a little secret. The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important  the Bang. It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang  but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself. And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory. It's called inflationary cosmology  which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space. The fuel is based on something called a quantum field  but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it's virtually impossible to use it all up  which means in the inflationary theory  the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one time event. Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang  but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs  each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes. And now  when we meld this with string theory  here's the picture we're led to. Each of these universes has extra dimensions. The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes. The different shapes yield different physical features. And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it's only in our universe that the physical features  like the amount of dark energy  are right for our form of life to take hold. And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider. One big remaining question  of course  is  could we ever confirm the existence of other universes  Well let me describe one way that might one day happen. The inflationary theory already has strong observational support. Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded  tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world  yielding a distinctive fingerprint  a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots  across space  which powerful telescopes have now observed. Going further  if there are other universes  the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide. And if our universe got hit by another  that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect. And so exotic as this picture is  it may one day be grounded in observations  establishing the existence of other universes. I'll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future. You see  we learned that our universe is not static  that space is expanding  that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies. But because the expansion is speeding up  in the very far future  those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won't be able to see them    not because of technological limitations  but because of the laws of physics. The light those galaxies emit  even traveling at the fastest speed  the speed of light  will not be able to overcome the ever widening gulf between us. So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static  inky  black stillness. And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit    a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong. Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era  like ours  attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies. But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge  Or would they believe in the black  static empty universe that their own state of the art observations reveal  I suspect the latter. Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration. It appears that it may not always be that way. Because today's astronomers  by turning powerful telescopes to the sky  have captured a handful of starkly informative photons    a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit. and the message echoing across the ages is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law. Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Brian  thank you. The range of ideas you've just spoken about are dizzying  exhilarating  incredible. How do you think of where cosmology is now  in a sort of historical side  Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion  BG  Well it's hard to say. When we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out  the natural question is  maybe we're already in that position and certain deep  critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves. So from that perspective  maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them. On the other hand  we now can understand how old the universe is. We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down   .   billion years ago    and yet  we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches. Holy cow  That's just amazing. So on the one hand  it's just incredible where we've gotten  but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future. CA  You're going to be around for the next few days. Maybe some of these conversations can continue. Thank you. Thank you  Brian.  BG  My pleasure. \n",

Because the personal  as you know  is political. And not enough is being done about this. And as we have watched women conquer breast cancer through the breast cancer campaign  this is what we need to do now with heart. Since       more women die in the U.S. than men. So where we used to think of heart disease as being a man's problem primarily    which that was never true  but that was kind of how everybody thought in the     s and '  s  and it was in all the textbooks. It's certainly what I learned when I was training. If we were to remain sexist  and that was not right  but if we were going to go forward and be sexist  it's actually a woman's disease. So it's a woman's disease now. And one of the things that you see is that male line  the mortality is going down  down  down  down  down. And you see the female line since       the gap is widening. More and more women  two  three  four times more women  dying of heart disease than men. And that's too short of a time period for all the different risk factors that we know to change. So what this really suggested to us at the national level was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies  which had been developed in men  by men  for men for the last    years    and they work pretty well in men  don't they     weren't working so well for women. So that was a big wake up call in the     's. Heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer. And the breast cancer campaign    again  this is not a competition. We're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign. We need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis. Now sometimes when people see this  I hear this gasp. We can all think of someone  often a young woman  who has been impacted by breast cancer. We often can't think of a young woman who has heart disease. I'm going to tell you why. Heart disease kills people  often very quickly. So the first time heart disease strikes in women and men  half of the time it's sudden cardiac death    no opportunity to say good bye  no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy  no opportunity to help her pick out a wig. Breast cancer  mortality is down to four percent. And that is the    years that women have advocated. Betty Ford  Nancy Reagan stood up and said   I'm a breast cancer survivor   and it was okay to talk about it. And then physicians have gone to bat. We've done the research. We have effective therapies now. Women are living longer than ever. That has to happen in heart disease  and it's time. It's not happening  and it's time. We owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women. As Barbara depicted in one of her amazing movies   Yentl   she portrayed a young woman who wanted an education. And she wanted to study the Talmud. And so how did she get educated then  She had to impersonate a man. She had to look like a man. She had to make other people believe that she looked like a man and she could have the same rights that the men had. Bernadine Healy  Dr. Healy  was a cardiologist. And right around that time  in the     's  that we saw women and heart disease deaths going up  up  up  up  up  she wrote an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine and said  the Yentl syndrome. Women are dying of heart disease  two  three  four times more than men. Mortality is not going down  it's going up. And she questioned  she hypothesized  is this a Yentl syndrome  And here's what the story is. Is it because women don't look like men  they don't look like that male pattern heart disease that we've spent the last    years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics  and therefore  they're not recognized for their heart disease. And they're just passed. They don't get treated  they don't get detected  they don't get the benefit of all the modern medicines. Doctor Healy then subsequently became the first female director of our National Institutes of Health. And this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research in the world. And it funds a lot of my research. It funds research all over the place. It was a very big deal for her to become director. And she started  in the face of a lot of controversy  the Women's Health Initiative. And every woman in the room here has benefited from that Women's Health Initiative. It told us about hormone replacement therapy. It's informed us about osteoporosis. It informed us about breast cancer  colon cancer in women. So a tremendous fund of knowledge despite  again  that so many people told her not to do it  it was too expensive. And the under reading was women aren't worth it. She was like   Nope. Sorry. Women are worth it.  Well there was a little piece of that Women's Health Initiative that went to National Heart  Lung  and Blood Institute  which is the cardiology part of the NIH. And we got to do the WISE study    and the WISE stands for Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation    and I have chaired this study for the last    years. It was a study to specifically ask  what's going on with women  Why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease  So in the WISE     years ago  we started out and said   Well wow  there's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that.  And our colleagues in Washington  D.C. had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die  compared to men who have heart attacks and die    and again  this is millions of people  happening every day    women  in their fatty plaque    and this is their coronary artery  so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle    women erode  men explode. You're going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology. So I'll describe the male pattern heart attack first. Hollywood heart attack. Ughhhh. Horrible chest pain. EKG goes pbbrrhh  so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal EKG. There's a big clot in the middle of the artery. And they go up to the cath lab and boom  boom  boom get rid of the clot. That's a man heart attack. Some women have those heart attacks  but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack  where it erodes  doesn't completely fill with clot  symptoms are subtle  EKG findings are different    female pattern. So what do you think happens to these gals  They're often not recognized  sent home. I'm not sure what it was. Might have been gas. So we picked up on that and we said   You know  we now have the ability to look inside human beings with these special catheters called IVUS  intravascular ultrasound.  And we said   We're going to hypothesize that the fatty plaque in women is actually probably different  and deposited differently  than men.  And because of the common knowledge of how women and men get fat. When we watch people become obese  where do men get fat  Right here  it's just a focal    right there. Where do women get fat  All over. Cellulite here  cellulite here. So we said   Look  women look like they're pretty good about putting kind of the garbage away  smoothly putting it away. Men just have to dump it in a single area.  So we said   Let's look at these.  And so the yellow is the fatty plaque  and panel A is a man. And you can see  it's lumpy bumpy. He's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries. Panel B is the woman  very smooth. She's just laid it down nice and tidy. And if you did that angiogram  which is the red  you can see the man's disease. So    years of honing and crafting these angiograms  we easily recognize male pattern disease. Kind of hard to see that female pattern disease. So that was a discovery. Now what are the implications of that  Well once again  women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem. So we are working now on a non invasive    again  these are all invasive studies. Ideally you would love to do all this non invasively. And again     years of good non invasive stress testing  we're pretty good at recognizing male pattern disease with stress tests. So this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We're doing this at the Cedars Sinai Heart Institute in the Women's Heart Center. We selected this for the research. This is not in your community hospital  but we would hope to translate this. And we're about two and a half years into a five year study. This was the only modality that can see the inner lining of the heart. And if you look carefully  you can see that there's a black blush right there. And that is microvascular obstruction. The syndrome  the female pattern now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction  or obstruction. The second reason we really liked MRI is that there's no radiation. So unlike the CAT scans  X rays  thalliums  for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart  every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation  we say   Do we really need that test   So we're very excited about M.R. You can't go and order it yet  but this is an area of active inquiry where actually studying women is going to advance the field for women and men. What are the downstream consequences then  when female pattern heart disease is not recognized  This is a figure from an editorial that I published in the European Heart Journal this last summer. And it was just a pictogram to sort of show why more women are dying of heart disease  despite these good treatments that we know and we have work. And when the woman has male pattern disease    so she looks like Barbara in the movie    they get treated. And when you have female pattern and you look like a woman  as Barbara does here with her husband  they don't get the treatment. These are our life saving treatments. And those little red boxes are deaths. So those are the consequences. And that is female pattern and why we think the Yentl syndrome actually is explaining a lot of these gaps. There's been wonderful news also about studying women  finally  in heart disease. And one of the the cutting edge areas that we're just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy. If you ask  what is the big difference between women and men physiologically  Why are there women and men  Because women bring new life into the world. That's all stem cells. So we hypothesized that female stem cells might be better at identifying the injury  doing some cellular repair or even producing new organs  which is one of the things that we're trying to do with stem cell therapy. These are female and male stem cells. And if you had an injured organ  if you had a heart attack and we wanted to repair that injured area  do you want those robust  plentiful stem cells on the top  Or do you want these guys  that look like they're out to lunch  And some of our investigative teams have demonstrated that female stem cells    and this is in animals and increasingly we're showing this in humans    that female stem cells  when put even into a male body  do better than male stem cells going into a male body. One of the things that we say about all of this female physiology    because again  as much as we're talking about women and heart disease  women do  on average  have better longevity than men    is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women. So this is not a zero sum game in anyway. Okay  so here's where we started. And remember  paths crossed in       and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease. What has happened in the last    years with this work  We are bending the curve. We're bending the curve. So just like the breast cancer story  doing research  getting awareness going  it works  you just have to get it going. Now are we happy with this  We still have two to three more women dying for every man. And I would propose  with the better longevity that women have overall  that women probably should theoretically do better  if we could just get treated. So this is where we are  but we have a long row to hoe. We've worked on this for    years. And I've told you  we've been working on male pattern heart disease for    years. So we're    years behind. And we'd like to think it's not going to take    years. And in fact  it probably won't. But we cannot stop now. Too many lives are at stake. So what do we need to do  You now  hopefully  have a more personal relationship with your heart. Women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awareness campaigns. The women are very good about getting mammograms now. And women do fundraising. Women participate. They have put their money where their mouth is and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns. This is what we need to do with heart disease now. And it's political. Women's health  from a federal funding standpoint  sometimes it's popular  sometimes it's not so popular. So we have these feast and famine cycles. So I implore you to join the Red Dress Campaign in this fundraising. Breast cancer  as we said  kills women  but heart disease kills a whole bunch more. So if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge  we have a lot of lives to save. So thank you for your attention.\n",
      "We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly  and in many of the places where it counts the most  women are  in fact  taking control of everything. In my mother's day  she didn't go to college. Not a lot of women did. And now  for every two men who get a college degree  three women will do the same. Women  for the first time this year  became the majority of the American workforce. And they're starting to dominate lots of professions    doctors  lawyers  bankers  accountants. Over    percent of managers are women these days  and in the    professions projected to grow the most in the next decade  all but two of them are dominated by women. So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men  believe it or not  and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture    what our romantic comedies look like  what our marriages look like  what our dating lives look like  and our new set of superheroes. For a long time  this is the image of American manhood that dominated    tough  rugged  in control of his own environment. A few years ago  the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen  who is a parody of American manhood  and that's what we have in our commercials today. The phrase  first born son  is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me. In American fertility clinics     percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys. And in places where you wouldn't think  such as South Korea  India and China  the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little  and families are no longer strongly preferring first born sons. If you think about this  if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots  you can see the evidence everywhere. You can see it in college graduation patterns  in job projections  in our marriage statistics  you can see it in the Icelandic elections  which you'll hear about later  and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference  that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women. Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women. The '  s and the '  s also come to mind. But the difference is that  back then  it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires  whereas this time  it's not about passion  and it's not about any kind of movement. This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. The         year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end  believe it or not  and that's why I talk about the  end of men.  Now all you men out there  this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes  because the point is that this is happening to all of us. I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love. And this is why I like to talk about this  because if we don't acknowledge it  then the transition will be pretty painful. But if we do take account of it  then I think it will go much more smoothly. I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago. I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else  and I started to notice a distinct pattern    that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women. And I remembered back to about    years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi called  Stiffed  The Betrayal of the American Man   in which she described how hard the recession had hit men  and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession. And I realized that two things were different this time around. The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men    that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy. And second  that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men  but it was also about what was happening to women. And now look at this second set of slides. These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years. These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago. Women  a majority of the workplace. And labor statistics  women take up most managerial jobs. This second set of headlines    you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift. And look at that last headline    young women earning more than young men. That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm. They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future. And they expected that it would be young families  or young men  just like it had always been. But in fact  they found something very surprising. It was young  single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood. And so they decided  because they were intrigued by this finding  to do a nationwide survey. So they spread out all the census data  and what they found  the guy described to me as a shocker  which is that in       out of       communities  women  young women  were making more money than young men. So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them. Now  I've just laid out the picture for you  but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening. And in a moment  I'm going to show you a graph  and what you'll see on this graph    it begins in       just before women start flooding the workforce  and it brings us up to our current day. And basically what you'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy. Now what does that mean  It means that the economy is dividing into high skill  high wage jobs and low skill  low wage jobs    and that the middle  the middle skill jobs  and the middle earning jobs  are starting to drop out of the economy. This has been going on for    years now. But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women. You'll see the women in red  and you'll see the men in blue. You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class  but see what happens to women and see what happens to men. There we go. So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class. Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men. The men sort of stagnate there  while the women zoom up in those high skill jobs. So what's that about  It looks like women got some power boost on a video game  or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth control pills that lets them shoot up high. But of course  it's not about that. What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot. We used to have a manufacturing economy  which was about building goods and products  and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy. Those two economies require very different skills  and as it happens  women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been. It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn't have a college degree  but you had a specific set of skills  and with the help of a union  you could make yourself a pretty good middle class life. But that really isn't true anymore. This new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength  which is what's helped men along all these years. What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills. You basically need intelligence  you need an ability to sit still and focus  to communicate openly  to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be  and those are things that women do extremely well  as we're seeing. If you look at management theory these days  it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton  right  You would be issuing orders from above. You would be very hierarchical. You would tell everyone below you what to do. But that's not what an ideal leader is like now. If you read management books now  a leader is somebody who can foster creativity  who can get his    get the employees    see  I still say  his     who can get the employees to talk to each other  who can basically build teams and get them to be creative. And those are all things that women do very well. And then on top of that  that's created a kind of cascading effect. Women enter the workplace at the top  and then at the working class  all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home. So that's childcare  elder care and food preparation. So those are all the jobs that are growing  and those are jobs that women tend to do. Now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out of work  middle aged  former steelworker guy to watch their children at home  and that would be good for the men  but that hasn't quite happened yet. To see what's going to happen  you can't just look at the workforce that is now  you have to look at our future workforce. And here the story is fairly simple. Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men. Why  This is a real mystery. People have asked men  why don't they just go back to college  to community college  say  and retool themselves  learn a new set of skills  Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that. They're used to thinking of themselves as providers  and they can't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college. So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college. And what's even more disturbing is what's happening with younger boys. There's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the  boy crisis.  Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys  for whatever reason  are doing worse in school than very young girls  and people have theories about that. Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum  and little girls are better at that than little boys  Or that we require kids to sit still too much  and so boys initially feel like failures  And some people say it's because  in  th grade  boys start dropping out of school. Because I'm writing a book about all this  I'm still looking into it  so I don't have the answer. But in the mean time  I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert  who's my    year old daughter  Noa  to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse. I mean they have much larger vocabulary. They learn much faster. They are more controlled. On the board today for losing recess tomorrow  only boys. Hanna Rosin  And why is that  Noa  Why  They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely. HR  So there you go. This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City    working class college. Certainly  when I was in college  I had certain expectations about my life    that my husband and I would both work  and that we would equally raise the children. But these college girls had a completely different view of their future. Basically  the way they said it to me is that they would be working    hours a day  that their husband would maybe have a job  but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies. And this was kind of a shocker to me. And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls   Men are the new ball and chain.  Now you laugh  but that quote has kind of a sting to it  right  And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain  and that's why I talk about us all going through this together. The night after I talked to these college girls  I also went to a men's group in Kansas  and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier. They were men who had been contractors  or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom  and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support. And the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age. He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority  that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore  and they were not really the providers. So who were they  And this was very disheartening for them. And what he did was he wrote down on the board            and he said   That's her salary   and then he wrote down         .   That's your salary. So who's the man now   he asked them.  Who's the damn man  She's the man now.  And that really sent a shudder through the room. And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this  because I think it can be pretty painful  and we really have to work through it. And the other reason it's kind of urgent is because it's not just happening in the U.S. It's happening all over the world. In India  poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India. In China  a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses  small businesses  faster than men. And here's my favorite example  which is in South Korea. Over several decades  South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about. They basically enshrined the second class status of women in the civil code. And if women failed to birth male children  they were basically treated like domestic servants. And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child. But over the '  s and '  s  the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize  and so what they did was  they started to push women into the workforce. Now they've been asking a question since        How strongly do you prefer a first born son   And now look at the chart. That's from      to     . How much do you prefer a first born son  So you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture. Now because we haven't fully processed this information  it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways  where you can see that the stereotypes are changing. And so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the  omega males  popping up  who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can't find a job. And they come up in lots of different forms. So we have the perpetual adolescent. We have the charmless misanthrope. Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato. And then here's a shocker  even America's most sexiest man alive  the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie. And then on the female side  you have the opposite  in which you have these crazy superhero women. You've got Lady Gaga. You've got our new James Bond  who's Angelina Jolie. And it's not just for the young  right  Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days. And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we've got these uber exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal. So for a long time in the economic sphere  we've lived with the term  glass ceiling.  Now I've never really liked this term. For one thing  it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another  because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling. And we're always below the glass ceiling  the women. And we have a lot of skill and experience  but it's a trick  so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling  And also   shattering the glass ceiling  is a terrible phrase. What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling  So the image that I like to think of  instead of glass ceiling  is the high bridge. It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge  but it's also pretty exhilarating  because it's beautiful up there  and you're looking out on a beautiful view. And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling. There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables. There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through. And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you. You can bring your husband along. You can bring your friends  or your colleagues  or your babysitter to walk along with you. And husbands can drag their wives across  if their wives don't feel ready. But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge  that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge  but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it. Thanks very much.\n",
      "Pat Mitchell  Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage. Sheryl Sandberg  First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out and see so many women. It's so not my regular experience   as I know anyone else's. PM  So when we first started talking about  maybe the subject wouldn't be social media  which we assumed it would be  but  that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership positions  particularly  in the sector of technology and social media. But how did that evolve for you as a thought  and end up being the TED Talk that you gave  SS  So I was really scared to get on  this stage and talk about women  because I grew up in the business  world  as I think so many of us did. You never talk about being a woman  because  someone might notice that you're a woman  right  They might notice. Or worse  if you say  woman    people on the other end of the table think you're asking for special  treatment  or complaining. Or worse  about to sue them.  And so I went through     Laughter  Right  I went through my entire business career  and never spoke about being a woman   never spoke about it publicly. But I also had noticed that it wasn't working. I came out of college over     years ago  and I thought that all of my peers were men and women   all the people above me were all men  but that would change  because your generation had done such  an amazing job fighting for equality  equality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't. Because year after year  I was one of fewer and fewer  and now  often the only woman in a room. And I talked to a bunch of people about  should I give a speech at TEDWomen  about women  and they said  oh no  no. It will end your business career. You  cannot be a serious business executive and speak about being a woman.  You'll never be taken seriously again. But fortunately  there were the few  the proud    like you    who told me I should give the speech  and I asked myself the question  Mark Zuckerberg might    the founder of Facebook and my boss    asks all of us  which is  what  would I do if I wasn't afraid  And the answer to what would I do if I wasn't  afraid is I would get on the TED stage  and talk about women  and leadership.  And I did  and survived.  Applause  PM  I would say  not only survived.  I'm thinking of that moment  Sheryl  when you and I were standing backstage  together  and you turned to me  and you told me a story. And I said    very last minute    you know   you really should share that story. SS  Oh  yeah. PM  What was that story  SS  Well  it's an important part of the  journey. So I had    TEDWomen    the original one was in D.C.    so I live here   so I had gotten on a plane the day before  and my daughter was three  she was  clinging to my leg   Mommy  don't go.  And Pat's a friend  and so  not related  to the speech I was planning on giving  which was chock full of facts and  figures  and nothing personal  I told Pat the story. I said  well   I'm having a hard day. Yesterday my daughter was clinging  to my leg  and  Don't go.  And you looked at me and said   you have to tell that story. I said  on the TED stage  Are you kidding  I'm going to get on a stage and admit  my daughter was clinging to my leg  And you said yes  because if you want to talk  about getting more women into leadership roles  you have to be honest about how hard it is. And I did. And I think that's a really  important part of the journey. The same thing happened when I wrote my book.  I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter  I thought it was fabulous. It was  chock full of data and figures  I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai  tribes  and their sociological patterns. My husband read it and he was like  this  is like eating your Wheaties.  Laughter  No one    and I apologize to Wheaties if there's  someone    no one  no one will read this book. And I realized through the process that I  had to be more honest and more open  and I had to tell my stories. My stories of still  not feeling as self confident as I should  in many situations. My first and  failed marriage. Crying at work. Felling like I didn't belong there   feeling guilty to this day. And part of my journey  starting on this stage   going to  Lean In   going to the foundation  is all about being more open and  honest about those challenges  so that other women can be more open and honest  and all of us can work together towards real equality. PM  I think that one of the most  striking parts about the book  and in my opinion  one of the reasons it's hit such  a nerve and is resonating around the world  is that you are personal in the book   and that you do make it clear that  while you've observed some things that are  very important for other women to know  that you've had the same challenges  that many others of us have  as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and  possibly the people who don't believe the same. So talk about that process  deciding  you'd go public with the private part  and then you would also put yourself in  the position of something of an expert on how to resolve those challenges. SS  After I did the TED Talk  what happened was    you know  I never really expected to write  a book  I'm not an author  I'm not a writer  and it was viewed a lot  and it really  started impacting people's lives. I got this great     one of the first  letters I got was from a woman who said that she was offered a really big  promotion at work  and she turned it down  and she told her best friend she turned  it down  and her best friend said  you really need to watch this TED Talk. And so she watched this TED Talk  and she  went back the next day  she took the job  she went home  and she handed her  husband the grocery list.  Laughter  And she said  I can do this. And what really mattered to me    it wasn't  only women in the corporate world  even though I did hear from a lot of  them  and it did impact a lot of them  it was also people of all different circumstances. There was a doctor I met who was an  attending physician at Johns Hopkins  and he said that until he saw my TED  Talk  it never really occurred to him that even though half the students in  his med school classes were women  they weren't speaking as much as  the men as he did his rounds. So he started paying attention  and as he waited for  raised hands  he realized the men's hands were up. So he started encouraging the  women to raise their hands more  and it still didn't work. So he told everyone  no more  hand raising  I'm cold calling. So he could call evenly on men and women.  And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better  and he was able to go back  to them and tell them that. And then there was the woman  stay at home  mom  lives in a really difficult neighborhood  with not a great school  she said that TED  Talk    she's never had a corporate job  but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school  and fight for a better teacher for her child. And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice. And I realized that other women and  men could find their voice through it  which is why I went from the talk to the book. PM  And in the book  you not only found your  voice  which is clear and strong in the book  but you also share what you've learned    the experiences of other people in the lessons. And that's what I'm thinking about  in terms of putting yourself in a    you became a sort of expert in how you lean in. So what did that feel like  and  become like in your life  To launch not just a book  not just  a best selling  best viewed talk  but a movement  where people began to  literally describe their actions at work as  I'm leaning in. SS  I mean  I'm grateful  I'm honored   I'm happy  and it's the very beginning. So I don't know if I'm an expert  or if anyone is  an expert. I certainly have done a lot of research. I have read every study  I have  pored over the materials  and the lessons are very clear.  Because here's what we know  What we know is that stereotypes are holding women  back from leadership roles all over the world. It's so striking.  Lean In  is very global   I've been all over the world  talking about it  and    cultures are so different. Even within our own country  to Japan   to Korea  to China  to Asia  Europe  they're so different. Except for one thing  gender. All over the world  no matter what our cultures are  we think men should be strong   assertive  aggressive  have voice  we think women should speak  when spoken to  help others. Now we have  all over the world  women are called  bossy.   There is a word for  bossy   for little girls  in every language there's one. It's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys  because if a little boy leads   there's no negative word for it  it's expected. But if a little girl leads  she's bossy. Now I know there aren't a lot of  men here  but bear with me. If you're a man  you'll have  to represent your gender. Please raise your hand if you've been  told you're too aggressive at work. If you're a woman  please raise your hand if you've  ever been told you're too aggressive at work. and it's deeply supported by the data. Now  do we think women are more  aggressive than men  Of course not. It's just that we judge them through a different lens  and a lot of the character traits that you must  exhibit to perform at work  to get results  to lead  are ones that we think  in a man  he's a boss  and in a woman  she's bossy. And the good news about this is that we  can change this by acknowledging it. One of the happiest moments  I had in this whole journey is  after the book came out  I stood on a stage  with John Chambers  the CEO of Cisco. He read the book. He stood on a stage with me  he  invited me in front of his whole management team  men and women  and he said  I thought we  were good at this. I thought I was good at this. And then I read this book  and I  realized that we    my company    we have called all of our  senior women too aggressive  and I'm standing on this stage  and I'm sorry. And I want you to know we're  never going to do it again. PM  Can we send that to a lot of other  people that we know   Applause  SS  And so John is doing that because  he believes it's good for his company  and so this kind of acknowledgement  of these biases can change it. And so next time you all see  someone call a little girl  bossy   you walk right up to that person   big smile  and you say   That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has  executive leadership skills.   Laughter  PM  I know that's what you're telling your daughter.  SS  Absolutely. PM  And you did focus in the book    and  the reason  as you said  in writing it  was to create a dialogue about this. I mean  let's just put it out there   face the fact that women are    in a time when we have more open  doors  and more opportunities    are still not getting to the leadership positions. So in the months that have come since the book  in which  Lean In  focused on that and said  here are some of the challenges that remain  and  many of them we have to own within ourselves and look at ourselves. What has changed  Have you seen changes  SS  Well  there's certainly more  dialogue  which is great. But what really matters to me   and I think all of us  is action. So everywhere I go  CEOs   they're mostly men  say to me  you're costing me so much money because all the women want to  be paid as much as the men. And to them I say  I'm not sorry at all.  Laughter  At all. I mean  the women should  be paid as much as the men. Everywhere I go  women tell me they ask for raises. Everywhere I go  women say they're getting  better relationships with their spouses  asking for more help at home  asking for the  promotions they should be getting at work  and importantly  believing it  themselves. Even little things. One of the governors of one of the states told me  that he didn't realize that more women were  in fact  literally sitting on the side  of the room  which they are  and now he made a rule that all the women  on his staff need to sit at the table. The foundation I started along  with the book  Lean In  helps women  or men  start circles    small groups  it can be     it can be however many  you want  which meet once a month. I would have hoped that by now  we'd have  about     circles. That would've been great. You know      times roughly   . There are over        circles  in    countries in the world. PM  Wow  that's amazing. SS  And these are people who  are meeting every single month. I met one of them  I was in Beijing. A group of women  they're all about    or      they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing  several of them grew up in very poor  rural China. These women are     they are told by  their society that they are  left over   because they are not yet married  and the process of coming together  once a month at a meeting is helping them define who they are for themselves. What they want in their careers. The  kind of partners they want  if at all. I looked at them  we went around  and introduced ourselves  and they all said their names  and where they're from  and I said  I'm Sheryl Sandberg   and this was my dream. And I kind of just started crying. Right  which  I admit  I do. Right   I've talked about it before. But the fact that a woman so far away out in  the world  who grew up in a rural village  who's being told to marry someone  she doesn't want to marry  can now go meet once a month with  a group of people and refuse that  and find life on her own terms. That's the kind of change we have to hope for. PM  Have you been surprised by  the global nature of the message  Because I think when the book first  came out  many people thought  well  this is a really important handbook  for young women on their way up. They need to look at this  anticipate  the barriers  and recognize them  put them out in the open  have the dialogue about it  but that it's really for women who are that.  Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world. And yet the book is being read  as you  say  in rural and developing countries. What part of that has surprised you  and  perhaps led to a new perspective on your part  SS  The book is about self confidence   and about equality. And it turns out  everywhere in the world   women need more self confidence  because the world tells us we're not equal to men. Everywhere in the world  we live in  a world where the men get  and   and women get  or.  I've never met a man who's been  asked how he does it all.  Laughter  Again  I'm going to turn to the men in the audience  Please raise your hand if you've  been asked  how do you do it all  Men only. Women  women. Please raise your hand  if you've been asked how you do it all  We assume men can do it all   slash    have jobs and children. We assume women can't  and that's ridiculous  because the great majority of women everywhere  in the world  including the United States  work full time and have children. And I think people don't fully understand  how broad the message is. There is a circle that's been started  for rescued sex workers in Miami. They're using  Lean In  to help  people make the transition back to what would be a fair life  really rescuing  them from their pimps  and using it. There are dress for success groups  in Texas which are using the book  for women who have never been to college. And we know there are groups  all the way to Ethiopia. And so these messages of equality    of how women  are told they can't have what men can have    how we assume that leadership is for men   how we assume that voice is for men  these affect all of us  and I  think they are very universal. And it's part of what TEDWomen does. It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in  which is more women  more voice  more equality. PM  If you were invited now to  make another TEDWomen talk  what would you say that is a result  of this experience  for you personally  and what you've learned about women  and men  as you've made this journey  SS  I think I would say    I tried to say this strongly  but I think I can say it more strongly    I want to say that the status quo is not enough. That it's not good enough  that it's  not changing quickly enough. Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book   another year of data came out from the U.S. Census. And you know what we found  No movement in the wage gap  for women in the United States. Seventy seven cents to the dollar. If you are a black woman     cents. If you are a Latina  we're at    cents. Do you know when the last  time those numbers went up      . We are stagnating  we are  stagnating in so many ways. And I think we are not really being honest about that  for so many reasons. It's so  hard to talk about gender. We shy away from the word  feminist    a word I really think we need to embrace. We have to get rid of the  word bossy and bring back    I think I would say in a louder voice   we need to get rid of the word  bossy  and bring back the word  feminist    because we need it. PM  And we all need to do a lot more leaning in. SS  A lot more leaning in. PM  Thank you  Sheryl. Thanks for leaning in and saying yes. SS  Thank you.\n",
      "Salaam. Namaskar. Good morning. Given my TED profile  you might be expecting that I'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends    the one that's currently got Wall Street and the World Bank buzzing    how to invest in women  how to empower them  how to save them. Not me. I am interested in how women are saving us. They're saving us by redefining and re imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities  polarities we've taken for granted for a long time  like the ones between modernity and tradition  First World and Third World  oppression and opportunity. In the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community  there's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing. What intrigues me most is how women are doing this  despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating. Why is it that women are  on the one hand  viciously oppressed by cultural practices  and yet at the same time  are the preservers of cultures in most societies  Is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance  When so many women and girls are beaten  raped  maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes    honor  religion  nationality    what allows women to replant trees  to rebuild societies  to lead radical  non violent movements for social change  Is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing  Or are they one and the same  Are we guilty  as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us at the TED conference in Oxford  of assuming that there is a single story of women's struggles for their rights while there are  in fact  many  And what  if anything  do men have to do with it  Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions. It's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people. In the process  I've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle. Among those who've helped open my eyes to a third way are  a devout Muslim in Afghanistan  a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia and a taboo breaker in Liberia. I'm indebted to them  as I am to my parents  who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life  were blessed with three daughters in this one. And for reasons equally unclear to me  seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us. I was born and raised here in India  and I learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down  pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all   Poor things. You only have three daughters. But you're young  you could still try again.  My sense of outrage about women's rights was brought to a boil when I was about   . My aunt  an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman  was widowed early. A flock of relatives descended on her. They took off her colorful sari. They made her wear a white one. They wiped her bindi off her forehead. They broke her bangles. Her daughter  Rani  a few years older than me  sat in her lap bewildered  not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother. Late that night  I heard my mother begging my father   Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene   And my father  in a low voice  muttering   I'm just the youngest brother  there's nothing I can do. This is tradition.  That's the night I learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world. Women don't make those rules  but they define us  and they define our opportunities and our chances. And men are affected by those rules too. My father  who had fought in three wars  could not save his own sister from this suffering. By     under the excellent tutelage of my mother  I was therefore  as you might expect  defiantly feminist. On the streets chanting    Hindi   Hindi  We are the women of India. We are not flowers  we are sparks of change.  By the time I got to Beijing in       it was clear to me  the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition. Soon after I returned from Beijing  I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization  founded by women  to support women's rights organizations around the globe. But barely six months into my new job  I met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions. Her name is Sakena Yacoobi. She walked into my office at a time when no one knew where Afghanistan was in the United States. She said to me   It is not about the burka.  She was the most determined advocate for women's rights I had ever heard. She told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside Afghanistan  and that her organization  the Afghan Institute of Learning  had started a school in Pakistan. She said   The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows is that the Koran requires and strongly supports literacy. The prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the Koran for themselves.  Had I heard right  Was a women's rights advocate invoking religion  But Sakena defies labels. She always wears a headscarf  but I've walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze. She starts every lecture with a prayer  but she's a single  feisty  financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of   . She is also immensely pragmatic.  This headscarf and these clothes   she says   give me the freedom to do what I need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work. When I had to open the school in the refugee camp  I went to see the imam. I told him  'I'm a believer  and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive.'  She smiles slyly.  He was flattered. He began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque. And after he would leave  women and girls would stay behind. We began with a small literacy class to read the Koran  then a math class  then an English class  then computer classes. In a few weeks  everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes.  Sakena is a teacher at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in Afghanistan. She is on the Taliban's hit list. I worry about her every time she travels across that country. She shrugs when I ask her about safety.  Kavita jaan  we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid. Look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face.  And I smile  and I nod  realizing I'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices  turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity. Their path is their own and it looks towards an Afghanistan that will be different. Being different is something the women of Lesbor in Zagreb  Croatia know all too well. To be a lesbian  a dyke  a homosexual in most parts of the world  including right here in our country  India  is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice. In post conflict societies like Croatia  where a hyper nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast. So enter a group of out dykes  young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from Macedonia to Bosnia  from Serbia to Slovenia. These folk singers met at college at a gender studies program. Many are in their   s  some are mothers. Many have struggled to come out to their communities  in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick  just queer. As Leah  one of the founders of the group  says   I like traditional music very much. I also like rock and roll. So Lesbor  we blend the two. I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion  in which people can really speak their voice  especially traditional songs from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic. After the war  lots of these songs were lost  but they are a part of our childhood and our history  and we should not forget them.  Improbably  this LGBT singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change  like alchemists turning discord into harmony. Their repertoire includes the Croatian national anthem  a Bosnian love song and Serbian duets. And  Leah adds with a grin   Kavita  we especially are proud of our Christmas music  because it shows we are open to religious practices even though Catholic Church hates us LGBT.  Their concerts draw from their own communities  yes  but also from an older generation  a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality  but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents. One father  who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir  now writes songs for them. In the Middle Ages  troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses  Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this  singing  connecting people divided by religion  nationality and language. Bosnians  Croats and Serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history  and Lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all. Yesterday  Mallika Sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given. The world Leymah Gbowee was given was a world at war. Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades. Leymah was not an activist  she was a mother of three. But she was sick with worry  She worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier  she worried her daughters would be raped  she worried for their lives. One night  she had a dream. She dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed. The next morning at church  she asked others how they felt. They were all tired of the fighting. We need peace  and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace. Among Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim. She promised to raise the issue with her community. At the next Friday sermon  the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs.  What does it matter   they said   A bullet doesn't distinguish between a Muslim and a Christian.  This small group of women  determined to bring an end to the war  and they chose to use their traditions to make a point  Liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing. But no  for the protest  they dressed all in white  no makeup. As Leymah said   We wore the white saying we were out for peace.  They stood on the side of the road on which Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day. They stood for weeks    first just     then     then     then hundreds of women    wearing white  singing  dancing  saying they were out for peace. Eventually  opposing forces in Liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana. The peace talks dragged on and on and on. Leymah and her sisters had had enough. With their remaining funds  they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building. In a now famous CNN clip  you can see them sitting on the ground  their arms linked. We know this in India. It's called a  Hindi . Then things get tense. The police are called in to physically remove the women. As the senior officer approaches with a baton  Leymah stands up with deliberation  reaches her arms up over her head  and begins  very slowly  to untie her headdress that covers her hair. You can see the policeman's face. He looks embarrassed. He backs away. And the next thing you know  the police have disappeared. Leymah said to me later   It's a taboo  you know  in West Africa. If an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to  the man's family is cursed.  She said   I don't know if he did it because he believed  but he knew we were not going to leave. We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed.  And the peace accord was signed. And the women of Liberia then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in Africa in years. When she made her presidential address  she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia who allowed her to win against a football star    that's soccer for you Americans    no less. Women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that I should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind. They've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way. A Filipina activist once said to me   How do you cook a rice cake  With heat from the bottom and heat from the top.  The protests  the marches  the uncompromising position that women's rights are human rights  full stop. That's the heat from the bottom. That's Malcolm X and the suffragists and gay pride parades. But we also need the heat from the top. And in most parts of the world  that top is still controlled by men. So to paraphrase Marx  Women make change  but not in circumstances of their own choosing. They have to negotiate. They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations. And they need allies from their communities. Allies like the imam  allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in Croatia  allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away  allies like my father  who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams. Maybe this is because feminism  unlike almost every other social movement  is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor    it's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers    it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women  far too often  hold ourselves. And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism  that the personal is in fact the political. So that  as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights  the same is true of gender equality  that it starts in small places  close to home. On the streets  yes  but also in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends. And then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles  women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah    but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India and Michelle Bachelet in Chile and Shirin Ebadi in Iran    are doing something else. They're challenging the very notion of Western models of development. They are saying  we don't have to be like you to make change. We can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou  and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers. We can use our tradition to navigate change. We can demilitarize societies and pour resources  instead  into reservoirs of genuine security. It is in these little stories  these individual stories  that I see a radical epic being written by women around the world. It is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities  that I find hope. And if my heart is singing  it's because in these little fragments  every now and again  you catch a glimpse of a whole  of a whole new world. And she is definitely on her way. Thank you.\n",
      "So for any of us in this room today  let's start out by admitting we're lucky. We don't live in the world our mothers lived in  our grandmothers lived in  where career choices for women were so limited. And if you're in this room today  most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights  and amazingly  we still live in a world where some women don't have them. But all that aside  we still have a problem  and it's a real problem. And the problem is this  Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. The numbers tell the story quite clearly.     heads of state    nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world     percent are women. In the corporate sector  women at the top  C level jobs  board seats    tops out at        percent. The numbers have not moved since      and are going in the wrong direction. And even in the non profit world  a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women  women at the top     percent. We also have another problem  which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. A recent study in the U.S. showed that  of married senior managers  two thirds of the married men had children and only one third of the married women had children. A couple of years ago  I was in New York  and I was pitching a deal  and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture. And I'm in the meeting    it's about a three hour meeting    and two hours in  there needs to be that bio break  and everyone stands up  and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed. And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. So I start looking around for moving boxes  figuring they just moved in  but I don't see any. And so I said   Did you just move into this office   And he said   No  we've been here about a year.  And I said   Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year   And he looked at me  and he said   Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom.  So the question is  how are we going to fix this  How do we change these numbers at the top  How do we make this different  I want to start out by saying  I talk about this    about keeping women in the workforce    because I really think that's the answer. In the high income part of our workforce  in the people who end up at the top    Fortune     CEO jobs  or the equivalent in other industries    the problem  I am convinced  is that women are dropping out. Now people talk about this a lot  and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women. I want to talk about none of that today  even though that's all really important. Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals. What are the messages we need to tell ourselves  What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us  What are the messages we tell our daughters  Now  at the outset  I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments. I don't have the right answer. I don't even have it for myself. I left San Francisco  where I live  on Monday  and I was getting on the plane for this conference. And my daughter  who's three  when I dropped her off at preschool  did that whole hugging the leg  crying   Mommy  don't get on the plane  thing. This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes. I know no women  whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce  who don't feel that sometimes. So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone. My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce  and I think there are three. One  sit at the table. Two  make your partner a real partner. And three  don't leave before you leave. Number one  sit at the table. Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook  we hosted a very senior government official  and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley. And everyone kind of sat at the table. He had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department  and I kind of said to them   Sit at the table. Come on  sit at the table   and they sat on the side of the room. When I was in college  my senior year  I took a course called European Intellectual History. Don't you love that kind of thing from college  I wish I could do that now. And I took it with my roommate  Carrie  who was then a brilliant literary student    and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar    and my brother    smart guy  but a water polo playing pre med  who was a sophomore. The three of us take this class together. And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin  goes to all the lectures. I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures. My brother is kind of busy. He reads one book of    and goes to a couple of lectures  marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored. The three of us go to the exam together  and we sit down. And we sit there for three hours    and our little blue notebooks    yes  I'm that old. We walk out  we look at each other  and we say   How did you do   And Carrie says   Boy  I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic.  And I say   God  I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow.  And my brother says   I got the top grade in the class.   You got the top grade in the class  You don't know anything.  The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows  women systematically underestimate their own abilities. If you test men and women  and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs  men get it wrong slightly high  and women get it wrong slightly low. Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that    percent of boys entering  or men  I guess  are negotiating their first salary  and only seven percent of women. And most importantly  men attribute their success to themselves  and women attribute it to other external factors. If you ask men why they did a good job  they'll say   I'm awesome. Obviously. Why are you even asking   If you ask women why they did a good job  what they'll say is someone helped them  they got lucky  they worked really hard. Why does this matter  Boy  it matters a lot. Because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side  not at the table  and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success  or they don't even understand their own success. I wish the answer were easy. I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for  these fabulous women   Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.  I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple. Because what the data shows  above all else  is one thing  which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. And everyone's nodding  because we all know this to be true. There's a really good study that shows this really well. There's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen. And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley  and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist. In         not so long ago    a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it  Howard  Roizen. And he gave the case out  both of them  to two groups of students. He changed exactly one word   Heidi  to  Howard.  But that one word made a really big difference. He then surveyed the students  and the good news was the students  both men and women  thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent  and that's good. The bad news was that everyone liked Howard. He's a great guy. You want to work for him. You want to spend the day fishing with him. But Heidi  Not so sure. She's a little out for herself. She's a little political. You're not sure you'd want to work for her. This is the complication. We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues  we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A  to reach for the promotion  to sit at the table  and we have to do it in a world where  for them  there are sacrifices they will make for that  even though for their brothers  there are not. The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this. And I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me  but I think important. I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about     employees  and a couple hours later  there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk  and she wanted to talk to me. I said  okay  and she sat down  and we talked. And she said   I learned something today. I learned that I need to keep my hand up.   What do you mean   She said   You're giving this talk  and you said you would take two more questions. I had my hand up with many other people  and you took two more questions. I put my hand down  and I noticed all the women did the same  and then you took more questions  only from the men.  And I thought to myself   Wow  if it's me    who cares about this  obviously    giving this talk    and during this talk  I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised  and the women's hands are still raised  how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women   We've got to get women to sit at the table. Message number two  Make your partner a real partner. I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home. The data shows this very clearly. If a woman and a man work full time and have a child  the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does  and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does. So she's got three jobs or two jobs  and he's got one. Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more  The causes of this are really complicated  and I don't have time to go into them. And I don't think Sunday football watching and general laziness is the cause. I think the cause is more complicated. I think  as a society  we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls. I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers  and it's hard. When I go to the Mommy and Me stuff and I see the father there  I notice that the other mommies don't play with him. And that's a problem  because we have to make it as important a job  because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home  for people of both genders  if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce. Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate. And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there  they also have more    how shall I say this on this stage  They know each other more in the biblical sense as well. Message number three  Don't leave before you leave. I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking    and I see this all the time    with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving. Here's what happens  We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy. And she starts thinking about having a child  and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child  she starts thinking about making room for that child.  How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing   And literally from that moment  she doesn't raise her hand anymore  she doesn't look for a promotion  she doesn't take on the new project  she doesn't say   Me. I want to do that.  She starts leaning back. The problem is that    let's say she got pregnant that day  that day    nine months of pregnancy  three months of maternity leave  six months to catch your breath    Fast forward two years  more often    and as I've seen it    women start thinking about this way earlier    when they get engaged  or married  when they start thinking about having a child  which can take a long time. One woman came to see me about this. She looked a little young. And I said   So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby   And she said   Oh no  I'm not married.  She didn't even have a boyfriend. I said   You're thinking about this just way too early.  But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back  Everyone who's been through this    and I'm here to tell you  once you have a child at home  your job better be really good to go back  because it's hard to leave that kid at home. Your job needs to be challenging. It needs to be rewarding. You need to feel like you're making a difference. And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did  if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities  you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal. Don't leave before you leave. Stay in. Keep your foot on the gas pedal  until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child    and then make your decisions. Don't make decisions too far in advance  particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making. My generation really  sadly  is not going to change the numbers at the top. They're just not moving. We are not going to get to where    percent of the population    in my generation  there will not be    percent of  women  at the top of any industry. But I'm hopeful that future generations can. I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women  would be a better world. It's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are  even though that would be very helpful. I think it would be a better world. I have two children. I have a five year old son and a two year old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home  and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed  but to be liked for her accomplishments. Thank you.\n",

      "What is so special about the human brain  Why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us  What does a human brain have or do that no other brain does  When I became interested in these questions about    years ago  scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of. Though it was based on very little evidence  many scientists thought that all mammalian brains  including the human brain  were made in the same way  with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain. This means that two brains of the same size  like these two  with a respectable     grams  should have similar numbers of neurons. Now  if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain  then the owners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities. And yet  one is a chimp  and the other is a cow. Now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it  but we eat them. I think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex  elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are. So this is a first indication that the  all brains are made the same way  scenario is not quite right. But let's play along. If all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes  larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains  and the larger the brain  the more cognitively able its owner should be. So the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able. And here comes the bad news  Our brain  not the largest one around. It seems quite vexing. Our brain weighs between  .  and  .  kilos  but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos  and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos  which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities. It must be really extraordinary  an exception to the rule. Theirs may be bigger  but ours is better  and it could be better  for example  in that it seems larger than it should be  with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies. So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body. That's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body. So the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes. Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are  so their brains should also be larger than ours  but instead it's the other way around. Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain. The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses. Although it weighs only two percent of the body  it alone uses    percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day. That's     calories out of a total of       calories  just to keep your brain working. So the human brain is larger than it should be  it uses much more energy than it should  so it's special. And this is where the story started to bother me. In biology  we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general  so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but not to us  Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way. Maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons. Maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest sized brain. Maybe the human brain  actually has the most neurons of any brain  regardless of its size  especially in the cerebral cortex. So this to me became the important question to answer  how many neurons does the human brain have  and how does that compare to other animals  Now  you may have heard or read somewhere that we have     billion neurons  so    years ago  I asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from. But nobody did. I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number  and I could never find it. It seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain  or in any other brain for that matter. So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain  and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup. It works like this  You take a brain  or parts of that brain  and you dissolve it in detergent  which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact  so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this  like a clear soup. This soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain. Now  the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup  you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid  so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution  you can count nuclei  and therefore tell how many cells that brain had. It's simple  it's straightforward  and it's really fast. So we've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far  and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way. Take rodents and primates  for instance  In larger rodent brains  the average size of the neuron increases  so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons. But primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger  which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain. The result is that a primate brain will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size  and the larger the brain  the larger this difference will be. Well  what about our brain then  We found that we have  on average     billion neurons     billion of which are in the cerebral cortex  and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning  and that    billion is the most neurons that any cortex has  I think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. But just as important is what the    billion neurons mean. Because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically  we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain. So  a rodent brain with    billion neurons would weigh    kilos. That's not possible. A brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight  and this impossible brain would go in the body of    tons. I don't think it looks like us. So this brings us to a very important conclusion already  which is that we are not rodents. The human brain is not a large rat brain. Compared to a rat  we might seem special  yes  but that's not a fair comparison to make  given that we know that we are not rodents. We are primates  so the correct comparison is to other primates. And there  if you do the math  you find that a generic primate with    billion neurons would have a brain of about  .  kilos  which seems just right  in a body of some    kilos  which in my case is exactly right  which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion  I am a primate. And all of you are primates. And so was Darwin. I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this. His brain  like ours  was made in the image of other primate brains. So the human brain may be remarkable  yes  but it is not special in its number of neurons. It is just a large primate brain. I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature. Why does it cost so much energy  then  Well  other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs  and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of  we could do the math. And it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same  an average of six calories  per billion neurons per day. So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple  linear function of its number of neurons  and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect. So the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons  and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal  the relative cost of our brain is large  but just because we're primates  not because we're special. Last question  then  how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons  and in particular  if great apes are larger than we are  why don't they have a larger brain  than we do  with more neurons  When we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain  I figured  maybe there's a simple reason. They just can't afford the energy for both a large body  and a large number of neurons. So we did the math. We calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods  and on the other hand  how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs  and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day. And what we found is that because neurons are so expensive  there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons. So a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most    billion neurons  but then its body cannot be any bigger than    kilos. To weigh any more than that  it has to give up neurons. So it's either a large body or a large number of neurons. When you eat like a primate  you can't afford both. One way out of this metabolic limitation would be to spend even more hours per day eating  but that gets dangerous  and past a certain point  it's just not possible. Gorillas and orangutans  for instance  afford about    billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating  and that seems to be about as much as they can do. Nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate. What about us  With our    billion neurons and    to    kilos of body mass  we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding  which is just not feasible. If we ate like a primate  we should not be here. How did we get here  then  Well  if our brain costs just as much energy as it should  and if we can't spend every waking hour of the day feeding  then the only alternative  really  is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods. And remarkably  that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago  when they invented cooking. To cook is to use fire to pre digest foods outside of your body. Cooked foods are softer  so they're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth  so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut  which makes them yield much more energy in much less time. So cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food  looking for food  and gobbling down food all day long. So because of cooking  what once was a major liability  this large  dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons  could now become a major asset  now that we could both afford  the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them. So I think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution  all of the while remaining just a primate brain. With this large brain now affordable by cooking  we went rapidly from raw foods to culture  agriculture  civilization  grocery stores  electricity  refrigerators  all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint. So what once was a solution now became the problem  and ironically  we look for the solution in raw food. So what is the human advantage  What is it that we have that no other animal has  My answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex  and I think that's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. And what is it that we do that no other animal does  and which I believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large  largest number of neurons in the cortex  In two words  we cook. No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do. And I think that's how we got to become human. Studying the human brain changed  the way I think about food. I now look at my kitchen  and I bow to it  and I thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans. Thank you very much.\n",
      "The kind of neuroscience that I do and my colleagues do is almost like the weatherman. We are always chasing storms. We want to see and measure storms    brainstorms  that is. And we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives  but we rarely see or listen to one. So I always like to start these talks by actually introducing you to one of them. Actually  the first time we recorded more than one neuron    a hundred brain cells simultaneously    we could measure the electrical sparks of a hundred cells in the same animal  this is the first image we got  the first    seconds of this recording. So we got a little snippet of a thought  and we could see it in front of us. I always tell the students that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer  because we are dealing with a system that is only comparable in terms of number of cells to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe. And here we are  out of billions of neurons  just recording     years ago  a hundred. We are doing a thousand now. And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature. Because  if you don't know yet  everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms  comes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains and define our memories  our beliefs  our feelings  our plans for the future. Everything that we ever do  everything that every human has ever done  do or will do  requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms. And the sound of a brainstorm  if you've never heard one  is somewhat like this. You can put it louder if you can. My son calls this  making popcorn while listening to a badly tuned A.M. station.  This is a brain. This is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing  your brain will sound like this    my brain  any brain. And what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time is to actually listen to these symphonies  these brain symphonies  and try to extract from them the messages they carry. In particular  about    years ago we created a preparation that we named brain machine interfaces. And you have a scheme here that describes how it works. The idea is  let's have some sensors that listen to these storms  this electrical firing  and see if you can  in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal    about half a second    let's see if we can read these signals  extract the motor messages that are embedded in it  translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time. And see if we can measure how well we can translate that message when we compare to the way the body does that. And if we can actually provide feedback  sensory signals that go back from this robotic  mechanical  computational actuator that is now under the control of the brain  back to the brain  how the brain deals with that  of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery. And that's exactly what we did    years ago. We started with a superstar monkey called Aurora that became one of the superstars of this field. And Aurora liked to play video games. As you can see here  she likes to use a joystick  like any one of us  any of our kids  to play this game. And as a good primate  she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer. So even before a target appears that she's supposed to cross with the cursor that she's controlling with this joystick  Aurora is trying to find the target  no matter where it is. And if she's doing that  because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor  she gets a drop of Brazilian orange juice. And I can tell you  any monkey will do anything for you if you get a little drop of Brazilian orange juice. Actually any primate will do that. Think about that. Well  while Aurora was playing this game  as you saw  and doing a thousand trials a day and getting    percent correct and     milliliters of orange juice  we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head and sending them to a robotic arm that was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making. Because the idea was to actually turn on this brain machine interface and have Aurora play the game just by thinking  without interference of her body. Her brainstorms would control an arm that would move the cursor and cross the target. And to our shock  that's exactly what Aurora did. She played the game without moving her body. So every trajectory that you see of the cursor now  this is the exact first moment she got that. That's the exact first moment a brain intention was liberated from the physical domains of a body of a primate and could act outside  in that outside world  just by controlling an artificial device. And Aurora kept playing the game  kept finding the little target and getting the orange juice that she wanted to get  that she craved for. Well  she did that because she  at that time  had acquired a new arm. The robotic arm that you see moving here    days later  after the first video that I showed to you  is under the control of Aurora's brain and is moving the cursor to get to the target. And Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm  but she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases. She can scratch her back  she can scratch one of us  she can play another game. By all purposes and means  Aurora's brain has incorporated that artificial device as an extension of her body. The model of the self that Aurora had in her mind has been expanded to get one more arm. Well  we did that    years ago. Just fast forward    years. Just last year we realized that you don't even need to have a robotic device. You can just build a computational body  an avatar  a monkey avatar. And you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them  or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar's arms or legs. And what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these avatars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world. And these objects are visually identical  but when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects  they send an electrical message that is proportional to the microtactile texture of the object that goes back directly to the monkey's brain  informing the brain what it is the avatar is touching. And in just four weeks  the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway    like a new sense. And you truly liberate the brain now because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar. And the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain without the interference of the skin. So what you see here is this is the design of the task. You're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets. And he has to select one because only one carries the reward  the orange juice that they want to get. And he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm  an arm that doesn't exist. And that's exactly what they do. This is a complete liberation of the brain from the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task. The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets. And he's sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain. And the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward. The legends that you see in the movie don't appear for the monkey. And by the way  they don't read English anyway  so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position. And yet  they can find them by tactile discrimination  and they can press it and select it. So when we look at the brains of these animals  on the top panel you see the alignment of     cells showing what happens with the brain activity  the electrical storms  of this sample of neurons in the brain when the animal is using a joystick. And that's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows. The basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions. The bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving and the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar. As fast as we can reset our computers  the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool  as if this too was a part of that primate's body. The brain is assimilating that too  as fast as we can measure. So that suggests to us that our sense of self does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies  but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we're commanding with our brains. Our violins  our cars  our bicycles  our soccer balls  our clothing    they all become assimilated by this voracious  amazing  dynamic system called the brain. How far can we take it  Well  in an experiment that we ran a few years ago  we took this to the limit. We had an animal running on a treadmill at Duke University on the East Coast of the United States  producing the brainstorms necessary to move. And we had a robotic device  a humanoid robot  in Kyoto  Japan at ATR Laboratories that was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain  a human brain  or a primate brain. What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke  so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her. So she could be rewarded  not by what her body was doing but for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet controlled by her brain activity. Funny thing  that round trip around the globe took    milliseconds less than it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head  the head of the monkey  and reach its own muscle. The monkey was moving a robot that was six times bigger  across the planet. This is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously. This is CB  fulfilling its dream in Japan under the control of the brain activity of a primate. So where are we taking all this  What are we going to do with all this research  besides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears  Well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world. Millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms into action  into movement. Although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements  they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord. So our idea is to create a bypass  is to use these brain machine interfaces to read these signals  larger scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again  bypass the lesion using computational microengineering and send it to a new body  a whole body called an exoskeleton  a whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients. And you can see an image produced by this consortium. This is a nonprofit consortium called the Walk Again Project that is putting together scientists from Europe  from here in the United States  and in Brazil together to work to actually get this new body built    a body that we believe  through the same plastic mechanisms that allow Aurora and other monkeys to use these tools through a brain machine interface and that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life. This same mechanism  we hope  will allow these patients  not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body  but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls. So I was told about    years ago that this would never happen  that this was close to impossible. And I can only tell you that as a scientist  I grew up in southern Brazil in the mid '  s watching a few crazy guys telling  us  that they would go to the Moon. And I was five years old  and I never understood why NASA didn't hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job  after all  they were very proficient    but just seeing that as a kid made me believe  as my grandmother used to tell me  that  impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true.  So they told me that it's impossible to make someone walk. I think I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice. Thank you.\n",
      "Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back  just the way I am    kind of a royal wave. You can mimic what you can see. You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm. Soon  you'll be able to look inside your brain and program  control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there. I'm going to tell you about that technology. People have wanted to look inside the human mind  the human brain  for thousands of years. Well  coming out of the research labs just now  for our generation  is the possibility to do that. People envision this as being very difficult. You had to take a spaceship  shrink it down  inject it into the bloodstream. It was terribly dangerous.  Laughter  You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries. But now  we have a real technology to do this. We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain. We're going to do it non invasively using MRI. We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation. We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain    literally  fly into his body    but more importantly  we can look into his mind. When Peter moves his arm  that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place. Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms  that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains. What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis. We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds  and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner. He can look at these        points of activation per second. If he can see this pattern in his own brain  he can learn how to control it. There have been three ways to try to impact the brain  the therapist's couch  pills and the knife. This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have. We all know that as we form thoughts  they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains. Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself  you pull your hand away. But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time  it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you. If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain  we can form  D models and watch in real time the brain process information  and then we can select the areas that produce the pain. So put your arms back up and flex your bicep. Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing. What you're seeing here is  we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient. This may shock you  but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time. They're watching their own brain activation  and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain. They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates. As they do it  in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled. When they control their brain  they can control their pain. This is an investigational technology  but  in clinical trials  we're seeing a    to    percent decrease in chronic pain patients. This is not  The Matrix.  You can only do this to yourself. You take control. I've seen inside my brain. You will too  soon. When you do  what do you want to control  You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself  all your experiences. These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail. But I want to leave with you the big question. We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into  using this technology  the human mind and brain. Where will we take it \n",
      "Sleep. It's something we spend about a third of our lives doing  but do any of us really understand what it's all about  Two thousand years ago  Galen  one of the most prominent medical researchers of the ancient world  proposed that while we're awake  our brain's motive force  its juice  would flow out to all the other parts of the body  animating them but leaving the brain all dried up  and he thought that when we sleep  all this moisture that filled the rest of the body would come rushing back  rehydrating the brain and refreshing the mind. Now  that sounds completely ridiculous to us now  but Galen was simply trying to explain something about sleep that we all deal with every day. See  we all know based on our own experience that when you sleep  it clears your mind  and when you don't sleep  it leaves your mind murky. But while we know a great deal more about sleep now than when Galen was around  we still haven't understood why it is that sleep  of all of our activities  has this incredible restorative function for the mind. So today I want to tell you about some recent research that may shed new light on this question. We've found that sleep may actually be a kind of elegant design solution to some of the brain's most basic needs  a unique way that the brain meets the high demands and the narrow margins that set it apart from all the other organs of the body. So almost all the biology that we observe can be thought of as a series of problems and their corresponding solutions  and the first problem that every organ must solve is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel all those cells of the body. In the brain  that is especially critical  its intense electrical activity uses up a quarter of the body's entire energy supply  even though the brain accounts for only about two percent of the body's mass. So the circulatory system solves the nutrient delivery problem by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to every corner of our body. You can actually see it in this video here. Here  we're imaging blood vessels in the brain of a living mouse. The blood vessels form a complex network that fills the entire brain volume. They start at the surface of the brain  and then they dive down into the tissue itself  and as they spread out  they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain. Now  just as every cell requires nutrients to fuel it  every cell also produces waste as a byproduct  and the clearance of that waste is the second basic problem that each organ has to solve. This diagram shows the body's lymphatic system  which has evolved to meet this need. It's a second parallel network of vessels that extends throughout the body. It takes up proteins and other waste from the spaces between the cells  it collects them  and then dumps them into the blood so they can be disposed of. But if you look really closely at this diagram  you'll see something that doesn't make a lot of sense. So if we were to zoom into this guy's head  one of the things that you would see there is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain. But that doesn't make a lot of sense  does it  I mean  the brain is this intensely active organ that produces a correspondingly large amount of waste that must be efficiently cleared. And yet  it lacks lymphatic vessels  which means that the approach that the rest of the body takes to clearing away its waste won't work in the brain. So how  then  does the brain solve its waste clearance problem  Well  that seemingly mundane question is where our group first jumped into this story  and what we found as we dove down into the brain  down among the neurons and the blood vessels  was that the brain's solution to the problem of waste clearance  it was really unexpected. It was ingenious  but it was also beautiful. Let me tell you about what we found. So the brain has this large pool of clean  clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid. We call it the CSF. The CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain  and wastes from inside the brain make their way out to the CSF  which gets dumped  along with  the waste  into the blood. So in that way  it sounds a lot like the lymphatic system  doesn't it  But what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste from inside the brain  they don't just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of CSF. Instead  there is a specialized network of plumbing that organizes and facilitates this process. You can see that in these videos. Here  we're again imaging into the brain of living mice. The frame on your left shows what's happening at the brain's surface  and the frame on your right shows what's happening down below the surface of the brain within the tissue itself. We've labeled the blood vessels in red  and the CSF that's surrounding the brain will be in green. Now  what was surprising to us was that the fluid on the outside of the brain  it didn't stay on the outside. Instead  the CSF was pumped back into and through the brain along the outsides of the blood vessels  and as it flushed down into the brain along the outsides of these vessels  it was actually helping to clear away  to clean the waste from the spaces between the brain's cells. If you think about it  using the outsides of these blood vessels like this is a really clever design solution  because the brain is enclosed in a rigid skull and it's packed full of cells  so there is no extra space inside it for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system. Yet the blood vessels  they extend from the surface of the brain down to reach every single cell in the brain  which means that fluid that's traveling along the outsides of these vessels can gain easy access to the entire brain's volume  so it's actually this really clever way to repurpose one set of vessels  the blood vessels  to take over and replace the function of a second set of vessels  the lymphatic vessels  to make it so you don't need them. And what's amazing is that no other organ takes quite this approach to clearing away the waste from between its cells. This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain. But our most surprising finding was that all of this  everything I just told you about  with all this fluid rushing through the brain  it's only happening in the sleeping brain. Here  the video on the left shows how much of the CSF is moving through the brain of a living mouse while it's awake. It's almost nothing. Yet in the same animal  if we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep  what we see is that the CSF is rushing through the brain  and we discovered that at the same time when the brain goes to sleep  the brain cells themselves seem to shrink  opening up spaces in between them  allowing fluid to rush through and allowing waste to be cleared out. So it seems that Galen may actually have been sort of on the right track when he wrote about fluid rushing through the brain when sleep came on. Our own research  now it's       years later  suggests that what's happening is that when the brain is awake and is at its most busy  it puts off clearing away the waste from the spaces between its cells until later  and then  when it goes to sleep and doesn't have to be as busy  it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode to clear away the waste from the spaces between its cells  the waste that's accumulated throughout the day. So it's actually a little bit like how you or I  we put off our household chores during the work week when we don't have time to get to it  and then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do when the weekend rolls around. Now  I've just talked a lot about waste clearance  but I haven't been very specific about the kinds of waste that the brain needs to be clearing during sleep in order to stay healthy. The waste product that these recent studies focused most on is amyloid beta  which is a protein that's made in the brain all the time. My brain's making amyloid beta right now  and so is yours. But in patients with Alzheimer's disease  amyloid beta builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain's cells  instead of being cleared away  like it's supposed to be  and it's this buildup of amyloid beta that's thought to be one of the key steps in the development of that terrible disease. So we measured how fast amyloid beta is cleared from the brain when it's awake versus when it's asleep  and we found that indeed  the clearance of amyloid beta is much more rapid from the sleeping brain. So if sleep  then  is part of the brain's solution to the problem of waste clearance  then this may dramatically change how we think about the relationship between sleep  amyloid beta  and Alzheimer's disease. A series of recent clinical studies suggest that among patients who haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease  worsening sleep quality and sleep duration are associated with a greater amount of amyloid beta building up in the brain  and while it's important to point out that these studies don't prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause Alzheimer's disease  they do suggest that the failure of the brain to keep its house clean by clearing away waste like amyloid beta may contribute to the development of conditions like Alzheimer's. So what this new research tells us  then  is that the one thing that all of you already knew about sleep  that even Galen understood about sleep  that it refreshes and clears the mind  may actually be a big part of what sleep is all about. See  you and I  we go to sleep every single night  but our brains  they never rest. While our body is still and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere  the elegant machinery of the brain is quietly hard at work cleaning and maintaining this unimaginably complex machine. Like our housework  it's a dirty and a thankless job  but it's also important. In your house  if you stop cleaning your kitchen for a month  your home will become completely unlivable very quickly. But in the brain  the consequences of falling behind may be much greater than the embarrassment of dirty countertops  because when it comes to cleaning the brain  it is the very health and function of the mind and the body that's at stake  which is why understanding these very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today may be critical for preventing and treating diseases of the mind tomorrow. Thank you.\n",
      "Today I want to tell you about a project being carried out by scientists all over the world to paint a neural portrait of the human mind. And the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single  general purpose processor  but a collection of highly specialized components  each solving a different specific problem  and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers. To give you a feel for this idea  imagine the following scenario  You walk into your child's day care center. As usual  there's a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up  but this time  the children's faces look weirdly similar  and you can't figure out which child is yours. Do you need new glasses  Are you losing your mind  You run through a quick mental checklist. No  you seem to be thinking clearly  and your vision is perfectly sharp. And everything looks normal except the children's faces. You can see the faces  but they don't look distinctive  and none of them looks familiar  and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon that you find your daughter. This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces actually happens to people. It's called prosopagnosia  and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain. The striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired  everything else is just fine. Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific mental deficits that can happen after brain damage. These syndromes collectively have suggested for a long time that the mind is divvied up into distinct components  but the effort to discover those components has jumped to warp speed with the invention of brain imaging technology  especially MRI. So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy at high resolution  so I'm going to show you in a second a set of MRI cross sectional images through a familiar object  and we're going to fly through them and you're going to try to figure out what the object is. Here we go. It's not that easy. It's an artichoke. Okay  let's try another one  starting from the bottom and going through the top. Broccoli  It's a head of broccoli. Isn't it beautiful  I love that. Okay  here's another one. It's a brain  of course. In fact  it's my brain. We're going through slices through my head like that. That's my nose over on the right  and now we're going over here  right there. So this picture's nice  if I do say so myself  but it shows only anatomy. The really cool advance with functional imaging happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just anatomy but activity  that is  where neurons are firing. So here's how this works. Brains are like muscles. When they get active  they need increased blood flow to supply that activity  and lucky for us  blood flow control to the brain is local  so if a bunch of neurons  say  right there get active and start firing  then blood flow increases just right there. So functional MRI picks up on that blood flow increase  producing a higher MRI response where neural activity goes up. So to give you a concrete feel for how a functional MRI experiment goes and what you can learn from it and what you can't  let me describe one of the first studies I ever did. We wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces  and there was already reason to think there might be such a thing based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia that I described a moment ago  but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain in a normal person  so we set out to look for it. So I was the first subject. I went into the scanner  I lay on my back  I held my head as still as I could while staring at pictures of faces like these and objects like these and faces and objects for hours. So as somebody who has pretty close to the world record of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner  I can tell you that one of the skills that's really important for MRI research is bladder control. When I got out of the scanner  I did a quick analysis of the data  looking for any parts of my brain that produced a higher response when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects  and here's what I saw. Now this image looks just awful by today's standards  but at the time I thought it was beautiful. What it shows is that region right there  that little blob  it's about the size of an olive and it's on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there. And what that part of my brain is doing is producing a higher MRI response  that is  higher neural activity  when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects. So that's pretty cool  but how do we know this isn't a fluke  Well  the easiest way is to just do the experiment again. So I got back in the scanner  I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects and I got a similar blob  and then I did it again and I did it again and again and again  and around about then I decided to believe it was for real. But still  maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there  so to find out  we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain. So the next question was  what does this thing really do  Is it really specialized just for face recognition  Well  maybe not  right  Maybe it responds not only to faces but to any body part. Maybe it responds to anything human or anything alive or anything round. The only way to be really sure that that region is specialized for face recognition is to rule out all of those hypotheses. So we spent much of the next couple of years scanning subjects while they looked at lots of different kinds of images  and we showed that that part of the brain responds strongly when you look at any images that are faces of any kind  and it responds much less strongly to any image you show that isn't a face  like some of these. So have we finally nailed the case that this region is necessary for face recognition  No  we haven't. Brain imaging can never tell you if a region is necessary for anything. All you can do with brain imaging is watch regions turn on and off as people think different thoughts. To tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function  you need to mess with it and see what happens  and normally we don't get to do that. But an amazing opportunity came about very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine tested this man who has epilepsy and who is shown here in his hospital bed where he's just had electrodes placed on the surface of his brain to identify the source of his seizures. So it turned out by total chance that two of the electrodes happened to be right on top of his face area. So with the patient's consent  the doctors asked him what happened when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain. Now  the patient doesn't know where those electrodes are  and he's never heard of the face area. So let's watch what happens. It's going to start with a control condition that will say  Sham  nearly invisibly in red in the lower left  when no current is delivered  and you'll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first. So let's watch. and tell me what happens when I do this. All right  Patient  Okay. Neurologist  One  two  three. Patient  Nothing. Neurologist  Nothing  Okay. I'm going to do it one more time. Look at my face. One  two  three. Patient  You just turned into somebody else. Your face metamorphosed. Your nose got saggy  it went to the left. You almost looked like somebody I'd seen before  but somebody different. That was a trip. Nancy Kanwisher  So this experiment   this experiment finally nails the case that this region of the brain is not only selectively responsive to faces but causally involved in face perception. So I went through all of these details about the face region to show you what it takes to really establish that a part of the brain is selectively involved in a specific mental process. Next  I'll go through much more quickly some of the other specialized regions of the brain that we and others have found. So to do this  I've spent a lot of time in the scanner over the last month so I can show you these things in my brain. So let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere. So we're oriented like that. You're looking at my head this way. Imagine taking the skull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that. Okay  now as you can see  the surface of the brain is all folded up. So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there. We want to see the whole thing  so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing. Next  let's find that face area I've been talking about that responds to images like these. To see that  let's turn the brain around and look on the inside surface on the bottom  and there it is  that's my face area. Just to the right of that is another region that is shown in purple that responds when you process color information  and near those regions are other regions that are involved in perceiving places  like right now  I'm seeing this layout of space around me and these regions in green right there are really active. There's another one out on the outside surface again where there's a couple more face regions as well. Also in this vicinity is a region that's selectively involved in processing visual motion  like these moving dots here  and that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain  and near that is a region that responds when you look at images of bodies and body parts like these  and that region is shown in lime green at the bottom of the brain. Now all these regions I've shown you so far are involved in specific aspects of visual perception. Do we also have specialized brain regions for other senses  like hearing  Yes  we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit  here's a region in dark blue that we reported just a couple of months ago  and this region responds strongly when you hear sounds with pitch  like these. In contrast  that same region does not respond strongly when you hear perfectly familiar sounds that don't have a clear pitch  like these. Okay. Next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech. Okay  now let's look at these same regions. In my left hemisphere  there's a similar arrangement   not identical  but similar   and most of the same regions are in here  albeit sometimes different in size. Now  everything I've shown you so far are regions that are involved in different aspects of perception  vision and hearing. Do we also have specialized brain regions for really fancy  complicated mental processes  Yes  we do. So here in pink are my language regions. So it's been known for a very long time that that general vicinity of the brain is involved in processing language  but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selectively. They respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence  but not when you do other complex mental things  like mental arithmetic or holding information in memory or appreciating the complex structure in a piece of music. The most amazing region that's been found yet is this one right here in turquoise. This region responds when you think about what another person is thinking. So that may seem crazy  but actually  we humans do this all the time. You're doing this when you realize that your partner is going to be worried if you don't call home to say you're running late. I'm doing this with that region of my brain right now when I realize that you guys are probably now wondering about all that gray  uncharted territory in the brain  and what's up with that  Well  I'm wondering about that too  and we're running a bunch of experiments in my lab right now to try to find a number of other possible specializations in the brain for other very specific mental functions. But importantly  I don't think we have specializations in the brain for every important mental function  even mental functions that may be critical for survival. In fact  a few years ago  there was a scientist in my lab who became quite convinced that he'd found a brain region for detecting food  and it responded really strongly in the scanner when people looked at images like this. And further  he found a similar response in more or less the same location in    out of    subjects. So he was pretty stoked  and he was running around the lab telling everyone that he was going to go on  Oprah  with his big discovery. But then he devised the critical test  He showed subjects images of food like this and compared them to images with very similar color and shape  but that weren't food  like these. And his region responded the same to both sets of images. So it wasn't a food area  it was just a region that liked colors and shapes. So much for  Oprah.  But then the question  of course  is  how do we process all this other stuff that we don't have specialized brain regions for  Well  I think the answer is that in addition to these highly specialized components that I've been describing  we also have a lot of very general  purpose machinery in our heads that enables us to tackle whatever problem comes along. In fact  we've shown recently that these regions here in white respond whenever you do any difficult mental task at all   well  of the seven that we've tested. So each of the brain regions that I've described to you today is present in approximately the same location in every normal subject. I could take any of you  pop you in the scanner  and find each of those regions in your brain  and it would look a lot like my brain  although the regions would be slightly different in their exact location and in their size. What's important to me about this work is not the particular locations of these brain regions  but the simple fact that we have selective  specific components of mind and brain in the first place. I mean  it could have been otherwise. The brain could have been a single  general purpose processor  more like a kitchen knife than a Swiss Army knife. Instead  what brain imaging has delivered is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind. So we have this picture of very general purpose machinery in our heads in addition to this surprising array of very specialized components. It's early days in this enterprise. We've painted only the first brushstrokes in our neural portrait of the human mind. The most fundamental questions remain unanswered. So for example  what does each of these regions do exactly  Why do we need three face areas and three place areas  and what's the division of labor between them  Second  how are all these things connected in the brain  With diffusion imaging  you can trace bundles of neurons that connect to different parts of the brain  and with this method shown here  you can trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain  potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram of the entire human brain. Third  how does all of this very systematic structure get built  both over development in childhood and over the evolution of our species  To address questions like that  scientists are now scanning other species of animals  and they're also scanning human infants. Many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research by pointing out that it may help us someday to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism. That's a hugely important goal  and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it  but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that's worth doing. The effort to understand the human mind and brain is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment of a single disease. What could be more thrilling than to understand the fundamental mechanisms that underlie human experience  to understand  in essence  who we are  This is  I think  the greatest scientific quest of all time.\n",

      "Across Europe and Central Asia  approximately one million children live in large residential institutions  usually known as orphanages. Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children. Others know more about the living conditions there  but still think they're a necessary evil. After all  where else would we put all of those children who don't have any parents  But    years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development  and this is particularly true for young babies. As we know  babies are born without their full muscle development  and that includes the brain. During the first three years of life  the brain grows to its full size  with most of that growth taking place in the first six months. The brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation. Every time a young baby learns something new    to focus its eyes  to mimic a movement or a facial expression  to pick something up  to form a word or to sit up    new synaptic connections are being built in the brain. New parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning. They are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness. They communicate their delight to their children  who respond with smiles  and a desire to achieve more and to learn more. This forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical  social  language  cognitive and psychomotor development. It is the model for all future relationships with friends  with partners and with their own children. It happens so naturally in most families that we don't even notice it. Most of us are unaware of its importance to human development and  by extension  to the development of a healthy society. And it's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children. In August        I had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting. Those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of Romania after the      revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions. I was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families. Housing     babies  this was Ceausescu's show orphanage  and so I'd been told the conditions were much better. Having worked with lots of young children  I expected the institution to be a riot of noise  but it was as silent as a convent. It was hard to believe there were any children there at all  yet the director showed me into room after room  each containing row upon row of cots  in each of which lay a child staring into space. In a room of    newborns  not one of them was crying. Yet I could see soiled nappies  and I could see that some of the children were distressed  but the only noise was a low  continuous moan. The head nurse told me proudly   You see  our children are very well behaved.  Over the next few days  I began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional. The newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours  but their demands were not met  and so eventually they learned not to bother. Within a few days  they were listless  lethargic  and staring into space like all the others. Over the years  many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children  but often  one member of staff is caring for         and even    children. Hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program. The children must be woken at   and fed at     . At    their nappies must be changed  so a staff member may have only    minutes to feed    or    children. If a child soils its nappy at       he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again. The child's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing  and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling  the walls or the bars of their cots. Since my first visit to Ceausescu's institution  I've seen hundreds of such places across    countries  from the Czech Republic to Sudan. Across all of these diverse lands and cultures  the institutions  and the child's journey through them  is depressingly similar. Lack of stimulation often leads to self stimulating behaviors like hand flapping  rocking back and forth  or aggression  and in some institutions  psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children  whilst in others  children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others. These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities. Most of these children will never leave the institution again. For those without disabilities  at age three  they're transferred to another institution  and at age seven  to yet another. Segregated according to age and gender  they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings  often without even a chance to say goodbye. There's rarely enough to eat. They are often hungry. The older children bully the little ones. They learn to survive. They learn to defend themselves  or they go under. When they leave the institution  they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society. In Moldova  young women raised in institutions are    times more likely to be trafficked than their peers  and a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions  young adults     percent of them had a criminal record     percent were involved in prostitution  and    percent had taken their own lives. But why are there so many orphans in Europe when there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years  In fact  more than    percent of these children have living parents  and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children  but research shows that most parents want their children  and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty  disability and ethnicity. Many countries have not developed inclusive schools  and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school  at age six or seven. The institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home. If the family's poor  they find it difficult to visit  and gradually the relationship breaks down. Behind each of the million children in institutions  there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they've run out of options  like Natalia in Moldova  who only had enough money to feed her baby  and so had to send her older son to the institution  or Desi  in Bulgaria  who looked after her four children at home until her husband died  but then she had to go out to work full time  and with no support  felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution  or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they're pregnant  who leave their babies in a hospital  or the new parents  the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability  and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child's potential  are told by the doctors   Forget her  leave her in the institution  go home and make a healthy one.  This state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable. Every child has the right to a family  deserves and needs a family  and children are amazingly resilient. We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on  they recover their developmental delays  and go on to lead normal  happy lives. It's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions. One study suggests that a family support service costs    percent of an institutional placement  whilst good quality foster care costs usually about    percent. If we spend less on these children but on the right services  we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs. Across Europe  a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania nearly    years ago  there were         children living in institutions  and more entering every day. Now  there are less than         and family support services are provided across the country. In Moldova  despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis  the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than    percent in the last five years  and the resources are being redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools. Many countries have developed national action plans for change. The European Commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support  empowering communities to look after their own children. But there is still much to be done to end the systematic institutionalization of children. Awareness raising is required at every level of society. People need to know the harm that institutions cause to children  and the better alternatives that exist. If we know people who are planning to support orphanages  we should convince them to support family services instead. Together  this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime. Thank you.  Applause \n",
      "Contagious is a good word. Even in the times of H N   I like the word. Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious. Inspiration is contagious. We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers. But for me  what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the  I Can  bug. So  the question is  why only them  In a country of a billion people and some  why so few  Is it luck  Is it chance  Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected  So  in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story. I got infected when I was     when  as a student of the design college  I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas  challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me. And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt  and how contagious that feeling was. I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven. So  when I started Riverside school    years ago it became a lab  a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the  I Can  bug. And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real world context  that if you blur the boundaries between school and life  then children go through a journey of  aware   where they can see the change   enable   be changed  and then  empower   lead the change. And that directly increased student wellbeing. Children became more competent  and less helpless. But this was all common sense. So  I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside. A little background  when my grade five was learning about child rights  they were made to roll incense sticks  agarbattis  for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer. It transformed them. What you will see is their journey  and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world. That's them rolling. And in two hours  after their backs were broke  they were changed. And once that happened  they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished. And look at Ragav  that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset. And that can't happen in a classroom. So  when Ragav experienced that he went from  teacher told me   to  I am doing it.  And that's the  I Can  mindshift. And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured. But we had parents who said   Okay  making our children good human beings is all very well  but what about math and science and English  Show us the grades.  And we did. The data was conclusive. When children are empowered  not only do they do good  they do well  in fact very well  as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over       schools in India  Riverside children were outperforming the top    schools in India in math  English and science. So  it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside. So  on August   th  Independence Day        the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad. Now it was not about Riverside school. It was about all children. So  we were shameless. We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation  the police  the press  businesses  and basically said   When are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child  When will you include the child in the city  Basically  open your hearts and your minds to the child.  So  how did the city respond  Since      every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood. Here was a city telling its child   You can.  A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad. Video   Unclear  So  the busiest streets closed down. We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us. It gets taken over by children. They are skating. They are doing street plays. They are playing  all free  for all children. Atul Karwal  aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier. And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city. Kiran Bir Sethi  And the city will give free time. And Ahmedabad got the first child friendly zebra crossing in the world. Geet Sethi  When a city gives to the children  in the future the children will give back to the city. KBS  And because of that  Ahmedabad is known as India's first child friendly city. So  you're getting the pattern. First     children at Riverside. Then        children in Ahmedabad  and growing. It was time now to infect India. So  on August   th  again  Independence Day        empowered with the same process  we empowered         children to say   I can.  How  We designed a simple toolkit  converted it into eight languages  and reached        schools. We basically gave children a very simple challenge. We said  take one idea  anything that bothers you  choose one week  and change a billion lives. And they did. Stories of change poured in from all over India  from Nagaland in the east  to Jhunjhunu in the west  from Sikkim in the north  to Krishnagiri in the south. Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems. Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism  and    children who stopped    child marriages in Rajasthan. I mean  it was incredible. Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say   You can   then they will. Infection in India. This is in Rajasthan  a rural village. Child  Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write. KBS  First time  a rally and a street play in a rural school    unheard of    to tell their parents why literacy is important. Look at what their parents says. Man  This program is wonderful. We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write. Woman  I am so happy that my students did this campaign. In the future  I will never doubt my students' abilities. See  They have done it. KBS  An inner city school in Hyderabad. Girl     . This house is     ... We have to start collecting from    . KBS  Girls and boys in Hyderabad  going out  pretty difficult  but they did it. Woman  Even though they are so young  they have done such good work. First they have cleaned the society  then it will be Hyderabad  and soon India. Woman  It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me that they had so much inside them. Girl  Thank you  ladies and gentlemen. For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you  for a very good cause  the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids. Are you ready  ladies and gentlemen  Audience  Yes  Girl  Are you ready  Audience  Yes  Girl  Are you ready  Audience  Yes  KBS  So  the charter of compassion starts right here. Street plays  auctions  petitions. I mean  they were changing lives. It was incredible. So  how can we still stay immune  How can we stay immune to that passion  that energy  that excitement  I know it's obvious  but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change  Gandhiji.    years ago  it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of  We can.  So  today who is it going to take to spread the infection from         children to the     million children in India  Last I heard  the preamble still said   We  the people of India   right  So  if not us  then who  If not now  then when  Like I said  contagious is a good word. Thank you.\n",
      "I'm standing in front of you today in all humility  wanting to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and education. And I'm not a trained academic. Neither am I a veteran social worker. I was    years in the corporate world  trying to make organizations profitable. And then in      I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation from my kitchen table. The first thing that we did was walk through the slums. You know  by the way  there are two million people in Bangalore  who live in     slums. We couldn't go to all the slums  but we tried to cover as much as we could. We walked through these slums  identified houses where children would never go to school. We talked to the parents  tried to convince them about sending their children to school. We played with the children  and came back home really tired  exhausted  but with images of bright faces  twinkling eyes  and went to sleep. We were all excited to start  but the numbers hit us then      million children between four to    that should be going to school  but do not      million children who go to school but cannot read      million who cannot do basic maths. We also heard that     billion Indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling. Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary and administrators' salary. And yet  India has nearly the highest teacher absenteeism in the world  with one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year. Those numbers were absolutely mind boggling  overwhelming  and we were constantly asked   When will you start  How many schools will you start  How many children will you get  How are you going to scale  How are you going to replicate   It was very difficult not to get scared  not to get daunted. But we dug our heels and said   We're not in the number game. We want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school  sent to college  and get them prepared for better living  a high value job.  So  we started Parikrma. The first Parikrma school started in a slum where there were        people living below the poverty line. Our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums  a second story building  the only second story building inside the slums. And that rooftop did not have any ceiling  only half a tin sheet. That was our first school. One hundred sixty five children. Indian academic year begins in June. So  June it rains  so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof  waiting for the rain to stop. My God  What a bonding exercise that was. And all of us that were under that roof are still here together today. Then came the second school  the third school  the fourth school and a junior college. In six years now  we have four schools  one junior college        children coming from    slums and four orphanages. Our dream is very simple  to send each of these kids  get them prepared to be educated but also to live peacefully  contented in this conflict ridden chaotic globalized world. Now  when you talk global you have to talk English. And so all our schools are English medium schools. But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak English well. No one in their family has spoken English. No one in their generation has spoken English. But how wrong it is. Girl  I like adventurous books  and some of my favorites are Alfred Hitchcock and  unclear  and Hardy Boys. Although they are like in different contexts  one is magical  the other two are like investigation  I like those books because they have something special in them. The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing. I mean like once I pick up one book I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book. Even if it takes me four and a half hours  or three and half hours to finish my book  I do it. Boy  I did good research and I got the information  on the  world's fastest cars. I like Ducati ZZ     because it is the fastest  the world's fastest bike  and I like Pulsar     DTSI because it is India's fastest bike.  Laughter  Shukla Bose  Well  that girl that you saw  her father sells flowers on the roadside. And this little boy has been coming to school for five years. But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world love fast bikes   Laughter  He hasn't seen one  he hasn't ridden one  of course  but he has done a lot of research through Google search. You know  when we started with our English medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible  the ICSE curriculum. And again  there were people who laughed at me and said   Don't be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students. They'll never be able to cope.  Not only do our children cope very well  but they excel in it. You should just come across to see how well our children do. There is also this myth that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school  they'd much rather put them to work. That's absolute hogwash. All parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves  but they need to believe that change is possible. Video   Hindi  SB  We have    percent attendance for all our parents teachers meeting. Sometimes it's even     percent  much more than many privileged schools. Fathers have started to attend. It's very interesting. When we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register. Now they have started writing their signature. The children have taught them. It's amazing how much children can teach. We have  a few months ago  actually late last year  we had a few mothers who came to us and said   You know  we want to learn how to read and write. Can you teach us   So  we started an afterschool for our parents  for our mothers. We had    mothers who came regularly after school to study. We want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools. Ninety eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics. So  you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from. We have to send the fathers to de addiction labs and when they come back  most times sober  we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress. We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook. We have taught them nutrition  hygiene. We have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children. They do a very good job because their children are eating their food  but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect  and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile. More than    percent of our non teaching staff are all parents and extended families. We've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school. Vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school. There is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream. Take a look at this little girl who was one of the    children from all privileged schools  best schools in the country that was selected for the Duke University talent identification program and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad. Video  Girl  Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA  it was such a pride for us to go to that camp. Everybody was very friendly  especially I got a lot of friends. And I felt that my English has improved a lot going there and chatting with friends. There they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset  a totally different society. I mingled with almost everyone. They were very friendly. I had very good friends there  who are from Delhi  who are from Mumbai. Even now we are in touch through Facebook. After this Ahmedabad trip I've been like a totally different mingling with people and all of those. Before that I feel like I wasn't like this. I don't even mingle  or start speaking with someone so quickly. My accent with English improved a lot. And I learned football  volleyball  Frisbee  lots of games. And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here. Such beautiful food  I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful. I enjoyed eating food like  unclear  would come and ask me   Yes ma'am  what you want   It was so good to hear  SB  This girl was working as a maid before she came to school. And today she wants to be a neurologist. Our children are doing brilliantly in sports. They are really excelling. There is an inter school athletic competition that is held every year in Bangalore  where       children participate from     best schools in the city. We've got the best school award for three years successively. And our children are coming back home with bags full of medals  with lots of admirers and friends. Last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school. We also have our very own dream team. Why is this happening  Why this confidence  Is it the exposure  We have professors from MIT  Berkeley  Stanford  Indian Institute of Science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas  experiments  much beyond the classroom. Art  music are considered therapy and mediums of expression. We also believe that it's the content that is more important. It is not the infrastructure  not the toilets  not the libraries  but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important. Creating an environment of learning  of inquiry  of exploration is what is true education. When we started Parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking. We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan. But we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time  not get bogged with numbers  and actually see the child complete the circle of life  and unleash his total potential. We do not believe in scale because we believe in quality  and scale and numbers will automatically happen. We have corporates that have stood behind us  and we are able to  now  open more schools. But we began with the idea of one child at a time. This is five year old Parusharam. He was begging by a bus stop a few years ago  got picked up and is now in an orphanage  has been coming to school for the last four and a half months. He's in kindergarten. He has learned how to speak English. We have a model by which kids can speak English and understand English in three month's time. He can tell you stories in English of the thirsty crow  of the crocodile and of the giraffe. And if you ask him what he likes to do he will say   I like sleeping. I like eating. I like playing.  And if you ask him what he wants to do  he will say   I want to horsing.  Now   horsing  is going for a horse ride. So  Parusharam comes to my office every day. He comes for a tummy rub  because he believes that will give me luck.  Laughter  When I started Parikrma I began with a great deal of arrogance of transforming the world. But today I have been transformed. I have been changed with my children. I've learned so much from them  love  compassion  imagination and such creativity. Parusharam is Parikrma with a simple beginning but a long way to go. I promise you  Parusharam will speak in the TED conference a few years from now. Thank you.\n",
      " Even in purely non religious terms  homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty. It is a pathetic little second rate substitute for reality    a pitiable flight from life. As such  it deserves no compassion  it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom  and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness.  That's from Time magazine in       when I was three years old. And last year  the president of the United States came out in favor of gay marriage. And my question is  how did we get from there to here  How did an illness become an identity  When I was perhaps six years old  I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother. And at the end of buying our shoes  the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home. My brother wanted a red balloon  and I wanted a pink balloon. My mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon. But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one. And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue. The fact that my favorite color now is blue  but I'm still gay    is evidence of both my mother's influence and its limits. When I was little  my mother used to say   The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world. And until you have children  you don't know what it's like.  And when I was little  I took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about parenting my brother and me. And when I was an adolescent  I thought that I'm gay  and so I probably can't have a family. And when she said it  it made me anxious. And after I came out of the closet  when she continued to say it  it made me furious. I said   I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in. And I want you to stop saying that.  About    years ago  I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine to write a piece about deaf culture. And I was rather taken aback. I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness. Those poor people  they couldn't hear. They lacked hearing  and what could we do for them  And then I went out into the deaf world. I went to deaf clubs. I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry. I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville  Tennessee where people complained about that slurry Southern signing. And as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world  I become convinced that deafness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said   We don't lack hearing  we have membership in a culture   were saying something that was viable. It wasn't my culture  and I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it  but I appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it  it felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture. It felt as valid perhaps even as American culture. Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf. And when her daughter was born  she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me. She was facing the question of what to do with this child. Should she say   You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter   Or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity  get involved in the Little People of America  become aware of what was happening for dwarfs  And I suddenly thought  most deaf children are born to hearing parents. Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them. Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence. Most gay people are born to straight parents. Those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world  and those gay people have to discover identity later on. And here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter. And I thought  there it is again  A family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary. And I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity. There are vertical identities  which are passed down generationally from parent to child. Those are things like ethnicity  frequently nationality  language  often religion. Those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children. And while some of them can be difficult  there's no attempt to cure them. You can argue that it's harder in the United States    our current presidency notwithstanding    to be a person of color. And yet  we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to African Americans and Asians come out with creamy skin and yellow hair. There are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group. And I call them horizontal identities  because the peer group is the horizontal experience. These are identities that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers. And those identities  those horizontal identities  people have almost always tried to cure. And I wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identities come to a good relationship with them. And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place. There's self acceptance  there's family acceptance  and there's social acceptance. And they don't always coincide. And a lot of the time  people who have these conditions are very angry because they feel as though their parents don't love them  when what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them. Love is something that ideally is there unconditionally throughout the relationship between a parent and a child. But acceptance is something that takes time. It always takes time. One of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown. When he was born  he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism  a very disabling condition  and his parents were told that he would never walk  he would never talk  he would have no intellectual capacity  and he would probably not even recognize them. And it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly. And his mother said she wasn't going to do it. And she took her son home. And even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages  she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism  and she got Clinton enrolled with him. And in the course of his childhood  he had    major surgical procedures. And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures  as a result of which he now can walk. And while he was there  they sent tutors around to help him with his school work. And he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do. And he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family. He was the first one in his family  in fact  to go to college  where he lived on campus and drove a specially fitted car that accommodated his unusual body. And his mother told me this story of coming home one day    and he went to college nearby    and she said   I saw that car  which you can always recognize  in the parking lot of a bar   she said.  Laughter   And I thought to myself  they're six feet tall  he's three feet tall. Two beers for them is four beers for him.  She said   I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him  but I went home  and I left him eight messages on his cell phone.  She said   And then I thought  if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies      And I said to her   What do you think you did that helped him to emerge as this charming  accomplished  wonderful person   And she said   What did I do  I loved him  that's all. Clinton just always had that light in him. And his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there.  I'm going to quote from another magazine of the '  s. This one is from         The Atlantic Monthly  voice of liberal America    written by an important bioethicist. He said   There is no reason to feel guilty about putting a Down syndrome child away  whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible  lethal sense. It is sad  yes    dreadful. But it carries no guilt. True guilt arises only from an offense against a person  and a Down's is not a person.  There's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made in the treatment of gay people. The fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day. But we forget how we used to see people who had other differences  how we used to see people who were disabled  how inhuman we held people to be. And the change that's been accomplished there  which is almost equally radical  is one that we pay not very much attention to. One of the families I interviewed  Tom and Karen Robards  were taken aback when  as young and successful New Yorkers  their first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome. They thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be  and so they decided they would build a little center    two classrooms that they started with a few other parents    to educate kids with D.S. And over the years  that center grew into something called the Cooke Center  where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught. In the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran  the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled. The experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors  those who are writers  some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood. The Robards had a lot to do with that. And I said   Do you regret it  Do you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome  Do you wish you'd never heard of it   And interestingly his father said   Well  for David  our son  I regret it  because for David  it's a difficult way to be in the world  and I'd like to give David an easier life. But I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome  it would be a catastrophic loss.  And Karen Robards said to me   I'm with Tom. For David  I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life. But speaking for myself    well  I would never have believed    years ago when he was born that I could come to such a point    speaking for myself  it's made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more purposeful in my whole life  that speaking for myself  I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world.  We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up. And yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before. Most deaf infants born in the United States now will receive Cochlear implants  which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver  and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech. A compound that has been tested in mice  BMN      is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene. Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism  and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene  grow to full size. Testing in humans is around the corner. There are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before  making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies  or to terminate them. And so we have both social progress and medical progress. And I believe in both of them. I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful  and I think the same thing about the medical progress. But I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other. And when I see the way they're intersecting in conditions like the three I've just described  I sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan. We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether. And a lot of the time the question of parenthood is  what do we validate in our children  and what do we cure in them  Jim Sinclair  a prominent autism activist  said   When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism ' what they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist and I had a different  non autistic child instead.' Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence. This is what we hear when you pray for a cure    that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces.  It's a very extreme point of view  but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated. They want to be whoever it is that they've come to be. One of the families I interviewed for this project was the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre. It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me  and once they agreed  they were so full of their story that they couldn't stop telling it. And the first weekend I spent with them    the first of many    I recorded more than    hours of conversation. And on Sunday night  we were all exhausted. We were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner. And I said   If Dylan were here now  do you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him   And his father said   I sure do. I'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing.  And Sue looked at the floor  and she thought for a minute. And then she looked back up and said   I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head.  When I had dinner with her a couple of years later    one of many dinners that we had together    she said   You know  when it first happened  I used to wish that I had never married  that I had never had children. If I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom  this child wouldn't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened. But I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much that I don't want to imagine a life without them. I recognize the pain they caused to others  for which there can be no forgiveness  but the pain they caused to me  there is   she said.  So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world if Dylan had never been born  I've decided that it would not have been better for me.  I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems  problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid  and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting. And then I thought  all of us who have children love the children we have  with their flaws. If some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children I have and give me other  better children    more polite  funnier  nicer  smarter    I would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle. And ultimately I feel that in the same way that we test flame retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove  so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting  which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think  where did you come from  It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed    there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia  there are only so many families of children who are transgender  there are only so many families of prodigies    who also face similar challenges in many ways    there are only so many families in each of those categories    but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating difference within your family is what people are addressing  then you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon. Ironically  it turns out  that it's our differences  and our negotiation of difference  that unite us. I decided to have children while I was working on this project. And many people were astonished and said   But how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong   And I said   I'm not studying everything that can go wrong. What I'm studying is how much love there can be  even when everything appears to be going wrong.  I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen  a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect. And when his ashes were interred  his mother said   I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed  once of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved.  And I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so. So my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis. I had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children. And so she and I have a daughter  and mother and daughter live in Texas. And my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time of whom I am the biological father  and our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura  the lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis. So the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states. And there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family. And there are people who think that families like mine shouldn't be allowed to exist. And I don't accept subtractive models of love  only additive ones. And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on  so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness. The day after our son was born  the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned. He wasn't extending his legs appropriately. She said that might mean that he had brain damage. In so far as he was extending them  he was doing so asymmetrically  which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action. And he had a very large head  which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus. And as she told me all of these things  I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor. And I thought  here I had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of parenting children who are disabled  and I didn't want to join their number. Because what I was encountering was an idea of illness. And like all parents since the dawn of time  I wanted to protect my child from illness. And I wanted also to protect myself from illness. And yet  I knew from the work I had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for  that those would ultimately be his identity  and if they were his identity they would become my identity  that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded. We took him to the MRI machine  we took him to the CAT scanner  we took this day old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw. We felt helpless. And at the end of five hours  they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly. And when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on  she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp. But I thought how my mother was right. I thought  the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world  and until you have children  you don't know what it feels like. I think children had ensnared me the moment I connected fatherhood with loss. But I'm not sure I would have noticed that if I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine. I'd encountered so much strange love  and I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns. And I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities. During these    years  I had witnessed and learned the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility  and I had come to see how it conquers everything else. And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools  enslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children and trying to breed identity out of misery  I realized that day that my research had built me a plank and that I was ready to join them on their ship. Thank you.\n",
      "If you are a blind child in India  you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news. The first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none  and that's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults  and there are very  very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children. In fact  if you were to be treated  you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from Rajasthan illustrates. This is a three year old orphan girl who had cataracts. So  her caretakers took her to the village medicine man  and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital  the person decided to burn her abdomen with red hot iron bars to drive out the demons. The second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by neuroscientists  who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age  that even if you have your eye corrected  the chances of your brain learning how to see are very  very slim    again  slim or none. So when I heard these two things  it troubled me deeply  both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons. So let me first start with the personal reason. It'll sound corny  but it's sincere. That's my son  Darius. As a new father  I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are  what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child. I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius  and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment  that's just viscerally wrong. So that's the personal reason. Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods    that if the brain is older than four or five years of age  it loses its ability to learn    that doesn't sit well with me  because I don't think that idea has been tested adequately. The birth of the idea is from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work  two researchers who were at Harvard  and they got the Nobel Prize in      for their studies of visual physiology  which are remarkably beautiful studies  but I believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely. So  they did their work with kittens  with different kinds of deprivation regiments  and those studies  which date back to the '  s  are now being applied to human children. So I felt that I needed to do two things. One  provide care to children who are currently being deprived of treatment. That's the humanitarian mission. And the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity. And these two missions  as you can tell  thread together perfectly. One adds to the other  in fact  one would be impossible without the other. So  to implement these twin missions  a few years ago  I launched Project Prakash. Prakash  as many of you know  is the Sanskrit word for light  and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children  we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience. And the logo    even though it looks extremely Irish  it's actually derived from the Indian symbol of Diya  an earthen lamp. The Prakash  the overall effort has three components  outreach  to identify children in need of care  medical treatment  and in subsequent study. And I want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components of this work. This is an outreach station conducted at a school for the blind. Pawan Sinha  So  because this is a school for the blind  many children have permanent conditions. That's a case of microphthalmos  which is malformed eyes  and that's a permanent condition  it cannot be treated. That's an extreme of micropthalmos called enophthalmos. But  every so often  we come across children who show some residual vision  and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable. So  after that screening  we bring the children to the hospital. That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi  the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital. It has a very well equipped pediatric ophthalmic center  which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity. So  eating burgers actually helps. eye health in many children  and ... ... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.  PS  So  as I zoom in to the eyes of this child  you will see the cause of his blindness. The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts  so opacities of the lens. In our eyes  the lens is clear  but in this child  the lens has become opaque  and therefore he can't see the world. So  the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye. Here's the eye with the opaque lens  the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted. And here's the same child three weeks post operation  with the right eye open. Thank you. So  even from that little clip  you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible  and we have now provided treatment to over     children  and the story repeats itself. After treatment  the child gains significant functionality. In fact  the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation. We did a paper a few years ago about this woman that you see on the right  SRD  and she got her sight late in life  and her vision is remarkable at this age. I should add a tragic postscript to this    she died two years ago in a bus accident. So  hers is just a truly inspiring story    unknown  but inspiring story. So when we started finding these results  as you might imagine  it created quite a bit of stir in the scientific and the popular press. Here's an article in Nature that profiled this work  and another one in Time. So  we were fairly convinced    we are convinced    that recovery is feasible  despite extended visual deprivation. The next obvious question to ask  What is the process of recovery  So  the way we study that is  let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity. The child is provided treatment  and I want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional  there is no quid pro quo. We treat many more children then we actually work with. Every child who needs treatment is treated. After treatment  about every week  we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line. And we try to do this for as long as possible. This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up. What might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones  And we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies  but I want to highlight one particular one  and that is image parsing into objects. So  any image of the kind that you see on the left  be it a real image or a synthetic image  it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column  regions of different colors  different luminances. The brain has this complex task of putting together  integrating  subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful  into what we would consider to be objects  as you see on the right. And nobody knows how this integration happens  and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash. So  here's what happens very soon after the onset of sight. Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago  and you see Ethan Myers  a graduate student from MIT  running the experiment with him. His visual motor coordination is quite poor  but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out. If you show him real world images  if you show others like him real world images  they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over fragmented  it's made up of a collage  a patchwork  of regions of different colors and luminances. And that's what's indicated in the green outlines. When you ask them   Even if you can't name the objects  just point to where the objects are   these are the regions that they point to. So the world is this complex patchwork of regions. Even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object. Interestingly enough  you give them a few months  and this is what happens. Doctor  How many are these  Patient  These are two things. Doctor  What are their shapes  Patient  Their shapes ... This one is a circle  and this is a square. PS  A very dramatic transformation has come about. And the question is  What underlies this transformation  It's a profound question  and what's even more amazing is how simple the answer is. The answer lies in motion and that's what I want to show you in the next clip. Doctor  What shape do you see here  Patient  I can't make it out. Doctor  Now  Patient  Triangle. Doctor  How many things are these  Now  how many things are these  Patient  Two. Doctor  What are these things  Patient  A square and a circle. PS  And we see this pattern over and over again. The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information. So the inference we are deriving from this  and several such experiments  is that dynamic information processing  or motion processing  serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing  it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition. This simple idea has far reaching implications. And let me just quickly mention two  one  drawing from the domain of engineering  and one from the clinic. So  from the perspective of engineering  we can ask  Goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system  can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine based vision systems that can learn on their own  that don't need to be programmed by a human programmer  And that's what we're trying to do. I'm at MIT  at MIT you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain. So we are creating Dylan  which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive  and autonomously discovering  What are the objects in this visual input  So  don't worry about the internals of Dylan. Here  I'm just going to talk about how we test Dylan. The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs  as I said  of the same kind that a baby  or a child in Project Prakash would get. But for a long time we couldn't quite figure out  Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs  So  I thought  could we have Darius serve as our babycam carrier  and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan  So that's what we did. I had to have long conversations with my wife. In fact  Pam  if you're watching this  please forgive me. So  we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity. As some of you might know  babyies are born pretty much legally blind. Their acuity    our acuity is        babies' acuity is like         so they are looking at the world in a very  very blurry fashion. Here's what a baby cam video looks like. Thankfully  there isn't any audio to go with this. What's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input  the baby  very quickly  is able to discover meaning in such input. But then two or three days afterward  babies begin to pay attention to their mother's or their father's face. How does that happen  We want Dylan to be able to do that  and using this mantra of motion  Dylan actually can do that. So  given that kind of video input  with just about six or seven minutes worth of video  Dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces. So  it's an important demonstration of the power of motion. The clinical implication  it comes from the domain of autism. Visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers. When we saw that  we asked  Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath  of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism  Because  if that hypothesis were to be true  it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype. What you're going to see are video clips of two children    one neurotypical  one with autism  playing Pong. So  while the child is playing Pong  we are tracking where they're looking. In red are the eye movement traces. This is the neurotypical child  and what you see is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go. Even before the ball gets to a place  the child is already looking there. Contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game. Instead of anticipating  the child always follows where the ball has been. The efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism. So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we'll have more results to report soon. Looking ahead  if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we've treated so far  this is the magnitude of the problem. The red dots are the children we have not treated. So  there are many  many more children who need to be treated  and in order to expand the scope of the project  we are planning on launching The Prakash Center for Children  which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital  a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting edge research facility. The Prakash Center will integrate health care  education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts. So  to summarize  Prakash  in its five years of existence  it's had an impact in multiple areas  ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain  to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism  the development of autonomous machine vision systems  education of the undergraduate and graduate students  and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness. And for my students and I  it's been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research  while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with. Thank you very much.\n",

      "fish fisheries feed farm tuna fishing shrimp catch oceans wild\n",
      "So when I was a kid ... this was my team. I stunk at sports. I didn't like to play them  I didn't like to watch them. So this is what I did. I went fishing. And for all of my growing up I fished on the shores of Connecticut  and these are the creatures that I saw on a regular basis. But after I grew up and went to college  and I came home in the early   's  this is what I found. My team had shrunk. It was like literally having your roster devastated. And as I sort of looked into that  from a very personal point of view as a fisherman  I started to kind of figure out  well  what was the rest of the world thinking about it  First place I started to look was fish markets. And when I went to fish markets  in spite of where I was    whether I was in North Carolina  or Paris  or London  or wherever    I kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures  again and again    on the menus  on ice    shrimp  tuna  salmon and cod. And I thought this was pretty strange  and as I looked at it  I was wondering  did anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market  Well  when I looked into it  I realized that people didn't look at it as their team. Ordinary people  the way they looked at seafood was like this. It's not an unusual human characteristic to reduce the natural world down to very few elements. We did it before         years ago  when we came out of our caves. If you look at fire pits from        years ago  you'll see raccoons  you'll see  you know  wolves  you'll see all kinds of different creatures. But if you telescope to the age of    you know        years ago  you'll see these four mammals  pigs  cows  sheep and goats. It's true of birds  too. You look at the menus in New York City restaurants     years ago      years ago  you'll see snipe  woodcock  grouse  dozens of ducks  dozens of geese. But telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry  and you'll see four  turkeys  ducks  chicken and geese. So it makes sense that we've headed in this direction. But how have we headed in this direction  Well ... first it's a very  very new problem. This is the way we've been fishing the oceans over the last    years. World War II was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish. All of the technology that we perfected during World War II    sonar  lightweight polymers    all these things were redirected towards fish. And so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity  quadrupling in the course of time  from the end of World War II to the present time. And right now that means we're taking between    and    million metric tons out of the sea every year. That's the equivalent of the human weight of China taken out of the sea every year. And it's no coincidence that I use China as the example because China is now the largest fishing nation in the world. Well  that's only half the story. The other half of the story is this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture  which is now  only in the last year or two  starting to exceed the amount of wild fish that we produce. So that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together  you get the equivalent of two Chinas created from the ocean each and every year. And again  it's not a coincidence that I use China as the example  because China  in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish  is also the biggest farmer of fish. So let's look though at the four choices we are making right now. The first one    by far the most consumed seafood in America and in much of the West  is shrimp. Shrimp in the wild    as a wild product    is a terrible product.           pounds of wild fish are regularly killed to bring one pound of shrimp to the market. They're also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market. In a recent study that was produced out of Dalhousie University  it was found that dragging for shrimp is one of the most carbon intensive ways of fishing that you can find. So you can farm them  and people do farm them  and they farm them a lot in this very area. Problem is ... the place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats    in mangrove forests. Now look at those lovely roots coming down. Those are the things that hold soil together  protect coasts  create habitats for all sorts of young fish  young shrimp  all sorts of things that are important to this environment. Well  this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests. We've lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves over the last    or    years. That rate of destruction has slowed  but we're still in a major mangrove deficit. The other thing that's going on here is a phenomenon that the filmmaker Mark Benjamin called  Grinding Nemo.  This phenomenon is very  very relevant to anything that you've ever seen on a tropical reef. Because what's going on right now  we have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp  catching a huge amount of bycatch  that bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food. And sometimes  many of these vessels    manned by slaves    are catching these so called  trash fish   fish that we would love to see on a reef  grinding them up and turning them into shrimp feed    an ecosystem literally eating itself and spitting out shrimp. The next most consumed seafood in America  and also throughout the West  is tuna. So tuna is this ultimate global fish. These huge management areas have to be observed in order for tuna to be well managed. Our own management area  called a Regional Fisheries Management Organization  is called ICCAT  the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. The great naturalist Carl Safina once called it   The International Conspiracy to Catch all the Tunas.  Of course we've seen incredible improvement in ICCAT in the last few years  there is total room for improvement  but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish  and to manage it  we have to manage the globe. Well  we could also try to grow tuna but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture. Many people don't know this but tuna are warm blooded. They can heat their bodies    degrees above ambient temperature  they can swim at over    miles an hour. So that pretty much eliminates all the advantages of farming a fish  right  A farmed fish is    or a fish is cold blooded  it doesn't move too much. That's a great thing for growing protein. But if you've got this crazy  wild creature that swims at    miles an hour and heats its blood    not a great candidate for aquaculture. The next creature    most consumed seafood in America and throughout the West    is salmon. Now salmon got its plundering  too  but it didn't really necessarily happen through fishing. This is my home state of Connecticut. Connecticut used to be home to a lot of wild salmon. But if you look at this map of Connecticut  every dot on that map is a dam. There are over       dams in the state of Connecticut. I often say this is why people in Connecticut are so uptight    If somebody could just unblock Connecticut's chi  I feel that we could have an infinitely better world. But I made this particular comment at a convention once of national parks officers  and this guy from North Carolina sidled up to me  he says   You know  you oughtn't be so hard on your Connecticut  cause we here in North Carolina  we got        dams.  So it's a national epidemic  it's an international epidemic. And there are dams everywhere  and these are precisely the things that stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds. So as a result  we've turned to aquaculture  and salmon is one the most successful  at least from a numbers point of view. When they first started farming salmon  it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish to make a single pound of salmon. The industry has  to its credit  greatly improved. They've gotten it below two to one  although it's a little bit of a cheat because if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced  they're measuring pellets    pounds of pellets per pound of salmon. Those pellets are in turn reduced fish. So the actual    what's called the FIFO  the fish in and the fish out    kind of hard to say. But in any case  credit to the industry  it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon. Problem is we've also gone crazy with the amount of salmon that we're producing. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet. It's growing at something like seven percent per year. And so even though we're doing less per fish to bring it to the market  we're still killing a lot of these little fish. And it's not just fish that we're feeding fish to  we're also feeding fish to chickens and pigs. So we've got chickens and they're eating fish  but weirdly  we also have fish that are eating chickens. Because the byproducts of chickens    feathers  blood  bone    get ground up and fed to fish. So I often wonder  is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish  It's sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway    All together  though  it results in a terrible mess. What you're talking about is something between    and    million metric tons of wild creatures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up. That's the equivalent of a third of a China  or of an entire United States of humans that's taken out of the sea each and every year. The last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing. It's what the industry calls  whitefish.  There are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing but the way to kind of tell the story  I think  is through that classic piece of American culinary innovation  the Filet O Fish sandwich. So the Filet O Fish sandwich actually started as halibut. And it started because a local franchise owner found that when he served his McDonald's on Friday  nobody came. Because it was a Catholic community  they needed fish. So he went to Ray Kroc and he said   I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich  going to be made out of halibut.  Ray Kroc said   I don't think it's going to work. I want to do a Hula Burger  and there's going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun. But let's do this  let's have a bet. Whosever sandwich sells more  that will be the winning sandwich.  Well  it's kind of sad for the ocean that the Hula Burger didn't win. So he made his halibut sandwich. Unfortunately though  the sandwich came in at    cents. Ray wanted the sandwich to come in at    cents  so he turned to Atlantic cod. We all know what happened to Atlantic cod in New England. So now the Filet O Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pollock  it's the largest fin fish fishery in the United States    to   billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year. If we go through the pollock  the next choice is probably going to be tilapia. Tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of    years ago. It's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein  and it's been a godsend to the third world. It's actually a tremendously sustainable solution  it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months. The problem is that when you look about the West  it doesn't do what the West wants it to do. It really doesn't have what's called an oily fish profile. It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega  s that we all think are going to make us live forever. So what do we do  I mean  first of all  what about this poor fish  the clupeids  The fish that represent a huge part of that    to    million metric tons. Well  one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised is could we eat them  Could we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon  There are arguments for it. They are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market  a fraction of the fuel cost of say  shrimp  and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale. They also are omega   rich  a great source for EPA and DHA. So that is a potential. And if we were to go down that route what I would say is  instead of paying a few bucks a pound    or a few bucks a ton  really    and making it into aquafeed  could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen and make that our way of treating these particular fish  Other possibility though  which is much more interesting  is looking at bivalves  particularly mussels. Now  mussels are very high in EPA and DHA  they're similar to canned tuna. They're also extremely fuel efficient. To bring a pound of mussels to market is about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market. They require no forage fish  they actually get their omega  s by filtering the water of microalgae. In fact  that's where omega  s come from  they don't come from fish. Microalgae make the omega  s  they're only bioconcentrated in fish. Mussels and other bivalves do tremendous amounts of water filtration. A single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day. And this is incredibly important when we look at the world. Right now  nitrification  overuse of phosphates in our waterways are causing tremendous algal blooms. Over     new dead zones have been created in the last    years  tremendous sources of marine life death. We also could look at not a fish at all. We could look at a vegetable. We could look at seaweed  the kelps  all these different varieties of things that can be high in omega  s  can be high in proteins  tremendously good things. They filter the water just like mussels do. And weirdly enough  it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows. Now  I'm not a big fan of cattle. But if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and place where water resources are limited  you're growing seaweed in the water  you don't have to water it    major consideration. And the last fish is a question mark. We have the ability to create aquacultured fish that creates a net gain of marine protein for us. This creature would have to be vegetarian  it would have to be fast growing  it would have to be adaptable to a changing climate and it would have to have that oily fish profile  that EPA  DHA  omega   fatty acid profile that we're looking for. This exists kind of on paper. I have been reporting on these subjects for    years. Every time I do a new story  somebody tells me   We can do all that. We can do it. We've figured it all out. We can produce a fish that's a net gain of marine protein and has omega  s.  Great. It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up. It is time to scale this up. If we do     million metric tons of seafood  a third of the world catch  stays in the water. So I guess what I'm saying is this is what we've been going with. We tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds. But if we went with this  or some configuration of it  we might have a little more of this. Thank you.\n",
      "So  I've known a lot of fish in my life. I've loved only two. That first one  it was more like a passionate affair. It was a beautiful fish  flavorful  textured  meaty  a bestseller on the menu. What a fish. Even better  it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability. So you could feel good about selling it. I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months. One day  the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability.  Absolutely   I said. Here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs  How do we keep fish on our menus  For the past    years  we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests. It's hard to overstate the destruction. Ninety percent of large fish  the ones we love    the tunas  the halibuts  the salmons  swordfish    they've collapsed. There's almost nothing left. So  for better or for worse  aquaculture  fish farming  is going to be a part of our future. A lot of arguments against it  Fish farms pollute    most of them do anyway    and they're inefficient. Take tuna  a major drawback. It's got a feed conversion ratio of    to one. That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna. Not very sustainable. It doesn't taste very good either. So here  finally  was a company trying to do it right. I wanted to support them. The day before the event  I called the head of P.R. for the company. Let's call him Don.  Don   I said   just to get the facts straight  you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea  you don't pollute.   That's right   he said.  We're so far out  the waste from our fish gets distributed  not concentrated.  And then he added   We're basically a world unto ourselves. That feed conversion ratio   .  to one   he said.  Best in the business.   .  to one  great.   .  what  What are you feeding    Sustainable proteins   he said.  Great   I said. Got off the phone. And that night  I was lying in bed  and I thought  What the hell is a sustainable protein  So the next day  just before the event  I called Don. I said   Don  what are some examples of sustainable proteins   He said he didn't know. He would ask around. Well  I got on the phone with a few people in the company  no one could give me a straight answer until finally  I got on the phone with the head biologist. Let's call him Don too.  Don   I said   what are some examples of sustainable proteins   Well  he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals  and then he said chicken pellets. I said   Chicken pellets   He said   Yeah  feathers  skin  bone meal  scraps  dried and processed into feed.  I said   What percentage of your feed is chicken   Thinking  you know  two percent.  Well  it's about    percent   he said. I said   Don  what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish   There was a long pause on the line  and he said   There's just too much chicken in the world.  I fell out of love with this fish. No  not because I'm some self righteous  goody two shoes foodie. I actually am. No  I actually fell out of love with this fish because  I swear to God  after that conversation  the fish tasted like chicken. This second fish  it's a different kind of love story. It's the romantic kind  the kind where the more you get to know your fish  you love the fish. I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain. A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. She kind of set us up. It came to the table a bright  almost shimmering  white color. The chef had overcooked it. Like twice over. Amazingly  it was still delicious. Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked  I can't  but this guy can. Let's call him Miguel    actually his name is Miguel. And no  he didn't cook the fish  and he's not a chef  at least in the way that you and I understand it. He's a biologist at Veta La Palma. It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain. It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river. Until the     s  the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands. They did it by draining the land. They built this intricate series of canals  and they pushed water off the land and out into the river. Well  they couldn't make it work  not economically. And ecologically  it was a disaster. It killed like    percent of the birds  which  for this place  is a lot of birds. And so in       a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. What did they do  They reversed the flow of water. They literally flipped the switch. Instead of pushing water out  they used the channels to pull water back in. They flooded the canals. They created a        acre fish farm    bass  mullet  shrimp  eel    and in the process  Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction. The farm's incredible. I mean  you've never seen anything like this. You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away  and all you see are flooded canals and this thick  rich marshland. I was there not long ago with Miguel. He's an amazing guy  like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. Okay  There we are slogging through the wetlands  and I'm panting and sweating  got mud up to my knees  and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture. Here  he's pointing out a rare Black shouldered Kite. Now  he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton. And here  here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe. It turns out  Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. I asked him how he became such an expert on fish. He said   Fish  I didn't know anything about fish. I'm an expert in relationships.  And then he's off  launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants. And don't get me wrong  that was really fascinating  you know  the biotic community unplugged  kind of thing. It's great  but I was in love. And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. So I interrupted him. I said   Miguel  what makes your fish taste so good   He pointed at the algae.  I know  dude  the algae  the phytoplankton  the relationships  It's amazing. But what are your fish eating  What's the feed conversion ratio   Well  he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild. The plant biomass  the phytoplankton  the zooplankton  it's what feeds the fish. The system is so healthy  it's totally self renewing. There is no feed. Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals  Later that day  I was driving around this property with Miguel  and I asked him  I said   For a place that seems so natural  unlike like any farm I'd ever been at  how do you measure success   At that moment  it was as if a film director called for a set change. And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight  thousands and thousands of pink flamingos  a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.  That's success   he said.  Look at their bellies  pink. They're feasting.  Feasting  I was totally confused. I said   Miguel  aren't they feasting on your fish    Yes   he said.  We lose    percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds. Well  last year  this property had         birds on it  more than     different species. It's become  today  the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe.  I said   Miguel  isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm   He shook his head  no. He said   We farm extensively  not intensively. This is an ecological network. The flamingos eat the shrimp. The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. So the pinker the belly  the better the system.  Okay  so let's review  a farm that doesn't feed its animals  and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators. A fish farm  but also a bird sanctuary. Oh  and by the way  those flamingos  they shouldn't even be there in the first place. They brood in a town     miles away  where the soil conditions are better for building nests. Every morning  they fly     miles into the farm. And every evening  they fly     miles back. They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A  . No kidding. I was imagining a  March of the Penguins  thing  so I looked at Miguel. I said   Miguel  do they fly     miles to the farm  and then do they fly     miles back at night  Do they do that for the children   He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song. He said   No  they do it because the food's better.  I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish  which was delicious    and I don't like fish skin  I don't like it seared  I don't like it crispy. It's that acrid  tar like flavor. I almost never cook with it. Yet  when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain  it tasted not at all like fish skin. It tasted sweet and clean  like you were taking a bite of the ocean. I mentioned that to Miguel  and he nodded. He said   The skin acts like a sponge. It's the last defense before anything enters the body. It evolved to soak up impurities.  And then he added   But our water has no impurities.  OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish  a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators. And then I realized when he says   A farm that has no impurities   he made a big understatement  because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River. It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days  chemical contaminants  pesticide runoff. And when it works its way through the system and leaves  the water is cleaner than when it entered. The system is so healthy  it purifies the water. So  not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals  not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators  but a farm that's literally a water purification plant    and not just for those fish  but for you and me as well. Because when that water leaves  it dumps out into the Atlantic. A drop in the ocean  I know  but I'll take it  and so should you  because this love story  however romantic  is also instructive. You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food  whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle. What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture  one in which the food actually tastes good. But for a lot people  that's a bit too radical. We're not realists  us foodies  we're lovers. We love farmers' markets  we love small family farms  we talk about local food  we eat organic. And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food  someone  somewhere stands up and says   Hey guy  I love pink flamingos  but how are you going to feed the world   How are you going to feed the world  Can I be honest  I don't love that question. No  not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world. One billion people will go hungry today. One billion    that's more than ever before    because of gross inequalities in distribution  not tonnage. Now  I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last    years. Feed grain to herbivores  pesticides to monocultures  chemicals to soil  chicken to fish  and all along agribusiness has simply asked   If we're feeding more people more cheaply  how terrible could that be   That's been the motivation  it's been the justification  it's been the business plan of American agriculture. We should call it what it is  a business in liquidation  a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible. That's not a business  and it isn't agriculture. Our breadbasket is threatened today  not because of diminishing supply  but because of diminishing resources. Not by the latest combine and tractor invention  but by fertile land  not by pumps  but by fresh water  not by chainsaws  but by forests  and not by fishing boats and nets  but by fish in the sea. Want to feed the world  Let's start by asking  How are we going to feed ourselves  Or better  How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself  To do that  don't look at the agribusiness model for the future. It's really old  and it's tired. It's high on capital  chemistry and machines  and it's never produced anything really good to eat. Instead  let's look to the ecological model. That's the one that relies on two billion years of on the job experience. Look to Miguel  farmers like Miguel. Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves  farms that restore instead of deplete  farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively  farmers that are not just producers  but experts in relationships. Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor  too. And if I'm going to be really honest  they're a better chef than I'll ever be. You know  I'm okay with that  because if that's the future of good food  it's going to be delicious. Thank you.\n",
      "You may be wondering why a marine biologist from Oceana would come here today to talk to you about world hunger. I'm here today because saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire. It's more than a thing we're doing because we want to create jobs for fishermen or preserve fishermen's jobs. It's more than an economic pursuit. Saving the oceans can feed the world. Let me show you how. As you know  there are already more than a billion hungry people on this planet. We're expecting that problem to get worse as world population grows to nine billion or    billion by midcentury  and we can expect to have greater pressure on our food resources. And this is a big concern  especially considering where we are now. Now we know that our arable land per capita is already on the decline in both developed and developing countries. We know that we're headed for climate change  which is going to change rainfall patterns  making some areas drier  as you can see in orange  and others wetter  in blue  causing droughts in our breadbaskets  in places like the Midwest and Central Europe  and floods in others. It's going to make it harder for the land to help us solve the hunger problem. And that's why the oceans need to be their most abundant  so that the oceans can provide us as much food as possible. And that's something the oceans have been doing for us for a long time. As far back as we can go  we've seen an increase in the amount of food we've been able to harvest from our oceans. It just seemed like it was continuing to increase  until about       when we started to see a decline. You've heard of peak oil. Maybe this is peak fish. I hope not. I'm going to come back to that. But you can see about an    percent decline in the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch since     . And this is a big problem. It's continuing. This red line is continuing to go down. But we know how to turn it around  and that's what I'm going to talk about today. We know how to turn that curve back upwards. This doesn't have to be peak fish. If we do a few simple things in targeted places  we can bring our fisheries back and use them to feed people. First we want to know where the fish are  so let's look where the fish are. It turns out the fish  conveniently  are located for the most part in our coastal areas of the countries  in coastal zones  and these are areas that national jurisdictions have control over  and they can manage their fisheries in these coastal areas. Coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions that go out about     nautical miles  in areas that are called exclusive economic zones  and this is a good thing that they can control their fisheries in these areas  because the high seas  which are the darker areas on this map  the high seas  it's a lot harder to control things  because it has to be done internationally. You get into international agreements  and if any of you are tracking the climate change agreement  you know this can be a very slow  frustrating  tedious process. And so controlling things nationally is a great thing to be able to do. How many fish are actually in these coastal areas compared to the high seas  Well  you can see here about seven times as many fish in the coastal areas than there are in the high seas  so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing  because we can actually get a lot done. We can restore a lot of our fisheries if we focus in these coastal areas. But how many of these countries do we have to work in  There's something like    coastal countries. Do we have to fix fisheries management in all of those countries  So we asked ourselves  how many countries do we need to focus on  keeping in mind that the European Union conveniently manages its fisheries through a common fisheries policy  So if we got good fisheries management in the European Union and  say  nine other countries  how much of our fisheries would we be covering  Turns out  European Union plus nine countries covers about two thirds of the world's fish catch. If we took it up to    countries plus the European Union  we would up to    percent  almost all of the world's fish catch. So we think we can work in a limited number of places to make the fisheries come back. But what do we have to do in these places  Well  based on our work in the United States and elsewhere  we know that there are three key things we have to do to bring fisheries back  and they are  We need to set quotas or limits on how much we take  we need to reduce bycatch  which is the accidental catching and killing of fish that we're not targeting  and it's very wasteful  and three  we need to protect habitats  the nursery areas  the spawning areas that these fish need to grow and reproduce successfully so that they can rebuild their populations. If we do those three things  we  know the fisheries will come back. How do we know  We know because we've seen it happening in a lot of different places. This is a slide that shows the herring population in Norway that was crashing since the     s. It was coming down  and when Norway set limits  or quotas  on its fishery  what happens  The fishery comes back. This is another example  also happens to be from Norway  of the Norwegian Arctic cod. Same deal. The fishery is crashing. They set limits on discards. Discards are these fish they weren't targeting and they get thrown overboard wastefully. When they set the discard limit  the fishery came back. And it's not just in Norway. We've seen this happening in countries all around the world  time and time again. When these countries step in and they put in sustainable fisheries management policies  the fisheries  which are always crashing  it seems  are starting to come back. So there's a lot of promise here. What does this mean for the world fish catch  This means that if we take that fishery catch that's on the decline and we could turn it upwards  we could increase it up to     million metric tons per year. So we didn't have peak fish yet. We still have an opportunity to not only bring the fish back but to actually get more fish that can feed more people than we currently are now. How many more  Right about now  we can feed about     million people a fish meal a day based on the current world fish catch  which  of course  you know is going down  so that number will go down over time if we don't fix it  but if we put fishery management practices like the ones I've described in place in    to    countries  we could bring that number up and feed as many as     million people a year a healthy fish meal. We should obviously do this just because it's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem  but it's also cost effective. It turns out fish is the most cost effective protein on the planet. If you look at how much fish protein you get per dollar invested compared to all of the other animal proteins  obviously  fish is a good business decision. It also doesn't need a lot of land  something that's in short supply  compared to other protein sources. And it doesn't need a lot of fresh water. It uses a lot less fresh water than  for example  cattle  where you have to irrigate a field so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle. It also has a very low carbon footprint. It has a little bit of a carbon footprint because we do have to get out and catch the fish. It takes a little bit of fuel  but as you know  agriculture can have a carbon footprint  and fish has a much smaller one  so it's less polluting. It's already a big part of our diet  but it can be a bigger part of our diet  which is a good thing  because we know that it's healthy for us. It can reduce our risks of cancer  heart disease and obesity. In fact  our CEO Andy Sharpless  who is the originator of this concept  actually  he likes to say fish is the perfect protein. Andy also talks about the fact that our ocean conservation movement really grew out of the land conservation movement  and in land conservation  we have this problem where biodiversity is at war with food production. You have to cut down the biodiverse forest if you want to get the field to grow the corn to feed people with  and so there's a constant push pull there. There's a constant tough decision that has to be made between two very important things  maintaining biodiversity and feeding people. But in the oceans  we don't have that war. In the oceans  biodiversity is not at war with abundance. In fact  they're aligned. When we do things that produce biodiversity  we actually get more abundance  and that's important so that we can feed people. Now  there's a catch. Didn't anyone get that   Laughter  Illegal fishing. Illegal fishing undermines the type of sustainable fisheries management I'm talking about. It can be when you catch fish using gears that have been prohibited  when you fish in places where you're not supposed to fish  you catch fish that are the wrong size or the wrong species. Illegal fishing cheats the consumer and it also cheats honest fishermen  and it needs to stop. The way illegal fish get into our  market is through seafood fraud. You might have heard about this. It's when fish are labeled as something they're not. Think about the last time you had fish. What were you eating  Are you sure that's what it was  Because we tested       different fish samples and about a third of them were not what they were labeled to be. Snappers  nine out of    snappers were not snapper. Fifty nine percent of the tuna we tested was mislabeled. And red snapper  we tested     samples  and only seven of them were really red snapper  so good luck finding a red snapper. Seafood has a really complex supply chain  and at every step in this supply chain  there's an opportunity for seafood fraud  unless we have traceability. Traceability is a way where the seafood industry can track the seafood from the boat to the plate to make sure that the consumer can then find out where their seafood came from. This is a really important thing. It's being done by some in the industry  but not enough  so we're pushing a law in Congress called the SAFE Seafood Act  and I'm very excited today to announce the release of a chef's petition  where     chefs have signed a petition calling on Congress to support the SAFE Seafood Act. It has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know    Anthony Bourdain  Mario Batali  Barton Seaver and others   and they've signed it because they believe that people have a right to know about what they're eating. Fishermen like it too  so there's a good chance we can get the kind of support we need to get this bill through  and it comes at a critical time  because this is the way we stop seafood fraud  this is the way we curb illegal fishing  and this is the way we make sure that quotas  habitat protection  and bycatch reductions can do the jobs they can do. We know that we can manage our fisheries sustainably. We know that we can produce healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people that don't use the land  that don't use much water  have a low carbon footprint  and are cost effective. We know that saving the oceans can feed the world  and we need to start now. Thank you.  Applause \n",
      "So I come from the tallest people on the planet    the Dutch. It hasn't always been this way. In fact  all across the globe  people have been gaining height. In the last     years  in developed countries  on average  we have gotten    centimeters taller. And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is  but almost all of them involve nutrition  namely the increase of dairy and meat. In the last    years  global meat consumption has more than quadrupled  from    million tons to     million tons. Something similar has been going on with milk and eggs. In every society where incomes have risen  so has protein consumption. And we know that globally  we are getting richer. And as the middle class is on the rise  so is our global population  from   billion of us today to  .  billion by       which means that by       we are going to need at least    percent more protein than what is available to humankind today. And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number  by the end of this century  at    billion  which means that we are going to need a lot more protein. This challenge is staggering    so much so  that recently  a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested that if we don't change our global policies and food production systems  our societies might actually collapse in the next    years. Currently  our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein. Over  .  billion people depend on it every single day. At the same time  our global fisheries are two and a half times larger than what our oceans can sustainably support  meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean than the oceans can naturally replace. WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last    years  our global marine life has been slashed in half. And another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species  such as swordfish and bluefin tuna  over    percent has disappeared since the     s. And there are a lot of great  sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet working towards better practices and better managed fisheries. But ultimately  all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant. It's unlikely  even with the best managed fisheries  that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean than we do today. We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have. We need to alleviate the pressure on it. And we are at a point where if we push much harder for more produce  we might face total collapse. Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population. So how do we fix this  What's the world going to look like in just    short years when there's  .  billion more of us sharing the same resources  We could all become vegan. Sounds like a great idea  but it's not realistic and it's impossibly hard to mandate globally. People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not. And suppose we fail to change our ways and continue on the current path  failing to meet demands. The World Health Organization recently reported that     million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage  which is due to that same growing  global population and the declining access to resources like water  energy and land. It takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest  riots and further malnutrition. People are hungry  and we are running dangerously low on natural resources. For so  so many reasons  we need to change our global food production systems. We must do better and there is a solution. And that solution lies in aquaculture    the farming of fish  plants like seaweed  shellfish and crustaceans. As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said   We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters. That's what civilization is all about    farming instead of hunting.  Fish is the last food that we hunt. And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like   Life's too short for farmed fish   or   Wild caught  of course   over fish that we know virtually nothing about  We don't know what it ate during its lifetime  and we don't know what pollution it encounters. And if it was a large predatory species  it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday. We don't know. Very few people realize the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal. But let's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice. It's healthy  it prevents heart disease  it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like Omega  s  which is very different from almost any other type of meat. And aside from being healthy  it's also a lot more exciting and diverse. Think about it    most animal farming is pretty monotonous. Cow is cow  sheep is sheep  pig's pig  and poultry    turkey  duck  chicken    pretty much sums it up. And then there's     species of fish being farmed currently. not that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves  but that's beside that point. And you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that's good for us  good for the planet and good for the fish. I know I sound fish obsessed    Let me explain  My brilliant partner and wife  Amy Novograntz  and I got involved in aquaculture a couple of years ago. We were inspired by Sylvia Earle  who won the TED Prize in     . We actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos. Amy was there as the TED Prize Director  me  an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen  love to dive  passion for the oceans. Mission Blue truly changed our lives. We fell in love  got married and we came away really inspired  thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation    something that was meant to last  that could make a real difference and something that we could do together. Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming. But a few months after we got off the boat  we got to a meeting at Conservation International  where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture  asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it  realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture has the potential to be just what our oceans and populations need. We were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn't know more about this industry already and excited about the chance to help get it right. And to talk about stats    right now  the amount of fish consumed globally  wild catch and farmed combined  is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef produced on planet earth last year. Every single fishing vessel combined  small and large  across the globe  together produce about    million tons of wild caught seafood for human consumption. Aquaculture this year  for the first time in history  actually produces more than what we catch from the wild. But now this  Demand is going to go up. In the next    years  we are going to need an additional    million tons to meet demand  which is one and a half times as much  almost  as what we catch globally out of our oceans. An enormous number. It's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean. It needs to come from farming. And talk about farming    for farming you need resources. As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive  so does an animal. A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost       liters of water to create just one pound of meat. Experts agree that it's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet. We just don't have enough feed or water. And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it. And fresh water    planet earth has a very limited supply. We need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet. And now let's compare that with fish farming. You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed  and depending on species  even less. And why is that  Well  that's because fish  first of all  float. They don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do. And most fish are cold blooded    they don't need to heat themselves. Fish chills. And it needs very little water  which is counterintuitive  but as we say  it swims in it but it hardly drinks it. Fish are the most resource efficient animal protein available to humankind  aside from insects. How much we've learned since. For example  on top of that    million tons that's annually caught for human consumption  there's an additional    million tons caught for animal feed  mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry that's turned into fish meal and fish oil. This is madness. Sixty five percent of these fisheries  globally  are badly managed. Some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it. It's destroying our oceans. The worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it. Recently  an article came out of Stanford saying that if    percent of the world's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal  our oceans would be saved. Now think about that for a minute. Now  we know that the oceans have far more problems    they have pollution  there's acidification  coral reef destruction and so on. But it underlines the impact of our fisheries  and it underlines how interconnected everything is. Fisheries  aquaculture  deforestation  climate change  food security and so on. In the search for alternatives  the industry  on a massive scale  has reverted to plant based alternatives like soy  industrial chicken waste  blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on. And we understand where these choices come from  but this is not the right approach. It's not sustainable  it's not healthy. Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean  Of course not. If you feed salmon soy with nothing else  it literally explodes. Salmon is a carnivore  it has no way to digest soy. Now  fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind. But it's had a really bad reputation. There's been excessive use of chemicals  there's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations  ecosystem destruction and pollution  escaped fish breeding with wild populations  altering the overall genetic pool  and then of course  as just mentioned  the unsustainable feed ingredients. How blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate  whatever it was. Once you know  you know. You can't go back. It's not fun. We really need a transparent food system that we can trust  that produces healthy food. But the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better. We can now farm fish without any of these issues. I think of agriculture before the green revolution    we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution. New technologies means that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural  with a minimal footprint that consists of microbes  insects  seaweeds and micro algae. Healthy for the people  healthy for the fish  healthy for the planet. Microbes  for example  can be a perfect alternative for high grade fish meal    at scale. Insects are the    well  first of all  the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste  but second  think of fly fishing  and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed. You don't need large tracts of land for it and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it. And microbes and insects are actually net water producers. This revolution is starting as we speak  it just needs scale. We can now farm far more species than ever before in controlled  natural conditions  creating happy fish. I imagine  for example  a closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming  where you can produce healthy  happy  delicious fish with little or no effluent  almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint. Or a system where you grow up to    species next to each other    off of each other  mimicking nature. You need very little feed  very little footprint. I think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish  for example. There's great technologies popping up all over the globe. From alternatives to battle disease so we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore  to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry  so we can save on feed and create less pollution. Software systems that gather data across farms  so we can improve farm practices. There's really cool stuff happening all over the globe. And make no mistake    all of these things are possible at a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today. Tomorrow  there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing. So somebody needs to connect the dots and give these developments a big kick in the butt. And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years  and that's what we need to be working on together    rethinking everything from the ground up  with a holistic view across the value chain  connecting all these things across the globe  alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision. Now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction. This industry is still young  much of its growth is still ahead. It's a big task  but not as far fetched as you might think. It's possible. So we need to take pressure off the ocean. We want to eat good and healthy. And if we eat an animal  it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life. We need to have a meal that we can trust  live long lives. And this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe    this is for all of us. Even in the poorest countries  it's not just about money. People prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about. We're all the same. The day will come where people will realize    no  demand    farmed fish on their plate that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy    and refuse anything less. You can help speed this up. Ask questions when you order seafood. Where does my fish come from  Who raised it  and what did it eat  Information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available. And consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing. So every time you order  ask for detail and show that you really care about what you eat and what's been given to you. And eventually  they will listen. And all of us will benefit. Thank you.\n",
      "I'm going to speak about a tiny  little idea. And this is about shifting baseline. And because the idea can be explained in one minute  I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time. And the first story is about Charles Darwin  one of my heroes. And he was here  as you well know  in '  . And you'd think he was chasing finches  but he wasn't. He was actually collecting fish. And he described one of them as very  common.  This was the sailfin grouper. A big fishery was run on it until the '  s. Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List. Now this story  we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places  so there is nothing particular about it. But the point is  we still come to Galapagos. We still think it is pristine. The brochures still say it is untouched. So what happens here  The second story  also to illustrate another concept  is called shifting waistline. Because I was there in '    studying a lagoon in West Africa. I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa. And I thought I could blend in. And I got a big sunburn  and I was convinced that I was really not from there. This was my first sunburn. And the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees  as you can see  and a few mangrove. And it had tilapia about    centimeters  a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia. And the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana. When I went there    years later  the fish had shrunk to half of their size. They were maturing at five centimeters. They had been pushed genetically. There were still fishes. They were still kind of happy. And the fish also were happy to be there. So nothing has changed  but everything has changed. My third little story is that I was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in Southeast Asia. In the '  s    well  beginning in the '  s    Europe did lots of development projects. Fish development meant imposing on countries that had already         fishers to impose on them industrial fishing. And this boat  quite ugly  is called the Mutiara  . And I went sailing on it  and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea. And what we caught  we didn't have words for it. What we caught  I know now  is the bottom of the sea. And    percent of our catch were sponges  other animals that are fixed on the bottom. And actually most of the fish  they are a little spot on the debris  the piles of debris  were coral reef fish. Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down. And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid. Within a year  you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins. The bottom is transformed from  in this case  a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess. This is a dead turtle. They were not eaten  they were thrown away because they were dead. And one time we caught a live one. It was not drowned yet. And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat. This mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that's never been fished. But it's not documented. We transform the world  but we don't remember it. We adjust our baseline to the new level  and we don't recall what was there. If you generalize this  something like this happens. You have on the y axis some good thing  biodiversity  numbers of orca  the greenness of your country  the water supply. And over time it changes    it changes because people do things  or naturally. Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward. And the difference then  they perceive as a loss. But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss. You can have a succession of changes. At the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers. And that  to a large extent  is what we want to do now. We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were. Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies  they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations. Because  obviously  an animal that is very abundant  before it gets extinct  it becomes rare. So you don't lose abundant animals. You always lose rare animals. And therefore they're not perceived as a big loss. Over time  we concentrate on large animals  and in a sea that means the big fish. They become rarer because we fish them. Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline. And the question is  why do people accept this  Well because they don't know that it was different. And in fact  lots of people  scientists  will contest that it was really different. And they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented. For example  the anecdote that some present  as Captain so and so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists  because it's not  scientific.  So you have a situation where people don't know the past  even though we live in literate societies  because they don't trust the sources of the past. And hence  the enormous role that a marine protected area can play. Because with marine protected areas  we actually recreate the past. We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low. That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides  which enables them to reset their baseline. How about the people who can't do that because they have no access    the people in the Midwest for example  There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap  and simulation. This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay. There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago        years ago. And you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like  Avatar.  And if you think about  Avatar   if you think of why people were so touched by it    never mind the Pocahontas story    why so touched by the imagery  Because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost. And so my recommendation  it's the only one I will provide  is for Cameron to do  Avatar II  underwater. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk  I was really chuckled  because  you see  my father's name was Ted  and much of my life  especially my musical life  is really a talk that I'm still having with him  or the part of me that he continues to be. Now Ted was a New Yorker  an all around theater guy  and he was a self taught illustrator and musician. He didn't read a note  and he was profoundly hearing impaired. Yet  he was my greatest teacher. Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids  his understanding of music was profound. And for him  it wasn't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you. And he did a painting of this experience  which he called  In the Realm of Music.  Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this. But he was tough when it came to music. He said   There are only two things that matter in music  what and how. And the thing about classical music  that what and how  it's inexhaustible.  That was his passion for the music. Both my parents really loved it. They didn't know all that much about it  but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them. And I think inspired by that memory  it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can  sort of pass it on through whatever means. And how people get this music  how it comes into their lives  really fascinates me. One day in New York  I was on the street and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants. And a tough  slouchy kid got up to bat  and he took a swing and really connected. And he watched the ball fly for a second  and then he went   Dah dadaratatatah. Brah dada dadadadah.  And he ran around the bases. And I thought  go figure. How did this piece of   th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment turn into the victory crow of this New York kid  How was that passed on  How did he get to hear Mozart  Well when it comes to classical music  there's an awful lot to pass on  much more than Mozart  Beethoven or Tchiakovsky. Because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over       years. And every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it's like to be alive. Now the raw material of it  of course  is just the music of everyday life. It's all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches. But what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down  to condense them to their absolute essence  and from that essence create a new language  a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are. It's a language that's still evolving. Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of  like concertos and symphonies  but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment    like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto. It's so simple  so evocative. So many emotions seem to be inside of it. Yet  of course  like all music  it's essentially not about anything. It's just a design of pitches and silence and time. And the pitches  the notes  as you know  are just vibrations. They're locations in the spectrum of sound. And whether we call them     per second  A  or        B flat    trust me  that's right    they're just phenomena. But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood. And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries  as have our preferences for them. So for example  in the   th century  people liked pieces that ended like this. And in the   th century  it was more like this. And in the   st century ... Now your   st century ears are quite happy with this last chord  even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room. And the reason you like it is because you've inherited  whether you knew it or not  centuries worth of changes in musical theory  practice and fashion. And in classical music we can follow these changes very  very accurately because of the music's powerful silent partner  the way it's been passed on  notation. Now the impulse to notate  or  more exactly I should say  encode music has been with us for a very long time. In     B.C.  a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks. And a thousand years later  this impulse to notate took an entirely different form. And you can see how this happened in these excerpts from the Christmas mass  Puer Natus est nobis    For Us is Born.  In the   th century  little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune. And in the   th century  a line was drawn  like a musical horizon line  to better pinpoint the pitch's location. And then in the   th century  more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly  and that led to the kind of notation we have today. Well notation not only passed the music on  notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely  because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale. Now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded  saved  considered  prioritized  made into intricate designs. And from this moment  classical music became what it most essentially is  a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature  instinct and intelligence. And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition. Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move  but a composer is considering all possible moves  testing them out  prioritizing them out  until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness. Now some of the greatest composers  like Bach  were combinations of these two things. Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master. Mozart was the same way. But every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason  instinct and intelligence. And every musical era had different priorities of these things  different things to pass on  different 'whats' and 'hows'. So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise God. And by the     s  music was being written that tried to mirror God's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky. The 'how' was a style called polyphony  music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in Ptolemy's geocentric universe. This was truly the music of the spheres. This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known. And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen    a radical new move  which in      is what did happen. Ah  wicked  cruel fate  Ah  baleful stars  Ah  avaricious heaven  MTT  This  of course  was the birth of opera  and its development put music on a radical new course. The what now was not to mirror the mind of God  but to follow the emotion turbulence of man. And the how was harmony  stacking up the pitches to form chords. And the chords  it turned out  were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions. And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us  the triads  either the major one  which we think is happy  or the minor one  which we perceive as sad. But what's the actual difference between these two chords  It's just these two notes in the middle. It's either E natural  and     vibrations per second  or E flat  at    . So the big difference between human happiness and sadness     freakin' vibrations. So you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions. And in fact  as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature  harmony grew more complex to reflect it. Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words. Now with all this possibility  classical music really took off. It's the time in which the big forms began to arise. And the effects of technology began to be felt also  because printing put music  the scores  the codebooks of music  into the hands of performers everywhere. And new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible. This is when those big forms arose    the symphonies  the sonatas  the concertos. And in these big architectures of time  composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime. A piece like Beethoven's Fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger  over the course of a half an hour  step by exacting step of his route  to the moment when he could make it across to joy. And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues  like gripping ones of culture  such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality. But whatever direction the music took  one thing until recently was always the same  and that was when the musicians stopped playing  the music stopped. Now this moment so fascinates me. I find it such a profound one. What happens when the music stops  Where does it go  What's left  What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance  Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude  And how might that change their lives  To me this is the intimate  personal side of music. It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it. And to me that's the most essential of all. Mostly it's been a person to person thing  a teacher student  performer audience thing  and then around      came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new and miraculous way of passing things on  albeit an impersonal one. People could now hear music all the time  even though it wasn't necessary for them to play an instrument  read music or even go to concerts. And technology democratized music by making everything available. It spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing. And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes  using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences. At the same time technology  by taking over the role that notation had always played  shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side. The culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that's been sliced  diced  layered and  God knows  distributed and sold. What's the long term effect of this on us or on music  Nobody knows. The question remains  What happens when the music stops  What sticks with people  Now that we have unlimited access to music  what does stick with us  Well let me show you a story of what I mean by  really sticking with us.  I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home  and I spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker. He came over to a piano that was there  and he balanced himself and began playing something like this. And he said something like   Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven.  And I suddenly got it  and I said   Friend  by any chance are you trying to play this   And he said   Yes  yes. I was a little boy. The symphony  Isaac Stern  the concerto  I heard it.  And I thought  my God  how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed  across the room to recover the memory of this music that  after everything else in his life is sloughing away  still means so much to him  Well  that's why I take every performance so seriously  why it matters to me so much. I never know who might be there  who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life. But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music. That's what drives my interest in projects like the TV series  Keeping Score  with the San Francisco Symphony that looks at the backstories of music  and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education. And of course  the New World Symphony led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world. And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype. There's just a role here for so many people    teachers  parents  performers    to be explorers together. Sure  the big events attract a lot of attention  but what really matters is what goes on every single day. We need your perspectives  your curiosity  your voices. And it excites me now to meet people who are hikers  chefs  code writers  taxi drivers  people I never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on. You don't need to worry about knowing anything. If you're curious  if you have a capacity for wonder  if you're alive  you know all that you need to know. You can start anywhere. Ramble a bit. Follow traces. Get lost. Be surprised  amused inspired. All that 'what'  all that 'how' is out there waiting for you to discover its 'why'  to dive in and pass it on. Thank you.\n",
      "This is the venue where  as a young man  some of the music that I wrote was first performed. It was  remarkably  a pretty good sounding room. With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere  it actually sounded pretty good. This is a song that was recorded there. This is not Talking Heads  in the picture anyway. So the nature of the room meant that words could be understood. The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood. The sound system was kind of decent. And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room. So the rhythms could be pretty intact too  pretty concise. Other places around the country had similar rooms. This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville. The music was in some ways different  but in structure and form  very much the same. The clientele behavior was very much the same too. And so the bands at Tootsie's or at CBGB's had to play loud enough    the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down  shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing. Since then  I've played other places that are much nicer. I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that. And it's been very exciting. But I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written  or was writing at the time  didn't sound all that great in some of those halls. We managed  but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made. So I asked myself  Do I write stuff for specific rooms  Do I have a place  a venue  in mind when I write  Is that a kind of model for creativity  Do we all make things with a venue  a context  in mind  Okay  Africa. Most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa. And the music there  I would say  the instruments  the intricate rhythms  the way it's played  the setting  the context  it's all perfect. It all works perfect. The music works perfectly in that setting. There's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms. The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification  etc.  etc. It's no accident. It's perfect for that particular context. And it would be a mess in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral. In a gothic cathedral  this kind of music is perfect. It doesn't change key  the notes are long  there's almost no rhythm whatsoever  and the room flatters the music. It actually improves it. This is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for. This is the organ. It's not as big as a gothic cathedral  so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate. He can  very innovatively  actually change keys without risking huge dissonances. This is a little bit later. This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in. I think we're in like       somewhere around there. They're smaller  even less reverberant  so he can write really frilly music that's very intricate    and it works. It fits the room perfectly. This is La Scala. It's around the same time  I think it was built around     . People in the audience in these opera houses  when they were built  they used to yell out to one another. They used to eat  drink and yell out to people on the stage  just like they do at CBGB's and places like that. If they liked an aria  they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore  not at the end of the show  but immediately. And well  that was an opera experience. This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself. And the size of the room is not that big. It's smaller than this. But Wagner made an innovation. He wanted a bigger band. He wanted a little more bombast  so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low end instruments in there. Okay. This is Carnegie Hall. Obviously  this kind of thing became popular. The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair sized. It's larger than some of the other symphony halls. And they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala. Around the same  according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker  this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet    no more eating  drinking and yelling at the stage  or gossiping with one another during the show. They had to be very quiet. So those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls. It meant that there could be extreme dynamics  which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music. Quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting. But because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall  the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural. This is Mahler. It looks like Bob Dylan  but it's Mahler. That was Bob's last record  yeah. Popular music  coming along at the same time. This is a jazz band. According to Scott Joplin  the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs. Again  it's noisy. They're playing for dancers. There's certain sections of the song    the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked. And they'd say   Play that part again.  Well  there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers. So the bands started to improvise new melodies. And a new form of music was born. These are played mainly in small rooms. People are dancing  shouting and drinking. So the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that. Same thing goes true for    that's the beginning of the century    for the whole of   th century popular music  whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.  Live music  doesn't really change that much. It changes about a third of the way into the   th century  when this became one of the primary venues for music. And this was one way that the music got there. Microphones enabled singers  in particular  and musicians and composers  to completely change the kind of music that they were writing. So far  a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music  but singers  like Frank Sinatra  could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone. Other singers after him went even further. This is Chet Baker. And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone. It would have been impossible without recorded music as well. And he's singing right into your ear. He's whispering into your ears. The effect is just electric. It's like the guy is sitting next to you  whispering who knows what into your ear. So at this point  music diverged. There's live music  and there's recorded music. And they no longer have to be exactly the same. Now there's venues like this  a discotheque  and there's jukeboxes in bars  where you don't even need to have a band. There doesn't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever  and the sound systems are good. People began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems. And  as with jazz  the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others. So the early hip hop guys would loop certain sections. The MC would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies. And another new form of music was born. Live performance  when it was incredibly successful  ended up in what is probably  acoustically  the worst sounding venues on the planet  sports stadiums  basketball arenas and hockey arenas. Musicians who ended up there did the best they could. They wrote what is now called arena rock  which is medium speed ballads. They did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for. The tempos are medium. It sounds big. It's more a social situation than a musical situation. And in some ways  the music that they're writing for this place works perfectly. So there's more new venues. One of the new ones is the automobile. I grew up with a radio in a car. But now that's evolved into something else. The car is a whole venue. The music that  I would say  is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it. It might not be what you want to listen to at home  but it works great in the car    has a huge frequency spectrum  you know  big bass and high end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle. Automobile music  you can share with your friends. There's one other kind of new venue  the private MP  player. Presumably  this is just for Christian music. And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall  or when the audience had to hush up  because you can now hear every single detail. In other ways  it's more like the West African music because if the music in an MP  player gets too quiet  you turn it up  and the next minute  your ears are blasted out by a louder passage. So that doesn't really work. I think pop music  mainly  it's written today  to some extent  is written for these kind of players  for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail  but the dynamic doesn't change that much. So I asked myself  Okay  is this a model for creation  this adaptation that we do  And does it happen anywhere else  Well  according to David Attenborough and some other people  birds do it too    that the birds in the canopy  where the foliage is dense  their calls tend to be high pitched  short and repetitive. And the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls  so that they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor. And birds like this Savannah sparrow  they tend to have a buzzing type call. And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs. Other birds  like this tanager  have adapted within the same species. The tananger on the East Coast of the United States  where the forests are a little denser  has one kind of call  and the tananger on the other side  on the west has a different kind of call. So birds do it too. And I thought  Well  if this is a model for creation  if we make music  primarily the form at least  to fit these contexts  and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls  and if we write software to fit existing operating systems  is that how it works  Yeah. I think it's evolutionary. It's adaptive. But the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there. This is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional Romantic view. The Romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion  and then somehow it gets shaped into something. And I'm saying  well  the passion's still there  but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into  that is instinctively and intuitively created first. We already know where that passion is going. But this conflict of views is kind of interesting. The writer  Thomas Frank  says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests  that voters  like a lot of us  assume  that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere  that it's coming from the gut  that it's passionate  that it's more authentic. And they'll vote for that. So that  if somebody can fake sincerity  if they can fake passion  they stand a better chance of being selected in that way  which seems a little dangerous. I'm saying the two  the passion  the joy  are not mutually exclusive. Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds. We adapt. We sing. And like the birds  the joy is still there  even though we have changed what we do to fit the context. Thank you very much.\n",
      "The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us. But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it  but you make it yourself. So  that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect    the idea that's been around for the last five to    years    that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby  in utero   that it'll raise our IQ points            percent. Great idea  but it doesn't work at all. So  you can't just listen to music  you have to make it somehow. And I'd add to that  that it's not just making it  but everybody  each of us  everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way  and that's one of the main parts of my work. So  with the MIT Media Lab  for quite a while now  we've been engaged in a field called active music. What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience  not just listening  but making music  And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers    we call these hyperinstruments    for Yo Yo Ma  Peter Gabriel  Prince  orchestras  rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument  so the instrument knows how it's being played. And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling  I can turn my cello into a voice  or into a whole orchestra  or into something that nobody has ever heard before. When we started making these  I started thinking  why can't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody  people who aren't fantastic Yo Yo Mas or Princes  So  we've made a whole series of instruments. One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera. It's a whole orchestra of about     instruments  all designed for anybody to play using natural skill. So  you can play a video game  drive through a piece of music  use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound  touch a special surface to make melodies  use your voice to make a whole aura. And when we make the Brain Opera  we invite the public to come in  to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the Brain Opera. We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna  where we built a museum around it. And that led to something which you probably do know. Guitar Hero came out of our lab  and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface  people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music  and playing it over and over and over again. So  the model works  but it's only the tip of the iceberg  because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero. And music is very fun  but it's also transformative. It's very  very important. Music can change your life  more than almost anything. It can change the way you communicate with others  it can change your body  it can change your mind. So  we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero. We are very involved in education. We have a long term project called Toy Symphony  where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive  but for little kids  so the kids will fall in love with making music  want to spend their time doing it  and then will demand to know how it works  how to make more  how to create. So  we make squeezy instruments  like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers  Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms    they gather your rhythm  and like hot potato  you send your rhythm to your friends  who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing    and a software package called Hyperscore  which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use  but once you use it  you can go quite deep    music in any style. And then  by pressing a button  it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces. We've had good enough  really  very powerful effects with kids around the world  and now people of all ages  using Hyperscore. So  we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context  for all kinds of people who don't usually have the opportunity to make music. So  one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music  mind and health. A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called  Musicophilia . It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book. If you haven't seen it  it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself  and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations. So we know  for instance  that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to. Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones  you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror  or can't tell anyone in their family  but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities. Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes  movement to people with Parkinson's disease. It's very powerful for depression  schizophrenia  many  many things. So  we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health. And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals. One of them is right near Boston  called Tewksbury Hospital. It's a long term state hospital  where several years ago we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities. This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital  so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities. It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community. I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on. Video  They're manipulating each other's rhythms. It's a real experience  not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms  but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group. To get their hands on music  to shape it themselves  change it  to experiment with it  to make their own music. So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly. Everybody can experience music in a profound way  we just have to make different tools. The third idea I want to share with you is that music  paradoxically  I think even more than words  is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. I love giving talks  although strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music. If I were here playing cello  or playing on a synth  or sharing my music with you  I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words  more personal things  perhaps deeper things. I think that's true for many of us  and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have  from ourselves to the outside world. The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now  called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera  one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now. And it's about a man  rich  successful  powerful  who wants to live forever. So  he figures out a way to download himself into his environment  actually into a series of books. So this guy wants to live forever  he downloads himself into his environment. The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy. And the opera is about what we can share  what we can pass on to others  to the people we love  and what we can't. Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument  like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier  but it's actually a robotic music instrument. So  as you can see in this prototype  gigantic piano strings  each string is controlled with a little robotic element    either little bows that stroke the strings  propellers that tickle the strings  acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage. These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character  Simon Powers  and his family. There are a whole series of them  kind of like a Greek chorus. They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music. They follow the characters. They're smart enough  we hope  not to bump into each other. They go off on their own. And then they can also  when you snap  line up exactly the way you'd like to. Even though they're cubes  they actually have a lot of personality. The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books. Every single book is robotic  so they all move  they all make sound  and when you put them all together  they turn into these walls  which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared  but the whole physical environment becomes this person. This is how he's chosen to represent himself. The books also have high packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display. And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System. This is a sneak preview. This premieres in Monaco    it's in September     . If by any chance you can't make it  another idea with this project    here's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form  through music and through the environment. But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces  as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love. So instead of being grand opera  this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera. And  if you're going to make a personal opera  what about a personal instrument  Everything I've shown you so far    whether it's a hyper cello for Yo Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child    the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person  a virtuoso  a child. But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way I personally behave  to the way my hands work  to what I do very skillfully  perhaps  to what I don't do so skillfully  I think that this is the future of interface  it's the future of music  the future of instruments. And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage  so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like. So  can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger  Ph.D. student from the MIT Media Lab  and Dan Ellsey. Dan  thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet  Dan is here with us today all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital. This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital  I can tell you that  because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music. So  first of all  Dan  do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are  Dan Ellsey  Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am    years old and I have cerebral palsy. I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software. Tod Machover  And we're really excited to have you here  really Dan.  Applause  So we met Dan about three years ago  three and a half years ago  when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic  did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before  and it turned out he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer. He's very shy  too. So  turned out he's a fantastic composer  and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many  many pieces. He makes his own CDs. Actually  he is quite well known in the Boston area    mentors people at the hospital and children  locally  in how to make their own music. And I'll let Adam tell you. So  Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT  an expert in music technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators. What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan be able easily to make his own pieces  but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument. So  you want to say a little bit about how you guys work  Adam Boulanger  Yes. So  Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person  and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face  it's in his breathing  it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music  That's our responsibility  and it doesn't make sense. So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance  with precision  with control  and despite his physical disability  to be able to do that  to be able to perform his piece of music. So  the process and the technology    basically  first we needed an engineering solution. So  you know  we have a FireWire camera  it looked at an infrared pointer. We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller. And this was actually the least interesting part of the work  you know  the design process. We needed an input  we needed continuous tracking  in the software  we look at the types of shapes he's making. But  then was the really interesting aspect of the work  following the engineering part  where  basically  we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out  you know  how does Dan move  What's useful to him as an expressive motion  You know  what's his metaphor for performance  What types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music  So all the parameter fitting  and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan. And  you know  I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies    they provide access  they allow us to create pieces of creative work. But what about expression  What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work  You know  do our technologies allow us to express  Do they provide structure for us to do that  And  you know  that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So  you know  with Dan  we needed a new design process  a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform. And so that's what we'll do today. TM  So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now  DE  This is  My Eagle Song.  TM  So Dan is going to play a piece of his  called  My Eagle Song . In fact  this is the score for Dan's piece  completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore. So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore. He's incredibly fast at it  too  faster than I am  in fact. TM  He's really modest  too. So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms. He can place those exactly where he wants. Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window  draws the lines  places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore  you can see it also  you can see where the sections are  something might continue for a while  change  get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end. So that's the way he made his piece  and as Adam says  we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece. It's going to be looked at by this camera  analyze his movements  it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to. And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen. We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring. But instead of making it very literal  showing you exactly the camera tracing  we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement  and shows the way it's being analyzed. I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing  but I think it will also show you  if you look at that movement  that when Dan makes music  his motions are very purposeful  very precise  very disciplined and they're also very beautiful. So  in hearing this piece  as I mentioned before  the most important thing is the music's great  and it'll show you who Dan is. So  are we ready Adam  AB  Yeah. TM  OK  now Dan will play his piece  My Eagle Song  for you. TM  Bravo.\n",
      "Thank you very much.  Applause  Thank you. It's a distinct privilege to be here. A few weeks ago  I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets. This one entered her left hemisphere  and knocked out her Broca's area  the speech center of her brain. And in this session  Gabby's working with a speech therapist  and she's struggling to produce some of the most basic words  and you can see her growing more and more devastated  until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears  and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist. And after a few moments  her therapist tries a new tack  and they start singing together  and Gabby starts to sing through her tears  and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels  and she sings  in one descending scale  she sings   Let it shine  let it shine  let it shine.  And it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail  in this case literally speak. Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug  one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard  and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy  which has become very popular in music therapy now. Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic  could not form sentences of three  or four word sentences  but they could still sing the lyrics to a song  whether it was  Happy Birthday To You  or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones. And after    hours of intensive singing lessons  he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere's damage. When I was     I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab  and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain    how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non musicians  how music  and listening to music  could just light up the entire brain  from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum  how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism  to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression  how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music  and how late stage Alzheimer's patients  whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family  could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children. But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug  and it was this  that I was at a crossroads in my life  trying to choose between music and medicine. I had just completed my undergraduate  and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe  studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard  and I had fallen in love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon. I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes  these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis  or with children with disfiguring cancers. I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor  that doctor without borders. On the other hand  I had played the violin my entire life. Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession. It was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan  and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv  and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory  but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine. And that afternoon  I had to ask him   How was it for you making that decision   And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to  and that for me  medical school could wait  but that the violin simply would not. And after two more years of studying music  I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta.  Laughter  And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic. It was my first audition  and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week  I was offered the position. And it was a dream. It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra  to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel  but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family  my new musical home. But a year later  I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard  one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician. Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard  but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early   s  was treated with thorazine at Bellevue  and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles    years later. Nathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States  as told through the book and the movie  The Soloist   but I became his friend  and I became his violin teacher  and I told him that wherever he had his violin  and wherever I had mine  I would play a lesson with him. And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row  I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments  from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode. Playing for Nathaniel  the music took on a deeper meaning  because now it was about communication  a communication where words failed  a communication of a message that went deeper than words  that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche  yet came as a true musical offering from me. I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness  yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his  but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets  And at the very core of this crisis of mine  I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me  where somehow  perhaps possibly in a very naive sense  I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill. But in the end  it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change  if I wanted to make a difference  I already had the perfect instrument to do it  that music was the bridge that connected my world and his. There's a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann  who said   To send light into the darkness of men's hearts  such is the duty of the artist.  And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum. And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel  I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony  bringing the light of music into the very darkest places  performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row  performing for combat veterans with post traumatic stress disorder  and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane. After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino  a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face  and she had a palsy  she was shaking  and she had this gorgeous smile  and she said that she had never heard classical music before  she didn't think she was going to like it  she had never heard a violin before  but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine  and that nobody ever came to visit them  and that for the first time in six years  when she heard us play  she stopped shaking without medication. Suddenly  what we're finding with these concerts  away from the stage  away from the footlights  out of the tuxedo tails  the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room  would never have access to the kind of music that we make. Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone  the power and beauty of music transcends the  E  in the middle of our beloved acronym. Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone. The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner  or a symphony by Brahms  or chamber music by Beethoven  compels us to remember our shared  common humanity  the deeply communal connected consciousness  the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard wired into our brain's right hemisphere. And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration  the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them  to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them. And the spark of that beauty  the spark of that humanity transforms into hope  and we know  whether we choose the path of music or of medicine  that's the very first thing we must instill within our communities  within our audiences  if we want to inspire healing from within. I'd like to end with a quote by John Keats  the Romantic English poet  a very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know. Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry  but he died when he was a year older than me. And Keats said   Beauty is truth  and truth beauty. That is all ye know on Earth  and all ye need to know. \n",
      "I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning. But anyway  it's just great to see such a full theater  and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation.  Applause  One of the interesting things  of course  is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology  and of course what he said about listening to our young people. Of course  my job is all about listening  and my aim  really  is to teach the world to listen. That's my only real aim in life. And it sounds quite simple  but actually it's quite a big  big job. Because you know  when you look at a piece of music    for example  if I just open my little motorbike bag    we have here  hopefully  a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page. And  you know  we open it up and I read the music. So technically  I can actually read this. I will follow the instructions  the tempo markings  the dynamics. I will do exactly as I'm told. And so therefore  because time is short  if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so. It's very straightforward. There's nothing too difficult about the piece. But here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick. I'm being told where to play on the drum. I'm being told which part of the stick to use. And I'm being told the dynamic. And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares. Snares on  snares off. So therefore  if I translate this piece of music  we have this idea.  Music  And so on. My career would probably last about five years. However  what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music. Everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher  or to talk about  even  from a teacher. But it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting  and that you want to explore through this tiny  tiny surface of a drum. So there  we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation.  Music   Applause  Now my career may last a little longer  But in a way  you know  it's the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on. I see that you're clutching a teddy bear  etc.  etc. So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about  what you might like  what you might do as a profession  etc.  etc. However  that's just  you know  the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look  and we try to interpret  but actually it's so unbelievably shallow. In the same way  I look at the music  I get a basic idea  I wonder what technically might be hard  or  you know  what I want to do. Just the basic feeling. However  that is simply not enough. And I think what Herbie said    please listen  listen. We have to listen to ourselves  first of all. If I play  for example  holding the stick    where literally I do not let go of the stick    you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm. And you feel really quite    believe it or not    detached from the instrument and from the stick  even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly. By holding it tightly  I feel strangely more detached. If I just simply let go and allow my hand  my arm  to be more of a support system  suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more. And I just feel  at last  one with the stick and one with the drum. And I'm doing far  far less. So in the same way that I need time with this instrument  I need time with people in order to interpret them. Not just translate them  but interpret them. If  for example  I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician    that is  someone who is basically a percussion player ...  Music  And so on. If I think of myself as a musician ...  Music  And so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just     Applause     thinking about. And I remember when I was    years old  and I started playing tympani and percussion  and my teacher said   Well  how are we going to do this  You know  music is about listening.  And I said   Yes  I agree with that. So what's the problem   And he said   Well  how are you going to hear this  How are you going to hear that   And I said   Well  how do you hear it   He said   Well  I think I hear it through here.  And I said   Well  I think I do too    but I also hear it through my hands  through my arms  cheekbones  my scalp  my tummy  my chest  my legs and so on.  And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums    in particular  the kettle drums  or tympani    to such a narrow pitch interval  so something like ... that of a difference. Then gradually ... and gradually ... and it's amazing that when you do open your body up  and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through  that in fact the tiny  tiny difference ... can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger  there. And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room  and together we would  listen  to the sounds of the instruments  and really try to connect with those sounds far  far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. Because of course  the ear is  I mean  subject to all sorts of things. The room we happen to be in  the amplification  the quality of the instrument  the type of sticks ... etc.  etc. They're all different. Same amount of weight  but different sound colors. And that's basically what we are. We're just human beings  but we all have our own little sound colors  as it were  that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things. And as I grew older  I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London  and they said   Well  no  we won't accept you  because we haven't a clue  you know  of the future of a so called 'deaf' musician.  And I just couldn't quite accept that. And so therefore  I said to them   Well  look  if you refuse    if you refuse me through those reasons  as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound    then we have to think very  very hard about the people you do actually accept.  And as a result    once we got over a little hurdle  and having to audition twice    they accepted me. And not only that    what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom. Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms  no legs    they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand. No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry. And every single entry had to be listened to  experienced and then based on the musical ability    then that person could either enter or not. So therefore  this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions. And I have to say  many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world. The interesting thing about this as well  though    is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound    which is basically all of us  and we well know that music really is our daily medicine. I say  music   but actually I mean  sound.  Because you know  some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician  when you may have a    year old lad who has got the most incredible challenges  who may not be able to control his movements  who may be deaf  who may be blind  etc.  etc.    suddenly  if that young lad sits close to this instrument  and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba  and you play something that's so incredibly organ like  almost    I don't really have the right sticks  perhaps    but something like this. Let me change.  Music  Something that's so unbelievably simple    but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be  because I'm on top of the sound. I have the sound coming this way. He would have the sound coming through the resonators. If there were no resonators on here  we would have ...  Music  So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience  those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience either. Every single one of us  depending on where we're sitting  will experience this sound quite  quite differently. And of course  being the participator of the sound  and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce    for example  this sound. Can you hear anything  Exactly. Because I'm not even touching it. But yet  we get the sensation of something happening. In the same way that when I see tree moves  then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound. Do you see what I mean  Whatever the eye sees  then there's always sound happening. So there's always  always that huge    I mean  just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from. So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience  and not by learning a piece of music  putting on someone else's interpretation of it  buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music  and so on and so forth. Because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic  and something that I can fully experience the journey of. So it may be that  in certain halls  this dynamic may well work.  Music  It may be that in other halls  they're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore  my level of soft  gentle playing may have to be ...  Music  Do you see what I mean  So  because of this explosion in access to sound  especially through the deaf community  this has not only affected how music institutions  how schools for the deaf treat sound    and not just as a means of therapy    although of course  being a participator of music  that definitely is the case as well. But it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics  dare I say. But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine. The tiniest  softest  softest sound to something that is so broad  so huge  so incredible  There's always something    it may sound good up there  may not be so good there. May be great there  but terrible up there. Maybe terrible over there  but not too bad there  etc.  etc. So to find an actual hall is incredible    for which you can play exactly what you imagine  without it being cosmetically enhanced. And so therefore  acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired  and who are participators of sound. And this is quite interesting. I cannot  you know  give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls  but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we've been saying   Well  how on Earth can they experience music  You know  they're deaf.  We just    we go like that  and we imagine that that's what deafness is about. Or we go like that  and we imagine that's what blindness is about. If we see someone in a wheelchair  we assume they cannot walk. It may be that they can walk three  four  five steps. That  to them  means they can walk. In a year's time  it could be two extra steps. In another year's time  three extra steps. Those are hugely important aspects to think about. So when we do listen to each other  it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills  to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber  to stop the judgment. For me  as a musician who deals with    percent of new music  it's very easy for me to say   Oh yes  I like that piece. Oh no  I don't like that piece.  And so on. And you know  I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time. It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music  but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music. And you know  it's just one of the great things about being a musician  is that it is so unbelievably fluid. So there are no rules  no right  no wrong  this way  that way. If I asked you to clap    maybe I can do this. If I can just say   Please clap and create the sound of thunder.  I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder. Now  I don't mean just the sound  I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves. And please try to create that through your clapping. Try. Just    please try. Very good  Snow. Snow. Have you ever heard snow  Audience  No. Evelyn Glennie  Well then  stop clapping.  Laughter  Try again. Try again. Snow. See  you're awake. Rain. Not bad. Not bad. You know  the interesting thing here  though  is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question. Now    great imagination  thank you very much. However  not one of you got out of your seats to think   Right  How can I clap  OK  maybe ...  Claps  Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds. Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds.  Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands. In the same way that when we listen to music  we assume that it's all being fed through here. This is how we experience music. Of course it's not. We experience thunder    thunder  thunder. Think  think  think. Listen  listen  listen. Now    what can we do with thunder  I remember my teacher. When I first started  my very first lesson  I was all prepared with sticks  ready to go. And instead of him saying   OK  Evelyn  please  feet slightly apart  arms at a more or less    degree angle  sticks in a more or less V shape  keep this amount of space here  etc. Please keep your back straight  etc.  etc.  etc.     where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid  frozen  and I would not be able to strike the drum  because I was thinking of so many other things    he said   Evelyn  take this drum away for seven days  and I'll see you next week.  So  heavens  What was I to do  I no longer required the sticks  I wasn't allowed to have these sticks. I had to basically look at this particular drum  see how it was made  what these little lugs did  what the snares did. Turned it upside down  experimented with the shell  experimented with the head. Experimented with my body  experimented with jewelry  experimented with all sorts of things. And of course  I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that    but nevertheless  it was such an unbelievable experience  because then  where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music  Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book  So we never  ever dealt with actual study books. So for example  one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player  as opposed to a musician  is basically straightforward single stroke rolls. Like that. And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster. And so on and so forth. What does this piece require  Single stroke rolls. So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music  And that's exactly what he did. And interestingly  the older I became  and when I became a full time student at a so called  music institution   all of that went out of the window. We had to study from study books. And constantly  the question   Well  why  Why  What is this relating to  I need to play a piece of music.   Oh  well  this will help your control    Well  how  Why do I need to learn that  I need to relate it to a piece of music. You know. I need to say something.  Why am I practicing paradiddles  Is it just literally for control  for hand stick control  Why am I doing that  I need to have the reason  and the reason has to be by saying something through the music.  And by saying something through music  which basically is sound  we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people. But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage. That's up to you  when you walk through a hall. Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things. I may feel sorrowful  or happy  or exhilarated  or angry when I play certain pieces of music  but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing. So please  the next time you go to a concert  just allow your body to open up  allow your body to be this resonating chamber. Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is. The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound  because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum  or the mallet on the bit of wood  or the bow on the string  etc.  or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass. They're experiencing that rawness there. But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure  which is before the sound is actually happening. Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike  or breath  is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference  rather than just arriving last night. But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses. But thank you very much for having me \n",

      "sex males female male insects females sexual sperm love arab\n",
      "Anyone in the room thought about sex today  Yeah  you did. Thank you for putting your hand up over there. Well  I'm here to provide you with some biological validation for your sordid daydreams. I'm here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex. Now  when humans think about sex  male and female forms are generally what come to mind  but for many millions of years  such specific categories didn't even exist. Sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of DNA shared between two or more beings. It wasn't until about     million years ago that we start to see structures akin to a penis or a thing that gives DNA out  and a vagina  something that receives it. Now invariably  you're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species  these very familiar structures  but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind blowing. Penile diversity is especially profuse. So this is a paper nautilus. It's a close relative of squid and octopus  and males have a hectocotylus. Just what is a hectocotylus  A detachable  swimming penis. It leaves the  body of the male   finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water  attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm. For many decades  biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether. Now  the tapir is a mammal from South America. And the tapir has a prehensile penis. It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands. And it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus  not to mention it's a pretty good size. The biggest penis in the animal kingdom  however  is not that of the tapir. The biggest penis to body size ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle  and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that of a barnacle. Mm hm.  Laughter  So with all of this diversity in structure  one might think  then  that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction. Simply insert part A into slot B  and we should all be good to go. But of course  that doesn't exactly happen  and that's because we can't just take form into account. We have to think about function as well  and when it comes to sex  function relates to the contributions made by the gametes  or the sperm and the eggs. And these contributions are far from equal. Eggs are very expensive to make  so it makes sense for females to be very choosy about who she shares them with. Sperm  on the other hand  is abundant and cheap  so it makes more sense for males to have a more sex is better strategy when it comes to siring members of future generations. So how do animals cope with these very incongruent needs between the sexes  I mean  if a female doesn't choose a particular male  or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough  then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things  avoiding predators  taking care of offspring  gathering and ingesting food. This is  of course  bad news for any male who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank  and this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies for successful fertilization. This is bedbug sex  and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination. Males have a spiked  barbed penis that they literally stab into the female  and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina. They stab it anywhere in her body  and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries. If a female gets too many stab wounds  or if a stab wound happens to become infected  she can actually die from it. Now if you've ever been out for a nice  peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex  you've undoubtedly been alarmed  because it looks like gang rape. And quite frankly  that's exactly what it is. A group of males will grab a female  hold her down  and ballistically ejaculate their spiral shaped penis into her corkscrew shaped vagina over and over and over again. From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second. Now the female actually gets the last laugh  though  because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries. Now  I like to share stories like this with my audiences because  yeah  we humans  we tend to think sex  sex is fun  sex is good  there's romance  and there's orgasm. But orgasm didn't actually evolve until about    million years ago with the advent of mammals. But some animals had it going on quite a bit before that. There are some more primitive ways of pleasing one's partner. Earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones. It's a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different. Those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all. So going back to our biological minds  then  we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages  because she can use her time for other things  avoiding predators  taking care of young  finding and ingesting food. But biologists have repeatedly observed that females choose to have sex with the males that have the long appendages. Why do they do this  Well  according to the biological literature   During copulation  the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract.  Mm hm. These are Mexican guppies  and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments  and these filaments basically form a fish mustache  if you will. Now males have been observed to prod the female's genital opening prior to copulating with her  and in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum  P.I. hypothesis  females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches. A little guppy porn for you right there. So we've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner. We've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex. We've also seen a titillation strategy where males are actually pleasing their female partners into choosing them as a sex partner. Now unfortunately  in the animal kingdom  it's the coercion strategy that we see time and time again. It's very common in many phyla  from invertebrates to avian species  mammals  and  of course  even in primates. Now interestingly  there  are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place. Female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris  or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally  much like a penis  and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology. So before a male can insert his penis into a female's vagina  she has to take this penile clitoris and basically inside out it in her own body. I mean  imagine putting a penis into another penis. It's simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action. Now  even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal  they're run by females  groups of females  sisters  aunts and offspring  and when young males attain sexual maturity  they're turfed out of the group. In hyena societies  adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale. They can take part in a kill only after everybody else  including the offspring. So it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male  you take away all the social power he has. So what are my take home messages from my talk today  Well  sex is just so much more than insert part A into slot B and hope that the offspring run around everywhere. The sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically dictate how males and females will react to each other  which then dictates how populations and societies form and evolve. So it may not be surprising to any of you that animals  including ourselves  spend a good amount of time thinking about sex  but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it. So thank you  and happy daydreaming.\n",
      "So  people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying. At least  according to a       Book of Lists  survey which preceded all those online best  worst  funniest lists that you see today. Only heights and public speaking exceeded the six legged as sources of fear. And I suspect if you had put spiders in there  the combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart. Now  I am not one of those people. I really love insects. I think they're interesting and beautiful  and sometimes even cute. And I'm not alone. For centuries  some of the greatest minds in science  from Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson  have drawn inspiration from studying some of the smallest minds on Earth. Well  why is that  What is that keeps us coming back to insects  Some of it  of course  is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them. They're more numerous than any other kind of animal. We don't even know how many species of insects there are  because new ones are being discovered all the time. There are at least a million  maybe as many as    million. This means that you could have an insect of the month calendar and not have to reuse a species for over        years. Take that  pandas and kittens  More seriously  insects are essential. We need them. It's been estimated that   out of every   bites of food is made possible by a pollinator. Scientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries about everything from the structure of our nervous systems to how our genes and DNA work. But what I love most about insects is what they can tell us about our own behavior. Insects seem like they do everything that people do. They meet  they mate  they fight  they break up. And they do so with what looks like love or animosity. But what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own  and that difference can be really illuminating. There's nowhere where that's more true than when it comes to one of our most consuming interests    sex. Now  I will maintain. and I think I can defend  what may seem like a surprising statement. I think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people. And the wild variety that we see makes us challenge some of our own assumptions about what it means to be male and female. Of course  to start with  a lot of insects don't need to have sex at all to reproduce. Female aphids can make little  tiny clones of themselves without ever mating. Virgin birth  right there. On your rose bushes. When they do have sex  even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm. There are some kinds of fruit flies whose sperm is longer than the male's own body. And that's important because the males use their sperm to compete. Now  male insects do compete with weapons  like the horns on these beetles. But they also compete after mating with their sperm. Dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives with all of the attachments pulled out. They use these formidable devices like scoops  to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with. So  what can we learn from this  All right  it is not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them or of them setting an example for us to follow. Which  given this  is probably just as well. And also  did I mention sexual cannibalism is rampant among insects  So  no  that's not the point. But what I think insects do  is break a lot of the rules that we humans have about the sex roles. So  people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a     s sitcom version of what males and females are like. So that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive  and females are passive and coy. But that's just not the case. So for example  take katydids  which are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers. The males are very picky about who they mate with  because they not only transfer sperm during mating  they also give the female something called a nuptial gift. You can see two katydids mating in these photos. In both panels  the male's the one on the right  and that sword like appendage is the female's egg laying organ. The white blob is the sperm  the green blob is the nuptial gift  and the male manufactures this from his own body and it's extremely costly to produce. It can weigh up to a third of his body mass. I will now pause for a moment and let you think about what it would be like if human men  every time they had sex  had to produce something that weighed            pounds. Okay  they would not be able to do that very often. And indeed  neither can the katydids. And so what that means is the katydid males are very choosy about who they offer these nuptial gifts to. Now  the gift is very nutritious  and the female eats it during and after mating. So  the bigger it is  the better off the male is  because that means more time for his sperm to drain into her body and fertilize her eggs. But it also means that the males are very passive about mating  whereas the females are extremely aggressive and competitive  in an attempt to get as many of these nutritious nuptial gifts as they can. So  it's not exactly a stereotypical set of rules. Even more generally though  males are actually not all that important in the lives of a lot of insects. In the social insects    the bees and wasps and ants    the individuals that you see every day    the ants going back and forth to your sugar bowl  the honey bees that are flitting from flower to flower    all of those are always female. People have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia. The ancient Greeks knew that there was a class of bees  the drones  that are larger than the workers  although they disapproved of the drones' laziness because they could see that the drones just hang around the hive until the mating flight    they're the males. They hang around until the mating flight  but they don't participate in gathering nectar or pollen. The Greeks couldn't figure out the drones' sex  and part of the confusion was that they were aware of the stinging ability of bees but they found it difficult to believe that any animals that bore such a weapon could possibly be a female. Aristotle tried to get involved as well. He suggested   OK  if the stinging individuals are going to be the males ...  Then he got confused  because that would have meant the males were also taking care of the young in a colony  and he seemed to think that would be completely impossible. He then concluded that maybe bees had the organs of both sexes in the same individual  which is not that far fetched  some animals do that  but he never really did get it figured out. And you know  even today  my students  for instance  call every animal they see  including insects  a male. And when I tell them that the ferocious army ant soldiers with their giant jaws  used to defend the colony  are all always female  they seem to not quite believe me. And certainly all of the movies    Antz  Bee Movie    portray the main character in the social insects as being male. Well  what difference does this make  These are movies. They're fiction. They have talking animals in them. What difference does it make if they talk like Jerry Seinfeld  I think it does matter  and it's a problem that actually is part of a much deeper one that has implications for medicine and health and a lot of other aspects of our lives. You all know that scientists use what we call model systems  which are creatures    white rats or fruit flies    that are kind of stand ins for all other animals  including people. And the idea is that what's true for a person will also be true for the white rat. And by and large  that turns out to be the case. But you can take the idea of a model system too far. And what I think we've done  is use males  in any species  as though they are the model system. The norm. The way things are supposed to be. And females as a kind of variant    something special that you only study after you get the basics down. And so  back to the insects. I think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them. Because they assumed that the world's stage was largely occupied by male players and females would only have minor  walk on roles. But when we do that  we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like. And we can also miss out on the way natural  living things  including people  can vary. And I think that's why we've used males as models in a lot of medical research  something that we know now to be a problem if we want the results to apply to both men and women. Well  the last thing I really love about insects is something that a lot of people find unnerving about them. They have little  tiny brains with very little cognitive ability  the way we normally think of it. They have complicated behavior  but they lack complicated brains. And so  we can't just think of them as though they're little people because they don't do things the way that we do. I really love that it's difficult to anthropomorphize insects  to look at them and just think of them like they're little people in exoskeletons  with six legs. Instead  you really have to accept them on their own terms  because insects make us question what's normal and what's natural. Now  you know  people write fiction and talk about parallel universes. They speculate about the supernatural  maybe the spirits of the departed walking among us. The allure of another world is something that people say is part of why they want to dabble in the paranormal. But as far as I'm concerned  who needs to be able to see dead people  when you can see live insects  Thank you.\n",
      "As a scientist  and also as a human being  I've been trying to make myself susceptible to wonder. I think Jason Webley last night called it  conspiring to be part of the magic.  So it's fortunate that my career as a biologist lets me dive deeply into the lives of some truly wondrous creatures that share our planet  fireflies. Now  for many of you  I know that fireflies might conjure up some really great memories  childhood  summertime  even other TED Talks. Maybe something like this. My seduction into the world of fireflies began when I was back in graduate school. One evening  I was sitting out in my backyard in North Carolina  and suddenly  these silent sparks rose up all around me  and I began to wonder  How do these creatures make light  and what's with all this flashing  Are they talking to one another  And what happens after the lights go out  I've been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as I've explored this nocturnal world. Now if you've ever seen or even heard about fireflies  then you'll know how magically they can transform our everyday landscape into something ethereal and otherworldly  and this happens around the globe  like this hillside in the Smoky Mountains that I saw transformed into a living cascade of light by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies  or a roadside river that I visited in Japan as it was giving birth to the slow  floating flashes of these Genji fireflies  or in Malaysia  the mangrove trees that I watched blossom nightly not with flowers but with the lights of a thousand     Bleep  Bleep     fireflies  all blinking together in stunning synchrony. These luminous landscapes still fill me with wonder  and they keep me connected to the magic of the natural world. And I find it amazing that they're created by these tiny insects. In person  fireflies are charming. They're charismatic. They've been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries. As I've traveled around the world  I've met many thoughtful people who have told me that God put fireflies on Earth for humans to enjoy. Other creatures can enjoy them too. I think these graceful insects are truly miraculous because they so beautifully illuminate the creative improvisation of evolution. They've been shaped by two powerful evolutionary forces  natural selection  the struggle for survival  and sexual selection  the struggle for reproductive opportunity. As a firefly junkie  the past    years have been quite an exciting ride. Together with my students at Tufts University and other colleagues  we've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies  their courtship and sex lives  their treachery and murder. So today I'd like to share with you just a couple of tales that we've brought back from our collective adventures into this hidden world. Fireflies belong to a very beautiful and diverse group of insects  the beetles. Worldwide  there are more than       firefly species  and these have evolved remarkably diverse courtship signals  that is  different ways to find and attract mates. Around     million years ago  the very first fireflies probably looked like this. They flew during the daytime and they didn't light up. Instead  males used their fantastic antennae to sniff out perfumes given off by their females. In other fireflies  it's only the females who light up. They are attractively plump and wingless  so every night  they climb up onto perches and they glow brightly for hours to attract their flying but unlit males. In still other fireflies  both sexes use quick  bright flashes to find their mates. Here in North America  we have more than     different kinds of firefly that have the remarkable ability to shine energy out from their bodies in the form of light. How do they do that  It seems totally magical  but these bioluminescent signals arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions that happen inside the firefly lantern. The main star is an enzyme called luciferase  which in the course of evolution has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms around an even smaller molecule called luciferin  in the process getting it so excited that it actually gives off light. Incredible. But how could these bright lights have benefited some proto firefly  To answer this question  we need to flip back in the family album to some baby pictures. Fireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow. They spend the vast majority of their lifetime  up to two years  in this larval form. Their main goal here  like my teenagers  is to eat and grow. And firefly light first originated in these juveniles. Every single firefly larva can light up  even when their adults can't. But what's the point to being so conspicuous  Well  we know that these juveniles make nasty tasting chemicals that help them survive their extended childhood  so we think these lights first evolved as a warning  a neon sign that says   Toxic  Stay away   to any would be predators. It took many millions of years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential predators but to bring in potential mates. Driven now by sexual selection  some adult fireflies like this proud male evolved a shiny new glow in the dark lantern that would let them take courtship to a whole new level. These adults only live a few weeks  and now they're single mindedly focused on sex  that is  on propelling their genes into the next firefly generation. So we can follow this male out into the field as he joins hundreds of other males who are all showing off their new courtship signals. It's amazing to think that the luminous displays we admire here and in fact everywhere around the world are actually the silent love songs of male fireflies. They're flying and flashing their hearts out. I still find it very romantic. But meanwhile  where are all the females  Well  they're lounging down below surveying their options. They have plenty of males to choose from  and these females turn out to be very picky. When a female sees a flash from an especially attractive male  she'll aim her lantern in his direction  and give him a flash back. It's her  come hither  sign. So he flies closer and he flashes again. If she still likes him  they'll strike up a conversation. These creatures speak their love in the language of light. So what exactly do these females consider sexy  We decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls to find out. When we tested females using blinking LED lights  we discovered they prefer males who give longer lasting flashes. I know you're wondering  what gives these males their sex appeal  Now we get to see what happens when the lights go out. The first thing we discovered is that once a male and female hook up like this  they stay together all night long  and when we looked inside to see what might be happening  we discovered a surprising new twist to firefly sex. While they're mating  the male is busy giving the female not just his sperm but also a nutrient filled package called a nuptial gift. We can zoom in to look more closely inside this mating pair. We can actually see the gift   it's shown here in red   as it's being passed from the male to the female. What makes this gift so valuable is that it's packed with protein that the female will use to provision her eggs. So females are keeping their eyes on this prize as they size up potential mates. We discovered that females use male flash signals to try to predict which males have the biggest gifts to offer  because this bling helps the female lay more eggs and ultimately launch more of her own offspring into the next generation. So it's not all sweetness and light. Firefly romance is risky. For the most part  these adult fireflies don't get eaten because like their juveniles they can manufacture toxins that are repellent to birds and other insectivores  but somewhere along the line  one particular group of fireflies somehow lost the metabolic machinery needed to make their own protective toxins. This evolutionary flaw  which was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner  has driven these fireflies to take their bright lights out into the night with treacherous intent. Dubbed  femme fatales  by Jim Lloyd  another colleague  these females have figured out how to target the males of other firefly species. So the hunt begins with the predator   she's shown here in the lower left   where she's sitting quietly and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation of her intended prey  and here's how it might go. First the prey male flashes   Do you love me   His own female responds   Maybe.  So then he flashes again. But this time  the predator sneaks in a reply that cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said. She's not looking for love  she's looking for toxins. If she's good  she can lure this male close enough to reach out and grab him  and he's not just a light snack. Over the next hour  she slowly exsanguinates this male leaving behind just some gory remains. Unable to make their own toxins  these females resort to drinking the blood of other fireflies to get these protective chemicals. So a firefly vampire  brought to you by natural selection. We still have a lot to learn about fireflies  but it looks like many stories will remain untold  because around the world  firefly populations are blinking out. The main culprit  habitat loss. Pretty much everywhere  the fields and forests  the mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive  are giving way to development and to sprawl. Here's another problem  we've conquered darkness  but in the process  we spill so much extra light out into the night that it disrupts the lives of other creatures  and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution because it obscures the signals that they use to find their mates. Do we really need fireflies  After all  they're just one tiny bit of Earth's biodiversity. Yet every time a species is lost  it's like extinguishing a room full of candles one by one. You might not notice when the first few flames flicker out  but in the end  you're left sitting in darkness. As we work together to craft a planetary future  I hope we can find a way to keep these bright lights shining. Thank you.\n",
      "So when I was in Morocco  in Casablanca  not so long ago  I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza. Faiza showed me photos of her infant son and she told me the story of his conception  pregnancy  and delivery. It was a remarkable tale  but Faiza saved the best for last.  You know  I am a virgin   she told me.  I have two medical certificates to prove it.  This is the modern Middle East  where two millennia after the coming of Christ  virgin births are still a fact of life. Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard  over the years  traveling across the Arab region talking to people about sex. Now  I know this might sound like a dream job  or possibly a highly dubious occupation  but for me  it's something else altogether. I'm half Egyptian  and I'm Muslim. But I grew up in Canada  far from my Arab roots. Like so many who straddle East and West  I've been drawn  over the years  to try to better understand my origins. That I chose to look at sex comes from  my background in HIV AIDS  as a writer and a researcher and an activist. Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the Middle East and North Africa  which is one of only two regions in the world where HIV AIDS is still on the rise. Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society  because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage  in politics and economics  in religion and tradition   in gender and generations. As I found  if you really want to know a people  you start by looking inside their bedrooms. Now to be sure  the Arab world is vast and varied. But running across it are three red lines    these are topics you are not supposed  to challenge in word or deed. The first of these is politics. But the Arab Spring has changed all that  in uprisings which have blossomed  across the region since     . Now while those in power  old and new  continue to cling to business as usual  millions are still pushing back  and pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life. That second red line is religion. But now religion and politics are connected  with the rise of such groups as the  Muslim Brotherhood. And some people  at least  are starting  to ask questions about the role of Islam in public and private life. You know  as for that third red line   that off limits subject  what do you think it might be  Audience  Sex. Shereen El Feki  Louder  I can't hear you. Audience  Sex. SEF  Again  please don't be shy. Audience  Sex. SEF  Absolutely  that's right  it's sex.  Laughter  Across the Arab region  the only accepted context for sex is marriage    approved by your parents  sanctioned by religion and registered by the state. Marriage is your ticket to adulthood. If you don't tie the knot  you can't  move out of your parents' place  and you're not supposed to be having sex  and you're definitely not supposed  to be having children. It's a social citadel  it's an impregnable fortress which resists any assault  any alternative. And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex  against condoms  against abortion  against homosexuality  you name it. Faiza was living proof of this. Her virginity statement was  not a piece of wishful thinking. Although the major religions of the region extoll premarital chastity  in a patriarchy  boys will be boys. Men have sex before marriage  and people more or less turn a blind eye. Not so for women  who are expected to be virgins  on their wedding night    that is  to turn up with your hymen intact. This is not a question of individual concern  this is a matter of family honor   and in particular  men's honor. And so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve  this tiny piece of anatomy    from female genital mutilation  to virginity testing  to hymen repair surgery. Faiza chose a different route  non vaginal sex. Only she became pregnant all the same. But Faiza didn't actually realize this  because there's so little  sexuality education in schools  and so little communication in the family. When her condition became hard to hide  Faiza's mother helped her flee  her father and brothers. This is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the Arab region. And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at  a hospital in Casablanca  the man who offered to help her  instead tried to rape her. Sadly  Faiza is not alone. In Egypt  where my research is focused  I have seen plenty of trouble  in and out of the citadel. There are legions of young men who can't afford to get married  because marriage has become  a very expensive proposition. They are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life  but they can't find jobs. This is one of the major drivers  of the recent uprisings  and it is one of the reasons for the  rising age of marriage in much of the Arab region. There are career women who want to get married  but can't find a husband  because they defy gender expectations  or as one young female doctor  in Tunisia put it to me   The women  they are becoming more and more open. But the man  he is still at the prehistoric stage.  And then there are men and women who  cross the heterosexual line  who have sex with their own sex  or who have a different gender identity. They are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities  even their appearance. And they face a daily struggle with social stigma  with family despair  and with religious fire and brimstone. Now  it's not as if it's all rosy  in the marital bed either. Couples who are looking for greater happiness  greater sexual happiness in their married lives  but are at a loss of how to achieve it  especially wives  who are afraid  of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom. And then there are those whose marriages are actually a veil for prostitution. They have been sold by their families  often to wealthy Arab tourists. This is just one face of a booming  sex trade across the Arab region. Now raise your hand if any of  this is sounding familiar to you  from your part of the world. Yeah. It's not as if the Arab world has a monopoly on sexual hangups. And although we don't yet have an Arab Kinsey Report to tell us exactly what's happening  inside bedrooms across the Arab region  It's pretty clear that  something is not right. Double standards for men and women  sex as a source of shame  family control limiting individual choices  and a vast gulf between appearance and reality  what people are doing and what they're willing to admit to  and a general reluctance to move  beyond private whispers to a serious and sustained public discussion. As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me   Here  sex is the opposite of sport. Football  everybody talks about it  but hardly anyone plays. But sex  everybody is doing it  but nobody wants to talk about it.   Laughter  SEF  I want to give you a piece of advice  which if you follow it  will make you happy in life. When your husband reaches out to you  when he seizes a part of your body  sigh deeply and look at him lustily. When he penetrates you with his penis  try to talk flirtatiously and  move yourself in harmony with him. Hot stuff  And it might sound that these handy hints come from  The Joy of Sex  or YouPorn. But in fact  they come from a   th century Arabic book called  The Encyclopedia of Pleasure   which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia  and everything in between. The Encyclopedia is just one  in a long line of Arabic erotica  much of it written by religious scholars. Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad  there is a rich tradition in Islam of talking frankly about sex  not just its problems  but also its pleasures  and not just for men  but also for women. A thousand years ago  we used to have  whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic. Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature  position and preference  a body of language that was rich enough to make up the body  of the woman you see on this page. Today  this history is largely unknown  in the Arab region. Even by educated people  who often feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do in their own tongue. Today's sexual landscape looks a lot like Europe and America on the brink of the sexual revolution. But while the West has opened on sex  what we found is that Arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction. In Egypt and many of its neighbors  this closing down is part of a wider closing in political  social and cultural thought. And it is the product of a complex historical process  one which has gained ground with the rise  of Islamic conservatism since the late     s.  Just say no  is what conservatives  around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo. In the Arab region  they brand these attempts as a Western conspiracy to undermine traditional Arab and Islamic values. But what's really at stake here is one of their most powerful tools of control  sex wrapped up in religion. But history shows us that  even as recently as our fathers' and grandfathers' day  there have been times of greater pragmatism  and tolerance  and a willingness to consider other interpretations  be it abortion  or masturbation  or even  the incendiary topic of homosexuality. It is not black and white  as conservatives would have us believe. In these  as in so many other matters  Islam offers us at least    shades of gray. Over my travels  I've met men and women  across the Arab region who've been exploring that spectrum    sexologists who are trying to help couples find greater happiness in their marriages  innovators who are managing to get  sexuality education into schools  small groups of men and women  lesbian  gay  transgendered  transsexual  who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real world support. Women  and increasingly men  who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home. Groups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against HIV and other occupational hazards  and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza find a place in society  and critically  stay with their kids. Now these efforts are small   they're often underfunded  and they face formidable opposition. But I am optimistic that  in the long run  times are changing  and they and their ideas will gain ground. Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region through dramatic confrontation  beating or indeed baring of breasts  but rather through negotiation. What we're talking here is not about a  sexual revolution  but a sexual evolution   learning from other parts of the world  adapting to local conditions  forging our own path  not following one blazed by another. That path  I hope  will one day lead us  to the right to control our own bodies  and to access the information  and services we need to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives. The right to express our ideas freely  to marry whom we choose   to choose our own partners  to be sexually active or not  to decide whether to have children and when  all this without violence or force or discrimination. Now we are very far from this  across the Arab region  and so much needs to change  law  education  media  the economy  the list goes on and on  and it is the work of a generation  at least. But it begins with a journey that I myself have made  asking hard questions of received wisdoms in sexual life. And it is a journey which has only served to strengthen my faith  and my appreciation of local histories and cultures by showing me possibilities  where I once only saw absolutes. Now given the turmoil in many countries in the Arab region  talking about sex   challenging the taboos  seeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury. But at this critical moment in history  if we do not anchor freedom and justice  dignity and equality  privacy and autonomy in our personal lives  in our sexual lives  we will find it very hard to achieve in public life. The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows  and that is true for us all. no matter where we live and love. Thank you.\n",
      "I'm going to go off script and make Chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation. All right. Are you with me  Yeah. Yeah. All right. So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand if you've ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex. Could be the neighbors  hotel room  your parents. Sorry. Okay. Pretty much everybody. Now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman. I see one guy there. It doesn't count if it was you  sir. So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay. Sitting next to a loud guy. Now what does this tell us  It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex  and it's generally the woman who makes more noise. This is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd. I wasn't even going to mention this  but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here  and she is the world's most famous female copulatory vocalizer. So I thought  got to talk about that. We'll get back to that a little bit later. Let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes  despite what you may have heard. We are apes. We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant  as Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books. We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate    gorillas  orangutans  what have you. So we're extremely closely related to them  and as you'll see in terms of our behavior  we've got some relationship as well. So what I'm asking today  the question I want to explore with you today is  what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality  Now  since Darwin's day there's been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution  and you're all familiar with it  even if you haven't read this stuff. The idea is that  as part of human nature  from the beginning of our species' time  men have sort of leased women's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services. Generally we're talking about meat  shelter  status  protection  things like that. And in exchange  women have offered fidelity  or at least a promise of fidelity. Now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship. The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA  according to this vision. Right  What Cacilda and I have argued is that no  this economic relationship  this oppositional relationship  is actually an artifact of agriculture  which only arose about        years ago at the earliest. Anatomically modern human beings have been around for about         years  so we're talking about five percent  at most  of our time as a modern  distinct species. So before agriculture  before the agricultural revolution  it's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they're found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism. They not only share things  they demand that things be shared  meat  shelter  protection  all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity  it turns out  are shared widely among these societies. Now I'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages  and I'm not saying modern day hunter gatherers are noble savages either. What I'm saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context. And there's really no argument about this among anthropologists. All Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality. So we've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved  until agriculture  as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex  flexible social systems  networks  that our ancestors were very good at  and that's why our species has survived so well. Now  this makes some people uncomfortable  and so I always need to take  a moment in these talks to say  listen  I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous  but I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. There were no strangers. Right  In a hunter gatherer band  there are no strangers. You've known these people your entire life. So I'm saying  yes  there were overlapping sexual relationships  that our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives. But I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. I'm not saying that they didn't love the people they were having sex with. And I'm not saying there was no pair bonding going on. I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive. And those of us who have chosen to be monogamous    my parents  for example  have been married for    years monogamously  and if it wasn't monogamously  Mom and Dad  I don't want to hear about it  I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this. What I'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism. You can choose to be a vegetarian  but don't think that just because you've made that decision  bacon suddenly stops smelling good. Okay  So this is my point. That one took a minute to sink in  huh  Now  in addition to being a great genius  a wonderful man  a wonderful husband  a wonderful father  Charles Darwin was also a world class Victorian prude. All right  He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates  including chimps and bonobos  because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females. So he couldn't understand why on Earth would the female have developed this thing if all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond  right  Chimps and bonobos  Darwin didn't really know this  but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings. Interestingly  chimps have sexual swellings through    percent  roughly  of their menstrual cycle  bonobos    percent  and humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle  whether she's menstruating  whether she's post menopausal  whether she's already pregnant. This is vanishingly rare among mammals. So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality. Now  Darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day  as scientists tend to do sometimes. So what we're talking about is sperm competition. Now the average human ejaculate has about     million sperm cells  so it's already a competitive environment. The question is whether these sperm are  competing against other men's sperm or just their own. There's a lot to talk about in this chart. The one thing I'll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human. That indicates female copulatory vocalization. Just look at the numbers. The average human has sex about       times per birth. If that number seems high for some of you  I assure you it seems low for others in the room. We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos. We don't share it with the other three apes  the gorilla  the orangutan and the gibbon  who are more typical of mammals  having sex only about a dozen times per birth. Humans and bonobos are the only  animals that have sex face to face when both of them are alive. And you'll see that the human  chimp and bonobo all have external testicles  which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer. If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage  you expect a party to happen at any moment  and you need to be ready. That's what the external testicles are. They keep the sperm cells cool so you can have frequent ejaculations. I'm sorry. It's true. The human  some of you will be happy to hear  has the largest  thickest penis of any primate. Now  this evidence goes way beyond anatomy. It goes into anthropology as well. Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution. These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China. In their society  everyone  men and women  are completely sexually autonomous. There's no shame associated with sexual behavior. Women have hundreds of partners. It doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nobody gossips. It's not an issue. When the woman becomes pregnant  the child is cared for by her   her sisters  and her brothers. The biological father is a nonissue. On the other side of the planet  in the Amazon  we've got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity. These people actually believe    and they have no contact among them  no common language or anything  so it's not an idea that spread  it's an idea that's arisen around the world    they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen. So a woman who wants to have a child who's smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy  the funny guy and the strong guy  to get the essence of each of these men into the baby  and then when the child is born  these different men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child. So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor in this society. So there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book. Now  why does this matter  Edward Wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation. I think that's true. This matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world. The contradictions between what we're told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering. My hope is that a more accurate  updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves  for each other  greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations like same sex marriage or polyamorous unions  and that we'll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate  instinctive right to monitor and control women's sexual behavior. Thank you. And we'll see that it's not only gay people that have to come out of the closet. We all have closets we have to come out of. Right  And when we do come out of those closets  we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other  our fight is with an outdated   Victorian sense of human sexuality that conflates desire with property rights  generates shame and confusion in place of understanding and empathy. It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus  because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Christopher Ryan  Thank you. CA  So a question. It's so perplexing  trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today. Someone could give a talk and say  look at us  we've got these really sharp teeth and muscles and a brain that's really good at throwing weapons  and if you look at lots of societies around the world  you'll see very high rates of violence. Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism  but it's not who you are. How is that different from the talk you gave  CR  Well first of all  the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable. But that's just an example. Certainly  you know  lots of people say to me  just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn't mean we should live that  way now  and I agree with that. Everyone has to respond to the modern world. But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories. And so you could live on McDonald's and milkshakes  but your body will rebel against  that. We have appetites. I think it was Schopenhauer who said  a person can do what they want but not want what they want. And so what I'm arguing against is the shame that's associated with desires. It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people  there's something wrong with you  there's something wrong with your marriage  something wrong with your partner. I think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality. That's what I'm trying to get at. CA  Thank you. Communicated powerfully. Thanks a lot. CR  Thank you  Chris.  Applause \n",

      "sound voice listening noise sounds hear ears listen hearing voices\n",
      "Over the next five minutes  my intention is to transform your relationship with sound. Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental  and much of it is unpleasant.  Traffic noise  We stand on street corners  shouting over noise like this  and pretending that it doesn't exist. Well  this habit of suppressing sound has meant that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious. There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time  and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today. First is physiological.  Loud alarm clocks  Sorry about that. I've just given you a shot of cortisol  your fight flight hormone. Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time  but also your breathing  your heart rate    which I just also did    and your brainwaves. It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it. This is surf.  Ocean waves  It has the frequency of roughly    cycles per minute. Most people find that very soothing  and  interestingly     cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human. There is a deep resonance with being at rest. We also associate it with being stress free and on holiday. The second way in which sound affects you is psychological. Music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state.  Albinoni's Adagio  This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on. Music is not the only kind of sound  however  which affects your emotions. Natural sound can do that too. Birdsong  for example  is a sound which most people find reassuring.  Birds chirping  There is a reason for that. Over hundreds of thousands of years we've learned that when the birds are singing  things are safe. It's when they stop you need to be worried. The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively. You can't understand two people talking at once   If you're listening to this version of   Try and listen to the other one.   You have to choose which me you're going to listen to.   We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input  which is why noise like this     Office noise     is extremely damaging for productivity. If you have to work in an open plan office like this  your productivity is greatly reduced. And whatever number you're thinking of  it probably isn't as bad as this. You are one third as productive in open plan offices as in quiet rooms. And I have a tip for you. If you have to work in spaces like that  carry headphones with you  with a soothing sound like birdsong. Put them on and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be. The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally. With all that other stuff going on  it would be amazing if our behavior didn't change. at a steady    miles per hour  I don't think so. At the simplest  you move away from unpleasant sound and towards pleasant sounds. So if I were to play this     Jackhammer     for more than a few seconds  you'd feel uncomfortable  for more than a few minutes  you'd be leaving the room in droves. For people who can't get away from noise like that  it's extremely damaging for their health. And that's not the only thing that bad sound damages. Most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental  and even hostile  and it has a dramatic effect on sales. For those of you who are retailers  you may want to look away before I show this slide. They are losing up to    percent of their business with people leaving shops faster  or just turning around on the door. We all have done it  leaving the area because the sound in there is so dreadful. I want to spend just a moment talking about the model that we've developed  which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound  analyze the soundscape and then predict the four outcomes I've just talked about. Or start at the bottom  and say what outcomes do we want  and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect. At last we've got some science we can apply. And we're in the business of designing soundscapes. Just a word on music. Music is the most powerful sound there is  often inappropriately deployed. It's powerful for two reasons. You recognize it fast  and you associate it very powerfully. I'll give you two examples.  First chord of The Beatles'  A Hard Day's Night   Most of you recognize that immediately. The younger  maybe not.  Laughter  Now  those are one second samples of music. Music is very powerful. And unfortunately it's veneering commercial spaces  often inappropriately. I hope that's going to change over the next few years. Let me just talk about brands for a moment  because some of you run brands. Every brand is out there making sound right now. There are eight expressions of a brand in sound. They are all important. And every brand needs to have guidelines at the center. I'm glad to say that is starting to happen now. You all recognize that one.  Nokia ringtone  This is the most played tune in the world today.  .  billion times a day  that tune is played. And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing. Just leave you with four golden rules  for those of you who run businesses  for commercial sound. First  make it congruent  pointing in the same direction as your visual communication. That increases impact by over       percent. If your sound is pointing the opposite direction  incongruent  you reduce impact by    percent. That's an order of magnitude  up or down. This is important. Secondly  make it appropriate to the situation. Thirdly  make it valuable. Give people something with the sound. Don't just bombard them with stuff. And  finally  test and test it again. Sound is complex. There are many countervailing influences. It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti  sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens. So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness. If you're listening consciously  you can take control of the sound around you. It's good for your health. It's good for your productivity. If we all do that we move to a state that I like to think will be sound living in the world. I'm going to leave you with a little bit more birdsong.  Birds chirping  I recommend at least five minutes a day  but there is no maximum dose. Thank you for lending me your ears today.\n",
      "The Hindus say   Nada brahma   one translation of which is   The world is sound.  And in a way  that's true  because everything is vibrating. In fact  all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating. Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies. So you are  in fact  a chord    each of you an individual chord. One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony. Your ears can't hear that chord  they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear    octaves. Incidentally  we see just one octave. Your ears are always on    you have no ear lids. They work even when you sleep. The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters. The loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that. Ears are made not for hearing  but for listening. Listening is an active skill  whereas hearing is passive  listening is something that we have to work at    it's a relationship with sound. And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught. For example  have you ever considered that there are listening positions  places you can listen from  Here are two of them. Reductive listening is listening  for.  It reduces everything down to what's relevant and it discards everything that's not relevant. Men typically listen reductively. So he's saying   I've got this problem.  He's saying   Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next.  That's the way we talk  right guys  Expansive listening  on the other hand  is listening  with   not listening  for.  It's got no destination in mind    it's just enjoying the journey. Women typically listen expansively. If you look at these two  eye contact  facing each other  possibly both talking at the same time. Men  if you get nothing else out of this talk  practice expansive listening  and you can transform your relationships. The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise  surrounding us all the time. Noise like this  according to the European Union  is reducing the health and the quality of life of    percent of the population of Europe. Two percent of the population of Europe    that's    million people    are having their sleep devastated by noise like that. Noise kills         people a year in Europe. It's a really big problem. Now  when you were little  if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it  you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum. These days  you can do a similar thing  it just looks a bit cooler. It looks a bit like this. The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues. The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined   schizophonia.  It's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear. So  we're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us. I think there's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia. The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression. We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this. Listen to this    this is an uncompressed piece of music. And now the same piece of music with    percent of the data removed. I do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two. There is a cost of compression. It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data. You're having to imagine it. It's not good for you in the long run. The third problem with headphones is this  deafness    noise induced hearing disorder. Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another  but really worryingly     percent    roughly one in six    of American teenagers suffer from noise induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse. One study at an American university found that    percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse. We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people. Now that's a really serious problem. I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children  please. Professional hearing protectors are great  I use some all the time. If you're going to use headphones  buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don't have to have it so loud. If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice  it's too loud. And thirdly  if you're in bad sound  it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it. Protect your ears in that way. Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out. WWB  Wind  water  birds    stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events  all of it very healthy  all of it sound that we evolved to over the years. Seek those sounds out  they're good for you and so it this. Silence is beautiful. The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence. I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art. Have a foreground  a background  all in beautiful proportion. It's fun to get into designing with sound. If you can't do it yourself  get a professional to do it for you. Sound design is the future  and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds. I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities  eight ways sound can improve health. First  ultrasound  we're very familiar with it from physical therapy  it's also now being used to treat cancer. Lithotripsy    saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high intensity sound. Sound healing is a wonderful modality. It's been around for thousands of years. I do urge you to explore this. There are great things being done there  treating now autism  dementia and other conditions. And music  of course. Just listening to music is good for you  if it's music that's made with good intention  made with love  generally. Devotional music  good    Mozart  good. There are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy. And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved. First of all  listen consciously. I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that. It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension. Secondly  get in touch with making some sound    create sound. The voice is the instrument we all play  and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice  Get trained  learn to sing  learn to play an instrument. Musicians have bigger brains    it's true. You can do this in groups as well. It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia  to make music and sound in a group of people  whichever style you enjoy particularly. And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us. Protect your ears  Yes  absolutely. Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work. And let's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that I played you early on. So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound. My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things  we will take a very big step in that direction. So I urge you to take that path. I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong  which is very good for you. I wish you sound health.\n",
      "Interpreter  Piano   p   is my favorite musical symbol. It means to play softly. If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a  p  in the score  you need to play softer. Two p's    even softer. Four p's    extremely soft. This is my drawing of a p tree  which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be  you'll never reach complete silence. That's my current definition of silence  a very obscure sound. I'd like to share a little bit about the history of American Sign Language  ASL  plus a bit of my own background. French sign language was brought to America during the early     s  and as time went by  mixed with local signs  it evolved into the language we know today as ASL. So it has a history of about     years. I was born deaf  and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life. And I believed it to be true. Yet  I realize now that that wasn't the case at all. Sound was very much a part of my life  really  on my mind every day. As a Deaf person living in a world of sound  it's as if I was living in a foreign country  blindly following its rules  customs  behaviors and norms without ever questioning them. So how is it that I understand sound  Well  I watch how people behave and respond to sound. You people are like my loudspeakers  and amplify sound. I learn and mirror that behavior. At the same time  I've learned that I create sound  and I've seen how people respond to me. Thus I've learned  for example ...  Don't slam the door    Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato chip bag    Don't burp  and when you're eating  make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate.  All of these things I term  sound etiquette.  Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does. I'm hyper vigilant around sound. And I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound  about what's to come next. Hence  this drawing. TBD  to be decided. TBC  to be continued. TBA  to be announced. And you notice the staff    there are no notes contained in the lines. That's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears. In Deaf culture  movement is equivalent to sound. This is a sign for  staff  in ASL. A typical staff contains five lines. Yet for me  signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn't feel natural. That's why you'll notice in my drawings  I stick to four lines on paper. In the year       I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin  Germany  for an artist residency there. Prior to this time  I had been working as a painter. During this summer  I visited different museums and gallery spaces  and as I went from one place to the next  I noticed there was no visual art there. At that time  sound was trending  and this struck me ... there was no visual art  everything was auditory. Now sound has come into my art territory. Is it going to further distance me from art  I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all. I actually know sound. I know it so well that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears. It could be felt tactually  or experienced as a visual  or even as an idea. So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice. And everything that I had been taught regarding sound  I decided to do away with and unlearn. I started creating a new body of work. And when I presented this to the art community  I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received. I realized  sound is like money  power  control    social currency. In the back of my mind  I've always felt that sound was your thing  a hearing person's thing. And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork  or it could empower me. I chose to be empowered. There's a massive culture around spoken language. And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate  in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all. So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice. And that way  I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today. So at school  at work and institutions  I work with many different ASL interpreters. And their voice becomes my voice and identity. They help me to be heard. And their voices hold value and currency. Ironically  by borrowing out their voices  I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency  kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate. If I didn't continue this practice  I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency. So with sound as my new art medium  I delved into the world of music. And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL. For example  a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper. And the same holds true for a concept in ASL. They're both highly spatial and highly inflected    meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds. I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor  to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works. So  envision a piano. ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters. If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano    such as facial expression  body movement  speed  hand shape and so on  as you play the piano    English is a linear language  as if one key is being pressed at a time. However  ASL is more like a chord    all    fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL. If just one of those keys were to change the chord  it would create a completely different meaning. The same applies to music in regards to pitch  tone and volume. In ASL  by playing around with these different grammatical parameters  you can express different ideas. For example  take the sign TO LOOK AT. This is the sign TO LOOK AT. I'm looking at you. Staring at you. Oh    busted. Uh oh. What are you looking at  Aw  stop. I then started thinking   What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens   If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over  it could become like a piece of visual music. For example  this is the sign for  day   as the sun rises and sets. This is  all day.  If I was to repeat it and slow it down  visually it looks like a piece of music. All ... day. I feel the same holds true for  all night.   All night.  This is ALL NIGHT  represented in this drawing. And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights   last night    overnight   I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two. This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time. For example   H is one hand   H is two hand  present tense happens closest and in front of the body  future is in front of the body and the past is to your back. So  the first example is  a long time ago.  Then  past    used to  and the last one  which is my favorite  with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it   once upon a time.   Common time  is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure. Yet when I see the word  common time   what automatically comes to mind for me is  at the same time.  So notice RH  right hand  LH  left hand. We have the staff across the head and the chest.  Head  RH  Flash claw   Common time   Chest  LH  Flash claw  I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the  flash claw.  Can you please follow along with me  Everybody  hands up. Now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest  kind of like  common time  or at the same time. Yes  got it. That means  to fall in love  in International  Sign . International  Sign   as a note  is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world. The second one I'd like to demonstrate is this    please follow along with me again. And now this. This is  colonization  in ASL. Now the third    please follow along again. And again. This is  enlightenment  in ASL. So let's do all three together.  Fall in love    colonization  and  enlightenment.  Good job  everyone. Notice how all three signs are very similar  they all happen at the head and the chest  but they convey quite different meanings. So it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving  just like music is. However  in this day and age  we live in a very audio centric world. And just because ASL has no sound to it  it automatically holds no social currency. We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency    without sound. And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society. And maybe people will understand that you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL  nor do you have to be hearing to learn music. ASL is such a rich treasure that I'd like you to have the same experience. And I'd like to invite you to open your ears  to open your eyes  take part in our culture and experience our visual language. And you never know  you might just fall in love with us. Thank you. Denise Kahler Braaten  Hey  that's me.\n",
      "I became an inventor by accident. I was out of the air force in     . No  no  that's not true  I went in in       came out in       was working at the University of Washington  and I came up with an idea  from reading a magazine article  for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm. Now  that was before cassette tapes  C.D.s  DVDs    any of the cool stuff we've got now. And it was an arm that  instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record  went straight  a radial  linear tracking tone arm. And it was the hardest invention I ever made  but it got me started  and I got really lucky after that. And without giving you too much of a tirade  I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today  my   th invention. No  that's not true either. Golly  I'm just totally losing it. My   th patent  about the   th invention. I call this hypersonic sound. I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes  but I want to make an analogy before I do to this. I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say  That's really cool  but what's it good for  And I say  What is the light bulb good for  Sound  light  I'm going to draw the analogy. When Edison invented the light bulb  pretty much looked like this. Hasn't changed that much. Light came out of it in every direction. Before the light bulb was invented  people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it  focus it a little bit  put lenses in front of it  focus it a little bit better. Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused. Now  think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb  but you couldn't focus light  if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to. That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are. You turn on the loudspeaker  and after almost    years of having those gadgets  the sound just kind of goes where it wants. Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone  it's pretty much every direction. A little bit of differential  but not much. If the light bulb was the way the speaker is  and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it  we wouldn't have that  or movies in general  or computers  or T.V. sets  or C.D.s  or DVDs    and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light. Now  after almost    years of having sound  I thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to. I have a couple of units. That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car    small version  over your head    so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car. What if I could aim sound the way I aim light  I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard. Now  you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you. Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room. The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool  Because I have some limited time  I'll cut it off for a second  and tell you about how it works and what it's good for. Course  like light  it's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack  or the cornflakes  or the toothpaste  or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby. Sony's got an idea    Sony's our biggest customers right now. They tried this back in the '  s and were too smart  and so they gave up. But they want to use it    seriously. There's a mix an inventor has to have. You have to be kind of smart  and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid  because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today. Too many other smart people out there. So. I just happened to get my education in a little different way. I'm not at all against education. I think it's wonderful  I think sometimes people  when they get educated  lose it  they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than. And we're living in a great time right now  because almost everything's being explored anew. I have this little slogan that I use a lot  which is  virtually nothing    and I mean this honestly    has been invented yet. We're just starting. We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics. And this is  I hope  a little piece of it. Sony's got this vision back    to get myself on track    that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket  you're going to watch a new T.V. channel. They know that when you watch T.V. at home  because there are so many choices you can change channels  miss their commercials. A hundred and fifty one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket. Now  they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed  because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every    minutes  and reaches out  turns off the sound. And  you know  if the sound isn't there  the sale typically isn't made. For instance  like  when you're on an airplane  they show the movie  you get to watch it for free  when you want to hear the sound  you pay. And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket    initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways  they're trying this in three parts of the country right now    you'll be watching TV. And hopefully they'll be sensitive that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet. But what's great about it  from the tests that have been done  is  if you don't want to hear it  you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it. So  we create silence as much as we create sound. ATMs that talk to you  nobody else hears it. Sit in bed  two in the morning  watch TV  your spouse  or someone  is next to you  asleep  doesn't hear it  doesn't wake up. We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring  noise from automobiles. I have been really lucky with this technology  all of a sudden as it is ready  the world is ready to accept it. They have literally beat a path to our door. We've been selling it since about last September  October  and it's been immensely gratifying. If you're interested in what it costs    I'm not selling them today    but this unit  with the electronics and everything  if you buy one  is around a thousand bucks. We expect by this time next year  it'll be hundreds  a few hundred bucks  to buy it. It's not any more pricey than regular electronics. Now  when I played it for you  you didn't hear the thunderous bass. This unit that I played goes from about     hertz to above the range of hearing. It's actually emitting ultrasound    low level ultrasound    that's about         vibrations per second. And the sound that you're hearing  unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face  is made out in front of it  in the air. The air is not linear  as we've always been taught. You turn up the volume just a little bit    I'm talking about a little over    decibels    and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate. Here's why  the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow. It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure. Now  imagine  if you will  without getting too technical  I'm making a little sine wave here in the air. Well  if I turn up the amplitude too much  I'm having an effect on the pressure  which means during the making of that sine wave  the speed at which it is propagating is shifting. All of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear. Linearity means higher quality sound. Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite  it's     percent based on non linearity. An effect happens in the air  it's a corrupting effect of the sound    the ultrasound in this case    that's emitted  but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect. Now  the question is  where's the sound made  Instead of being made on the face of the cone  it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air  and so when I aim it towards you  what you hear is made right next to your ears. I said we can shorten the column  we can spread it out to cover the couch. I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker  the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound. When you listen to stereo on your home system  your both ears hear both speakers. Turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear. So  the stage is more restricted    the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you. Because the sound is made in the air along this column  it does not follow the inverse square law  which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance   dB every time you go from one meter  for instance  to two meters. That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony  and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row  now  all of a sudden. Isn't that terrific  So  we've been  as I say  very successful  very lucky  in having companies catch the vision of this  from cars    car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids  and a separate system in the back    oh  no  the kids aren't driving today. I was seeing if you were listening. Actually  I haven't had breakfast yet. A stereo system in the front for mom and dad  and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids  and the parents don't want to be bothered with that  or their rap music or whatever. So  again  this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on. It also works for transmitting and communicating data. It also works five times better underwater. We've got the military    have just deployed some of these into Iraq  where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside. Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse. I'm serious. And they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance  and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift from     yards away when they play this thing. And so  another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't. We make a version with this which puts out     decibels. Pain is    . So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people  and there can be a public beach just off to the side  and they don't even know it's turned on. We sell those to the military presently for about        dollars  and they're buying them as fast as we can make them. We put it on a turret with a camera  so that when they shoot at you  you're over there  and it's there. I have a bunch of other inventions. I invented a plasma antenna  to shift gears. Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day    I was working on a ground penetrating radar project    and my physicist CEO came in and said   We have a real problem. We're using very short wavelengths. We've got a problem with the antenna ringing. When you run very short wavelengths  like a tuning fork the antenna resonates  and there's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we're trying to analyze  taking too much processing.  I says   Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it  Turn it on  turn it off. That's a fluorescent tube refined.  I just sold that for a million and a half dollars  cash. I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified  when the patent issued  and told the people back there about it  and they laughed  and then I took them back a demo and they bought. Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone    the little cell headphones  That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars. Big mistake  it just sold for    million dollars two years ago. I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer in my attic at my house  and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back when. So  I've been really lucky as an inventor. I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet. And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe  hopefully  make something out of themselves. You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place. I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group. Let me give you  in the last minute  one more quick demo of this guy  for those of you that haven't heard it. Can never tell if it's on. If you haven't heard it  raise your hand. Getting it over there  Get the cameraman. Yeah  there you go. I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head  that's really cool. Thank you once again. Appreciate it very much.\n",
      "We are losing our listening. We spend roughly    percent of our communication time listening  but we're not very good at it. We retain just    percent of what we hear. Now not you  not this talk  but that is generally true. Let's define listening as making meaning from sound. It's a mental process  and it's a process of extraction. We use some pretty cool techniques to do this. One of them is pattern recognition. if I say   David  Sara  pay attention   some of you just sat up. We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal  and especially our name. Differencing is another technique we use. If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes  you would literally cease to hear it. We listen to differences  we discount sounds that remain the same. And then there is a whole range of filters. These filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to. Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters. But they actually create our reality in a way  because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now. Give you one example of that  Intention is very important in sound  in listening. When I married my wife  I promised her that I would listen to her every day as if for the first time. Now that's something I fall short of on a daily basis. But it's a great intention to have in a relationship. But that's not all. Sound places us in space and in time. If you close your eyes right now in this room  you're aware of the size of the room from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces. And you're aware of how many people are around you because of the micro noises you're receiving. And sound places us in time as well  because sound always has time embedded in it. In fact  I would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future. So   Sonority is time and meaning     a great quote. I said at the beginning  we're losing our listening. Why did I say that  Well there are a lot of reasons for this. First of all  we invented ways of recording    first writing  then audio recording and now video recording as well. The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared. Secondly  the world is now so noisy  visually and auditorily  it's just hard to listen  it's tiring to listen. Many people take refuge in headphones  but they turn big  public spaces like this  shared soundscapes  into millions of tiny  little personal sound bubbles. In this scenario  nobody's listening to anybody. We're becoming impatient. We don't want oratory anymore  we want sound bites. And the art of conversation is being replaced    dangerously  I think    by personal broadcasting. I don't know how much listening there is in this conversation  which is sadly very common  especially in the U.K. We're becoming desensitized. Our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines in order to get our attention. And that means it's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet  the subtle  the understated. This is a serious problem that we're losing our listening. This is not trivial. Because listening is our access to understanding. Conscious listening always creates understanding. And only without conscious listening can these things happen    a world where we don't listen to each other at all  is a very scary place indeed. So I'd like to share with you five simple exercises  tools you can take away with you  to improve your own conscious listening. Would you like that  The first one is silence. Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again. If you can't get absolute silence  go for quiet  that's absolutely fine. Second  I call this the mixer. and we all spend a lot of time in places like this    listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear  How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to  You can do it in a beautiful place as well  like in a lake. How many birds am I hearing  Where are they  Where are those ripples  It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening. Third  this exercise I call savoring  and this is a beautiful exercise. It's about enjoying mundane sounds. This  for example  is my tumble dryer. One  two  three. One  two  three. One  two  three. I love it. Or just try this one on for size. Wow  So mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention. I call that the hidden choir. It's around us all the time. The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these  if you just take one thing away. This is listening positions    the idea that you can move your listening position to what's appropriate to what you're listening to. This is playing with those filters. Do you remember  I gave you those filters at the beginning. It's starting to play with them as levers  to get conscious about them and to move to different places. These are just some of the listening positions  or scales of listening positions  that you can use. There are many. Have fun with that. It's very exciting. And finally  an acronym. You can use this in listening  in communication. If you're in any one of those roles    and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk    the acronym is RASA  which is the Sanskrit word for juice or essence. And RASA stands for Receive  which means pay attention to the person  Appreciate  making little noises like  hmm    oh    okay   Summarize  the word  so  is very important in communication  and Ask  ask questions afterward. Now sound is my passion  it's my life. I wrote a whole book about it. So I live to listen. That's too much to ask from most people. But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully    connected in space and in time to the physical world around us  connected in understanding to each other  not to mention spiritually connected  because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart. That's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill. Why is it not taught  It's crazy. And if we can teach listening in our schools  we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous  scary world that I talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time    or at least capable of doing it. Now I don't know how to do that  but this is TED  and I think the TED community is capable of anything. So I invite you to connect with me  connect with each other  take this mission out and let's get listening taught in schools  and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world    a world of connection  a world of understanding and a world of peace. Thank you for listening to me today.\n",

      "What I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives at multiple levels  over multiple timescales. And when I look out in the future  I can't imagine a world      years from now  where we don't have robots everywhere. Assuming    despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future    assuming we're still around  I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots. And then the question is  well  if they're going to be here in     years  are they going to be everywhere sooner than that  Are they going to be around in    years  Yeah  I think that's pretty likely    there's going to be lots of robots everywhere. And in fact I think that's going to be a lot sooner than that. I think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common  and I think we're sort of around      or      in personal computer years  where the first few robots are starting to appear. Computers sort of came around through games and toys. And you know  the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play Pong  a little microprocessor embedded  and then other games that came after that. And we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots  LEGO Mindstorms  Furbies    who here    did anyone here have a Furby  Yeah  there's    million of them sold worldwide. They are pretty common. And they're a little tiny robot  a simple robot with some sensors  a little bit of processing actuation. On the right there is another robot doll  who you could get a couple of years ago. And just as in the early days  when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers  you can now get various hacking kits  how to hack books. And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics  where you put a PC on  and you program this thing with a GUI to wander around your house and do various stuff. And then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys    the Sony Aibo. And on the right there  is one that the NEC developed  the PaPeRo  which I don't think they're going to release. But nevertheless  those sorts of things are out there. And we've seen  over the last two or three years  lawn mowing robots  Husqvarna on the bottom  Friendly Robotics on top there  an Israeli company. And then in the last    months or so we've started to see a bunch of home cleaning robots appear. The top left one is a very nice home cleaning robot from a company called Dyson  in the U.K. Except it was so expensive          dollars    they didn't release it. But at the bottom left  you see Electrolux  which is on sale. Another one from Karcher. At the bottom right is one that I built in my lab about    years ago  and we finally turned that into a product. And let me just show you that. We're going to give this away I think  Chris said  after the talk. This is a robot that you can go out and buy  and that will clean up your floor. And it starts off sort of just going around in ever increasing circles. If it hits something    you people see that  Now it's doing wall following  it's following around my feet to clean up around me. Let's see  let's    oh  who stole my Rice Krispies  They stole my Rice Krispies  Don't worry  relax  no  relax  it's a robot  it's smart  See  the three year old kids  they don't worry about it. It's grown ups that get really upset. We'll just put some crap here. Okay. I don't know if you see    so  I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there  I put some pennies  let's just shoot it at that  see if it cleans up. Yeah  OK. So    we'll leave that for later. Part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism  actually  the intelligence on board was fairly simple. And that's true with a lot of robots. We've all  I think  become  sort of computational chauvinists  and think that computation is everything  but the mechanics still matter. Here's another robot  the PackBot  that we've been building for a bunch of years. It's a military surveillance robot  to go in ahead of troops    looking at caves  for instance. But we had to make it fairly robust  much more robust than the robots we build in our labs. On board that robot is a PC running Linux. It can withstand a    G shock. The robot has local intelligence  it can flip itself over  can get itself into communication range  can go upstairs by itself  et cetera. Okay  so it's doing local navigation there. A soldier gives it a command to go upstairs  and it does. That was not a controlled descent. Now it's going to head off. And the big breakthrough for these robots  really  was September   th. We had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening. Couldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile  things were just too    there was nothing left to do. But we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated  and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into. Let's run this video. Reporter  ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks. Nick Robertson has that story. Rodney Brooks  Can we have another one of these  Okay  good. So  this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously. He's sending robots into caves  looking at what's going on. The robot's being totally autonomous. The worst thing that's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters. So one year ago  the US military didn't have these robots. Now they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day. And that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening. There's a sea change happening in how    where technology's going. Thanks. And over the next couple of months  we're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground. Very hostile environments       C         PSI. Autonomous robots going down  doing this sort of work. But robots like this  they're a little hard to program. How  in the future  are we going to program our robots and make them easier to use  And I want to actually use a robot here    a robot named Chris    stand up. Yeah. Okay. Come over here. Now notice  he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff. He sort of does that. But I'm going to    Chris Anderson  I'm just British. RB  Oh. I'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task. Now notice  he nodded there  he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication. And if I'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me  and regulated the conversation. So now I brought this up in front of him. I'd looked at his eyes  and I saw his eyes looked at this bottle top. And I'm doing this task here  and he's checking up. His eyes are going back and forth up to me  to see what I'm looking at    so we've got shared attention. And so I do this task  and he looks  and he looks to me to see what's happening next. And now I'll give him the bottle  and we'll see if he can do the task. Can you do that  Okay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good  good  good. I didn't show you how to do that. Now see if you can put it back together. And he thinks a robot has to be really slow. Good robot  that's good. So we saw a bunch of things there. We saw when we're interacting  we're trying to show someone how to do something  we direct their visual attention. The other thing communicates their internal state to us  whether he's understanding or not  regulates a social interaction. There was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing  and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end. And we've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future. I just want to show you one technical diagram here. The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system. Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing and interacting with  and what you're understanding what it's doing. So in the videos I'm about to show you  you're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has    it looks for skin tone in HSV space  so it works across all human colorings. It looks for highly saturated colors  from toys. And it looks for things that move around. And it weights those together into an attention window  and it looks for the highest scoring place    the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening    and that is what its eyes then segue to. And it looks right at that. At the same time  some top down sort of stuff  might decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone  or might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with. And so these weights change. And over here on the right  this is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module. Did people see the movie  AI    Audience  Yes.  RB  Yeah  it was really bad  but    remember  especially when Haley Joel Osment  the little robot  looked at the blue fairy for       years without taking his eyes off it  Well  this gets rid of that  because this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative  and more and more intense as it looks at one thing. And it gets bored  so it will then look away at something else. So  once you've got that    and here's a robot  here's Kismet  looking around for a toy. You can tell what it's looking at. You can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera  and you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy. And it's got a little bit of an emotional response here. But it's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view    such as Cynthia Breazeal  the builder of this robot  from the right. It sees her  pays attention to her. Kismet has an underlying  three dimensional emotional space  a vector space  of where it is emotionally. And at different places in that space  it expresses    can we have the volume on here  Can you hear that now  out there   Audience  Yeah.  Kismet  Do you really think so  Do you really think so  Do you really think so  RB  So it's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice. And when I was dealing with my robot over here  Chris  the robot  was measuring the prosody in my voice  and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages that mothers give their children pre linguistically. Here we've got naive subjects praising the robot  Voice  Nice robot. You're such a cute little robot. RB  And the robot's reacting appropriately. Voice  ...very good  Kismet. Voice  Look at my smile. RB  It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot. These are naive subjects. Here we asked them to get the robot's attention and indicate when they have the robot's attention. Voice  Hey  Kismet  ah  there it is. RB  So she realizes she has the robot's attention. Voice  Kismet  do you like the toy  Oh. RB  Now  here they're asked to prohibit the robot  and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner. Voice  No. No. You're not to do that. No. Not appropriate. No. No. RB  I'm going to leave it at that. We put that together. Then we put in turn taking. When we talk to someone  we talk. Then we sort of raise our eyebrows  move our eyes  give the other person the idea it's their turn to talk. And then they talk  and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other. So we put this in the robot. We got a bunch of naive subjects in  we didn't tell them anything about the robot  sat them down in front of the robot and said  talk to the robot. Now what they didn't know was  the robot wasn't understanding a word they said  and that the robot wasn't speaking English. It was just saying random English phonemes. And I want you to watch carefully  at the beginning of this  where this person  Ritchie  who happened to talk to the robot for    minutes       says   I want to show you something. I want to show you my watch.  And he brings the watch center  into the robot's field of vision  points to it  gives it a motion cue  and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully. We don't know whether he understood or not that the robot    Notice the turn taking. Ritchie  OK  I want to show you something. OK  this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. Robot  Oh  cool. Ritchie  Yeah  look  it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week. RB  So it's making eye contact with him  following his eyes. Ritchie  Can you do the same thing  Robot  Yeah  sure. RB  And they successfully have that sort of communication. And here's another aspect of the sorts of things that Chris and I were doing. This is another robot  Cog. They first make eye contact  and then  when Christie looks over at this toy  the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she's looking at. So we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs. But then the big questions  two big questions that people ask me are  if we make these robots more and more human like  will we accept them  will we    will they need rights eventually  And the other question people ask me is  will they want to take over  And on the first    you know  this has been a very Hollywood theme with lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here    where in each of these cases  the robots want more respect. Well  do you ever need to give robots respect  They're just machines  after all. But I think  you know  we have to accept that we are just machines. After all  that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us. You don't see a description of how  you know  Molecule A  you know  comes up and docks with this other molecule. And it's moving forward  you know  propelled by various charges  and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect. It's all mechanistic. We are mechanism. If we are machines  then in principle at least  we should be able to build machines out of other stuff  which are just as alive as we are. But I think for us to admit that  we have to give up on our special ness  in a certain way. And we've had the retreat from special ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years  at least.     years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun      years ago  with Darwin  we had to give up the idea we were different from animals. And to imagine    you know  it's always hard for us. Recently we've been battered with the idea that maybe we didn't even have our own creation event  here on earth  which people didn't like much. And then the human genome said  maybe we only have        genes. And that was really    people didn't like that  we've got more genes than that. We don't like to give up our special ness  so  you know  having the idea that robots could really have emotions  or that robots could be living creatures    I think is going to be hard for us to accept. But we're going to come to accept it over the next    years or so. And the second question is  will the machines want to take over  And here the standard scenario is that we create these things  they grow  we nurture them  they learn a lot from us  and then they start to decide that we're pretty boring  slow. They want to take over from us. And for those of you that have teenagers  you know what that's like. But Hollywood extends it to the robots. And the question is  you know  will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us  And that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard  you know     I accidentally built a    .  I don't think that's going to happen. And I don't think       I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with. We'll    you know  they're not going to have a super bad robot. Before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot  and before that a not so bad robot. And we're just not going to let it go that way. So  I think I'm going to leave it at that  the robots are coming  we don't have too much to worry about  it's going to be a lot of fun  and I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next    years.\n",
      "Good morning. I'm here today to talk about autonomous flying beach balls. No  agile aerial robots like this one. I'd like to tell you a little bit about the challenges in building these  and some of the terrific opportunities for applying this technology. So these robots are related to unmanned aerial vehicles. However  the vehicles you see here are big. They weigh thousands of pounds  are not by any means agile. They're not even autonomous. In fact  many of these vehicles are operated by flight crews that can include multiple pilots  operators of sensors  and mission coordinators. What we're interested in is developing robots like this    and here are two other pictures    of robots that you can buy off the shelf. So these are helicopters with four rotors  and they're roughly a meter or so in scale  and weigh several pounds. And so we retrofit these with sensors and processors  and these robots can fly indoors. Without GPS. The robot I'm holding in my hand is this one  and it's been created by two students  Alex and Daniel. So this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound. It consumes about    watts of power. And as you can see  it's about eight inches in diameter. So let me give you just a very quick tutorial on how these robots work. So it has four rotors. If you spin these rotors at the same speed  the robot hovers. If you increase the speed of each of these rotors  then the robot flies up  it accelerates up. Of course  if the robot were tilted  inclined to the horizontal  then it would accelerate in this direction. So to get it to tilt  there's one of two ways of doing it. So in this picture  you see that rotor four is spinning faster and rotor two is spinning slower. And when that happens  there's a moment that causes this robot to roll. And the other way around  if you increase the speed of rotor three and decrease the speed of rotor one  then the robot pitches forward. And then finally  if you spin opposite pairs of rotors faster than the other pair  then the robot yaws about the vertical axis. So an on board processor essentially looks at what motions need to be executed and combines these motions  and figures out what commands to send to the motors        times a second. That's basically how this thing operates. So one of the advantages of this design is when you scale things down  the robot naturally becomes agile. So here  R is the characteristic length of the robot. It's actually half the diameter. And there are lots of physical parameters that change as you reduce R. The one that's most important is the inertia  or the resistance to motion. So it turns out the inertia  which governs angular motion  scales as a fifth power of R. So the smaller you make R  the more dramatically the inertia reduces. So as a result  the angular acceleration  denoted by the Greek letter alpha here  goes as   over R. It's inversely proportional to R. The smaller you make it  the more quickly you can turn. So this should be clear in these videos. On the bottom right  you see a robot performing a     degree flip in less than half a second. Multiple flips  a little more time. So here the processes on board are getting feedback from accelerometers and gyros on board  and calculating  like I said before  commands at     times a second  to stabilize this robot. So on the left  you see Daniel throwing this robot up into the air  and it shows you how robust the control is. No matter how you throw it  the robot recovers and comes back to him. So why build robots like this  Well  robots like this have many applications. You can send them inside buildings like this  as first responders to look for intruders  maybe look for biochemical leaks  gaseous leaks. You can also use them for applications like construction. So here are robots carrying beams  columns and assembling cube like structures. I'll tell you a little bit more about this. The robots can be used for transporting cargo. So one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity. So you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads. This is a picture of a recent experiment we did    actually not so recent anymore    in Sendai  shortly after the earthquake. So robots like this could be sent into collapsed buildings  to assess the damage after natural disasters  or sent into reactor buildings  to map radiation levels. So one fundamental problem that the robots have to solve if they are to be autonomous  is essentially figuring out how to get from point A to point B. So this gets a little challenging  because the dynamics of this robot are quite complicated. In fact  they live in a    dimensional space. So we use a little trick. We take this curved    dimensional space  and transform it into a flat  four dimensional space. And that four dimensional space consists of X  Y  Z  and then the yaw angle. And so what the robot does  is it plans what we call a minimum snap trajectory. So to remind you of physics  You have position  derivative  velocity  then acceleration  and then comes jerk  and then comes snap. So this robot minimizes snap. So what that effectively does  is produce a smooth and graceful motion. And it does that avoiding obstacles. So these minimum snap trajectories in this flat space are then transformed back into this complicated    dimensional space  which the robot must do for control and then execution. So let me show you some examples of what these minimum snap trajectories look like. And in the first video  you'll see the robot going from point A to point B  through an intermediate point. So the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory. So these are circular trajectories  where the robot pulls about two G's. Here you have overhead motion capture cameras on the top that tell the robot where it is     times a second. It also tells the robot where these obstacles are. And the obstacles can be moving. And here  you'll see Daniel throw this hoop into the air  while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop  and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop. So as an academic  we're always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs  and we get our robots to do that. So another thing the robot can do is it remembers pieces of trajectory that it learns or is pre programmed. So here  you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum  and then changes its orientation and then recovers. So it has to do this because this gap in the window is only slightly larger than the width of the robot. So just like a diver stands on a springboard and then jumps off it to gain momentum  and then does this pirouette  this two and a half somersault through and then gracefully recovers  this robot is basically doing that. So it knows how to combine little bits and pieces of trajectories to do these fairly difficult tasks. So I want change gears. So one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size. And I told you earlier that we may want to employ lots and lots of robots to overcome the limitations of size. So one difficulty is  How do you coordinate lots of these robots  And so here  we looked to nature. So I want to show you a clip of Aphaenogaster desert ants  in Professor Stephen Pratt's lab  carrying an object. So this is actually a piece of fig. Actually you take any object coated with fig juice  and the ants will carry it back to the nest. So these ants don't have any central coordinator. They sense their neighbors. There's no explicit communication. But because they sense the neighbors and because they sense the object  they have implicit coordination across the group. So this is the kind of coordination we want our robots to have. So when we have a robot which is surrounded by neighbors    and let's look at robot I and robot J    what we want the robots to do  is to monitor the separation between them  as they fly in formation. And then you want to make sure that this separation is within acceptable levels. So again  the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands     times a second  which then translates into motor commands      times a second. So this also has to be done in a decentralized way. Again  if you have lots and lots of robots  it's impossible to coordinate all this information centrally fast enough in order for the robots to accomplish the task. Plus  the robots have to base their actions only on local information    what they sense from their neighbors. And then finally  we insist that the robots be agnostic to who their neighbors are. So this is what we call anonymity. So what I want to show you next is a video of    of these little robots  flying in formation. They're monitoring their neighbors' positions. They're maintaining formation. The formations can change. They can be planar formations  they can be three dimensional formations. As you can see here  they collapse from a three dimensional formation into planar formation. And to fly through obstacles  they can adapt the formations on the fly. So again  these robots come really close together. As you can see in this figure eight flight  they come within inches of each other. And despite the aerodynamic interactions with these propeller blades  they're able to maintain stable flight. So once you know how to fly in formation  you can actually pick up objects cooperatively. So this just shows that we can double  triple  quadruple the robots' strength  by just getting them to team with neighbors  as you can see here. One of the disadvantages of doing that is  as you scale things up    so if you have lots of robots carrying the same thing  you're essentially increasing the inertia  and therefore you pay a price  they're not as agile. But you do gain in terms of payload carrying capacity. Another application I want to show you    again  this is in our lab. This is work done by Quentin Lindsey  who's a graduate student. So his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss like elements. So his algorithm tells the robot what part to pick up  when  and where to place it. So in this video you see    and it's sped up        times    you see three different structures being built by these robots. And again  everything is autonomous  and all Quentin has to do is to give them a blueprint of the design that he wants to build. So all these experiments you've seen thus far  all these demonstrations  have been done with the help of motion capture systems. So what happens when you leave your lab  and you go outside into the real world  And what if there's no GPS  So this robot is actually equipped with a camera  and a laser rangefinder  laser scanner. And it uses these sensors to build a map of the environment. What that map consists of are features    like doorways  windows  people  furniture    and it then figures out where its position is  with respect to the features. So there is no global coordinate system. The coordinate system is defined based on the robot  where it is and what it's looking at. And it navigates with respect to those features. So I want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by Frank Shen and Professor Nathan Michael  that shows this robot entering a building for the very first time  and creating this map on the fly. So the robot then figures out what the features are  it builds the map  it figures out where it is with respect to the features  and then estimates its position     times a second  allowing us to use the control algorithms that I described to you earlier. So this robot is actually being commanded remotely by Frank  but the robot can also figure out where to go on its own. So suppose I were to send this into a building  and I had no idea what this building looked like. I can ask this robot to go in  create a map  and then come back and tell me what the building looks like. So here  the robot is not only solving the problem of how to go from point A to point B in this map  but it's figuring out what the best point B is at every time. So essentially it knows where to go to look for places that have the least information  and that's how it populates this map. So I want to leave you with one last application. And there are many applications of this technology. I'm a professor  and we're passionate about education. Robots like this can really change the way we do K    education. But we're in Southern California  close to Los Angeles  so I have to conclude with something focused on entertainment. I want to conclude with a music video. I want to introduce the creators  Alex and Daniel  who created this video. So before I play this video  I want to tell you that they created it in the last three days  after getting a call from Chris. And the robots that play in the video are completely autonomous. You will see nine robots play six different instruments. And of course  it's made exclusively for TED     . Let's watch.\n",
      "So just by a show of hands  how many of you all have a robot at home  Not very many of you. Okay. And actually of those hands  if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home  So a couple. That's okay. That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive    that I and the other    nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving. So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use  whether you're eight or   . And as it turns out  that's a really hard problem  because you have to build a small  portable robot that's not only really affordable  but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids. This robot can't be creepy or uncanny. He should be friendly and cute. So meet Romo. Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love    your iPhone    as his brain. And by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor  we can create a robot that is wi fi enabled and computer vision capable for     bucks  which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past. When Romo wakes up  he's in creature mode. So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face. If I duck down  he'll follow me. He's wary  so he'll keep his eyes on me. If I come over here  he'll turn to follow me. If I come over here     Laughs  He's smart. And if I get too close to him  he gets scared just like any other creature. So in a lot of ways  Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own. Thanks  little guy. Bless you. And if I want to explore the world    uh oh  Romo's tired    if I want to explore the world with Romo  I can actually connect him from any other iOS device. So here's the iPad. And Romo will actually stream video to this device. So I can see everything that Romo sees  and I get a robot's eye view of the world. Now this is a free app on the App Store  so if any of you guys had this app on your phones  we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together. So I'll show you really quickly  Romo actually    he's streaming video  so you can see me and the entire TED audience. If I get in front of Romo here. And if I want to control him  I can just drive. So I can drive him around  and I can take pictures of you. I've always wanted a picture of a       person TED audience. So I'll snap a picture. And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad  I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device. So there are all of you through Romo's eyes. And finally  because Romo is an extension of me  I can express myself through his emotions. So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited. But the most important thing about Romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive. You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo. In fact  who would like to drive a robot  Okay. Awesome. Here you go. Thank you  Scott. And even cooler  you actually don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him. So he actually streams two way audio and video between any two smart devices. So you can log in through the browser  and it's kind of like Skype on wheels. So we were talking before about telepresence  and this is a really cool example. You can imagine an eight year old girl  for example  who has an iPhone  and her mom buys her a robot. That girl can take her iPhone  put it on the robot  send an email to Grandma  who lives on the other side of the country. Grandma can log into that robot and play hide and go seek with her granddaughter for fifteen minutes every single night  when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year. Thanks  Scott. So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today. But I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future. This is actually something that one of our engineers  Dom  built in a weekend. It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly. This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want. You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo. And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser  which is what you see Romo doing on the left. And then if you have something you like  you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life  run the program in real life. And then if you have something you're proud of  you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world. So all of these wi fi enabled robots actually learn from each other. The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal. They change from person to person. So we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home  that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination. So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like. To be honest  I have no idea. But what we do know is that it isn't    years or    billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away. The future of personal robotics is happening today  and it's going to depend on small  agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves. So we can't wait to get you all robots  and we can't wait to see what you build. Thank you.\n",
      "My job is to design  build and study robots that communicate with people. But this story doesn't start with robotics at all  it starts with animation. When I first saw Pixar's  Luxo Jr.   I was amazed by how much emotion they could put into something as trivial as a desk lamp. I mean  look at them    at the end of this movie  you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture. And I said  I have to learn how to do this. So I made a really bad career decision. And that's what my mom was like when I did it. I left a very cozy tech job in Israel at a nice software company and I moved to New York to study animation. And there I lived in a collapsing apartment building in Harlem with roommates. I'm not using this phrase metaphorically    the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room. Whenever they did news stories about building violations in New York  they would put the report in front of our building  as kind of  like  a backdrop to show how bad things are. Anyway  during the day  I went to school and at night I would sit and draw frame by frame of pencil animation. And I learned two surprising lessons. One of them was that when you want to arouse emotions  it doesn't matter so much how something looks  it's all in the motion  in the timing of how the thing moves. And the second was something one of our teachers told us. He actually did the weasel in  Ice Age.  And he said   As an animator  you're not a director    you're an actor.  So  if you want to find the right motion for a character  don't think about it    go use your body to find it. Stand in front of a mirror  act it out in front of a camera    whatever you need    and then put it back in your character. A year later I found myself at MIT in the Robotic Life Group. It was one of the first groups researching the relationships between humans and robots. And I still had this dream to make an actual  physical Luxo Jr. lamp. But I found that robots didn't move at all in this engaging way that I was used to from my animation studies. Instead  they were all    how should I put it    they were all kind of robotic. And I thought  what if I took whatever I learned in animation school  and used that to design my robotic desk lamp. So I went and designed frame by frame to try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible. And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop    and I'm actually redesigning the robot  so  unbeknownst to itself  it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me. I wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light  and more of a helpful  kind of quiet apprentice that's always there when you need it and doesn't really interfere. And when  for example  I'm looking for a battery that I can't find  in a subtle way  it'll show me where the battery is. So you can see my confusion here. I'm not an actor. And I want you to notice how the same mechanical structure can  at one point  just by the way it moves  seem gentle and caring and in the other case  seem violent and confrontational. And it's the same structure  just the motion is different. Actor   You want to know something  Well  you want to know something  He was already dead  Just laying there  eyes glazed over   But  moving in a graceful way is just one building block of this whole structure called human robot interaction. I was  at the time  doing my PhD  I was working on human robot teamwork  teams of humans and robots working together. I was studying the engineering  the psychology  the philosophy of teamwork  and at the same time  I found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation  with a good friend of mine  who's actually here. And in that situation  we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us. It was after a Passover Seder. We were folding up a lot of folding chairs  and I was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm. Everybody did their own part  we didn't have to divide our tasks. We didn't have to communicate verbally about this    it all just happened. And I thought  humans and robots don't look at all like this. When humans and robots interact  it's much more like a chess game  the human does a thing  the robot analyzes whatever the human did  the robot decides what to do next  plans it and does it. Then the human waits  until it's their turn again. So it's much more like a chess game  and that makes sense  because chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists. It's all about information  analysis  decision making and planning. But I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player  and more like a doer that just clicks and works together. So I made my second horrible career choice  I decided to study acting for a semester. I took off from the PhD  I went to acting classes. I actually participated in a play    I hope there s no video of that around still. And I got every book I could find about acting  including one from the   th century that I got from the library. And I was really amazed  because my name was the second name on the list    the previous name was in     . And this book was kind of waiting for     years to be rediscovered for robotics. And this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion that they want to express. But the real revelation was when I learned about method acting. It became very popular in the   th century. And method acting said you don't have to plan every muscle in your body  instead  you have to use your body to find the right movement. You have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body to find the right expression    improvise  play off your scene partner. And this came at the same time as I was reading about this trend in cognitive psychology  called embodied cognition  which also talks about the same ideas. We use our bodies to think  we don't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move  but our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave. And it was like a lightning bolt. I went back to my office  I wrote this paper  which I never really published  called  Acting Lessons for Artificial Intelligence.  And I even took another month to do what was then the first theater play with a human and a robot acting together. That's what you saw before with the actors. And I thought  How can we make an artificial intelligence model    a computer  computational model    that will model some of these ideas of improvisation  of taking risks  of taking chances  even of making mistakes  Maybe it can make for better robotic teammates. So I worked for quite a long time on these models and I implemented them on a number of robots. Here you can see a very early example with the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence to try to match my movements as closely as possible. It's sort of like a game. Let's look at it. You can see when I psych it out  it gets fooled. And it's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them. And then  I did another experiment  and I got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp  and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence. So  I actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot. The robot is the same lamp that you saw  and I put two brains in it. For one half of the people  I put in a brain that's kind of the traditional  calculated robotic brain. It waits for its turn  it analyzes everything  it plans. Let's call it the calculated brain. The other got more the stage actor  risk taker brain. Let's call it the adventurous brain. It sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know. It sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them. And I had them do this very tedious task that took almost    minutes  and they had to work together  somehow simulating  like  a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing. What I found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot. They thought it was more intelligent  more committed  a better member of the team  contributed to the success of the team more. They even called it  he  and  she   whereas people with the calculated brain called it  it   and nobody ever called it  he  or  she.  When they talked about it after the task  with the adventurous brain  they said   By the end  we were good friends and high fived mentally.  Whatever that means. Sounds painful. Whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy apprentice. It only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more  which is almost what people expect robots to do  so I was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing. And in a way  I thought  maybe it's time    just like method acting changed the way people thought about acting in the   th century  from going from the very calculated  planned way of behaving  to a more intuitive  risk taking  embodied way of behaving    maybe it's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution. A few years later  I was at my next research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta  and I was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians. And I thought  music  that's the perfect place to look at teamwork  coordination  timing  improvisation    and we just got this robot playing marimba. And the marimba  for everybody like me  it was this huge  wooden xylophone. And when I was looking at this  I looked at other works in human robot improvisation    yes  there are other works in human robot improvisation    and they were also a little bit like a chess game. The human would play  the robot analyzed what was played  and would improvise their own part. So  this is what musicians called a call and response interaction  and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence. But I thought  if I use the same ideas I used in the theater play and in the teamwork studies  maybe I can make the robots jam together like a band. Everybody's riffing off each other  nobody is stopping for a moment. And so I tried to do the same things  this time with music  where the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play  it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play  and does what my jazz teacher when I was    taught me. She said  when you improvise  sometimes you don't know what you're doing  and you still do it. So I tried to make a robot that doesn't actually know what it's doing  but is still doing it. So let's look at a few seconds from this performance  where the robot listens to the human musician and improvises. And then  look how the human musician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its behavior  and at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with. Being a musician is not just about making notes  otherwise nobody would ever go see a live show. Musicians also communicate with their bodies  with other band members  with the audience  they use their bodies to express the music. And I thought  we already have a robot musician on stage  why not make it be a full fledged musician  And I started designing a socially expressive head for the robot. The head doesn t actually touch the marimba  it just expresses what the music is like. These are some napkin sketches from a bar in Atlanta that was dangerously located exactly halfway between my lab and my home. So I spent  I would say  on average  three to four hours a day there. I think. And I went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like  but especially what a robotic musician would move like  to sort of show that it doesn't like what the other person is playing    and maybe show whatever beat it's feeling at the moment. So we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot  which was nice. I'm going to show you now the same kind of performance  this time with a socially expressive head. And notice one thing    how the robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human  while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing. And also how it changes the way it moves as soon as it starts its own solo. Now it's looking at me  showing that it's listening. Now look at the final chord of the piece again. And this time the robot communicates with its body when it's busy doing its own thing  and when it's ready to coordinate the final chord with me. Thanks. I hope you see how much this part of the body that doesn't touch the instrument actually helps with the musical performance. And at some point    we are in Atlanta  so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point    and we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the robot. Here you can see the robot basically responding to the beat. Notice two things  one  how irresistible it is to join the robot while it's moving its head. You kind of want to move your own head when it does it. And second  even though the rapper is really focused on his iPhone  as soon as the robot turns to him  he turns back. So even though it's just in the periphery of his vision  in the corner of his eye  it's very powerful. And the reason is that we can't ignore physical things moving in our environment. We are wired for that. So if you have a problem    maybe your partner is looking at their iPhone or smartphone too much    you might want to have a robot there to get their attention. Just to introduce the last robot that we've worked on  it came out of something surprising that we found  Some point people didn't care about the robot being intelligent  able to improvise and listen  and do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years developing. They really liked that the robot was enjoying the music. And they didn't say the robot was moving to the music  they said  enjoying  the music. And we thought  why don't we take this idea  and I designed a new piece of furniture. This time it wasn't a desk lamp  it was a speaker dock  one of those things you plug your smartphone in. And I thought  what would happen if your speaker dock didn't just play the music for you  but would actually enjoy it  too  And so again  here are some animation tests from an early stage. And this is what the final product looked like. So  a lot of bobbing heads. A lot of bobbing heads in the audience  so we can still see robots influence people. And it's not just fun and games. I think one of the reasons I care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body to move is    I'm going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding    is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in your life. Somewhere in your future  there will be a robot in your life. If not in yours  your children's lives. And I want these robots to be more fluent  more engaging  more graceful than currently they seem to be. And for that I think maybe robots need to be less like chess players and more like stage actors and more like musicians. Maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise. Maybe they should be able to anticipate what you're about to do. Maybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them  because in the end  we are human. And maybe as humans  robots that are a little less than perfect are just perfect for us. Thank you.\n",
      "I know this is going to sound strange  but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans. See  I grew up in Bethlehem  Pennsylvania  the home of Bethlehem Steel. My father was an engineer  and when I was growing up  he would teach me how things worked. We would build projects together  like model rockets and slot cars. Here's the go kart that we built together. That's me behind the wheel  with my sister and my best friend at the time. And one day  he came home  when I was about    years old  and at the dinner table  he announced that for our next project   we were going to build ... a robot. A robot. Now  I was thrilled about this  because at school  there was a bully named Kevin  and he was picking on me  because I was the only Jewish kid in class. So I couldn't wait to get started to work on this  so I could introduce Kevin to my robot. But that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind. See  he owned a chromium plating company  and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals. And so he needed an industrial robot like this  that could basically do the heavy lifting. But my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted  either. He and I worked on it for several years  but it was the     s  and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet. So Dad continued to do this kind of work by hand. And a few years later  he was diagnosed with cancer. You see  what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting. It was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals. He didn't recognize that at the time  and he contracted leukemia. And he died at the age of   . I was devastated by this. And I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build. When I was at college  I decided to study engineering  like him. And I went to Carnegie Mellon  and I earned my PhD in robotics. I've been studying robots ever since. So what I'd like to tell you about are four robot projects  and how they've inspired me to be a better human. By       I was a young professor at USC  and I was just building up my own robotics lab  and this was the year the World Wide Web came out. And I remember my students were the ones who told me about it  and we would    we were just amazed. We started playing with this  and that afternoon  we realized that we could use this new  universal interface to allow anyone in the world to operate the robot in our lab. So  rather than have it fight or do industrial work  we decided to build a planter  put the robot into the center of it  and we called it the Telegarden. And we had put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the robot  and we wrote some special scripts and software  so that anyone in the world could come in  and by clicking on the screen  they could move the robot around and visit the garden. But we also set up some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden  remotely. And if you watered it a few times  we'd give you your own seed to plant. Now  this was an engineering project  and we published some papers on the system design of it  but we also thought of it as an art installation. It was invited  after the first year  by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria  to have it installed in their lobby. And I'm happy to say  it remained online there     hours a day  for almost nine years. That robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history. Now  one day  I got a call out of the blue from a student  who asked a very simple but profound question. He said   Is the robot real   Now  everyone else had assumed it was  and we knew it was  because we were working with it. But I knew what he meant  because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then  basically  index them in a computer system  such that it would appear that there was a real robot  when there wasn't. And the more I thought about it  I couldn't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference. This was right about the time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley. And when I got here  I looked up Hubert Dreyfus  who's a world renowned professor of philosophy  And I talked with him about this and he said   This is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy. It goes back to the Skeptics and up through Descartes. It's the issue of epistemology  the study of how do we know that something is true.  So he and I started working together  and we coined a new term   telepistemology   the study of knowledge at a distance. We invited leading artists  engineers and philosophers to write essays about this  and the results are collected in this book from MIT Press. So thanks to this student  who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true  this project taught me an important lesson about life  which is to always question assumptions. Now  the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the Telegarden. As it was operating  my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other  and what they were doing with the garden. So we started thinking  what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment  Like  for example  what if it could go to a dinner party at the White House  So  because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware  we decided that  rather than have a robot replace the human to go to the party  we'd have a human replace the robot. We called it the Tele Actor. We got a human  someone who's very outgoing and gregarious  and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment  cameras and microphones  and then a backpack with wireless Internet connection. And the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment  and then over the Internet  people could experience what she was experiencing. So they could see what she was seeing  but then  more importantly  they could participate  by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go  and then conveying those to the Tele Actor. So we got a chance to take the Tele Actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco. And that year  Sam Donaldson was the host. Just before the curtain went up  I had about    seconds to explain to Mr. Donaldson what we were going to do. And I said   The Tele Actor is going to be joining you onstage. This is a new experimental project  and people are watching her on their screens  there's cameras involved and there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear  and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next.  And he said   Wait a second. That's what I do.  So he loved the concept  and when the Tele Actor walked onstage  she walked right up to him  and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips. We were totally surprised    we had no idea that would happen. And he was great  he just gave her a big hug in return  and it worked out great. But that night  as we were packing up  I asked the Tele Actor  how did the Tele Directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson  And she said they hadn't. She said  when she was just about to walk onstage  the Tele Directors still were trying to agree on what to do  and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural. So  the success of the Tele Actor that night was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor. She knew when to trust her instincts. And so that project taught me another lesson about life  which is that  when in doubt  improvise. Now  the third project grew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital. He was undergoing a treatment    chemotherapy treatments    and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy  where tiny  radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors. And the way it's done  as you can see here  is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds. And all these needles are inserted in parallel. So it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs. And as a result  the needles damage these organs  cause damage  which leads to trauma and side effects. So my students and I wondered  what if we could modify the system  so that the needles could come in at different angles  So we simulated this  we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this. And we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs  and yet still achieve the coverage of the tumors with the radiation. So now  we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins  and we're building a robot that has a number of    it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles. And as you can see here  they can avoid delicate organs and still reach the targets they're aiming for. So  by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel  this project also taught me an important lesson  When in doubt  when your path is blocked  pivot. And the last project also has to do with medical robotics. And this is something that's grown out of a system called the da Vinci surgical robot. And this is a commercially available device. It's being used in over       hospitals around the world. The idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame. Many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious  like suturing  and currently  all of these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon. So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time. And we've been wondering  what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks  and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the surgery  and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster  Now  it's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this. But it turns out my colleague Pieter Abbeel  who's here at Berkeley  has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example. So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters  do incredibly interesting  beautiful acrobatics  by watching human experts fly them. So we got one of these robots. We started working with Pieter and his students. And we asked a surgeon to perform a task    with the robot. So what we're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task  and we record the motions of the robot. So here's an example. I'll use tracing out a figure eight as an example. So here's what it looks like when the robot    this is what the robot's path looks like  those three examples. Now  those are much better than what a novice like me could do  but they're still jerky and imprecise. So we record all these examples  the data  and then go through a sequence of steps. First  we use a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition. And this allows us to temporally align all of the examples. And then we apply Kalman filtering  a technique from control theory  that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them. Now we take those human demonstrations    they're all noisy and imperfect    and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot. We then execute that on the robot  we observe what happens  then we adjust the controls  using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning. Then what we do is we increase the velocity a little bit. We observe the results  adjust the controls again  and observe what happens. And we go through this several rounds. And here's the result. That's the inferred task trajectory  and here's the robot moving at the speed of the human. Here's four times the speed of the human. Here's seven times. And here's the robot operating at    times the speed of the human. So we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like a surgical subtask  at    times the speed of a human. So this project also  because of its involved practicing and learning  doing something over and over again  this project also has a lesson  which is  if you want to do something well  there's no substitute for practice  practice  practice. So these are four of the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years. And the field of robotics has gotten much better over time. Nowadays  high school students can build robots  like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build. But  it's very    now ... And now  I have a daughter  named Odessa. She's eight years old. And she likes robots  too. Maybe it runs in the family. I wish she could meet my dad. And now I get to teach her how things work  and we get to build projects together. And I wonder what kind of lessons she'll learn from them. Robots are the most human of our machines. They can't solve all of the world's problems  but I think they have something important to teach us. I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in  the machines that you wish for. And think about what they might be telling you. Because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations  the devices we dream about  can inspire us to be better humans. Thank you.\n",

      "A few years ago  with my colleague  Emmanuelle Charpentier  I invented a new technology for editing genomes. It's called CRISPR Cas . The CRISPR technology allows scientists to make changes to the DNA in cells that could allow us to cure genetic disease. You might be interested to know that the CRISPR technology came about through a basic research project that was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections. Bacteria have to deal with viruses in their environment  and we can think about a viral infection like a ticking time bomb    a bacterium has only a few minutes to defuse the bomb before it gets destroyed. So  many bacteria have in their cells an adaptive immune system called CRISPR  that allows them to detect viral DNA and destroy it. Part of the CRISPR system is a protein called Cas   that's able to seek out  cut and eventually degrade viral DNA in a specific way. And it was through our research to understand the activity of this protein  Cas   that we realized that we could harness its function as a genetic engineering technology    a way for scientists to delete or insert specific bits of DNA into cells with incredible precision    that would offer opportunities to do things that really haven't been possible in the past. The CRISPR technology has already been used to change the DNA in the cells of mice and monkeys  other organisms as well. Chinese scientists showed recently that they could even use the CRISPR technology to change genes in human embryos. And scientists in Philadelphia showed they could use CRISPR to remove the DNA of an integrated HIV virus from infected human cells. The opportunity to do this kind of genome editing also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider  because this technology can be employed not only in adult cells  but also in the embryos of organisms  including our own species. And so  together with my colleagues  I've called for a global conversation about the technology that I co invented  so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications of a technology like this. What I want to do now is tell you what the CRISPR technology is  what it can do  where we are today and why I think we need to take a prudent path forward in the way that we employ this technology. When viruses infect a cell  they inject their DNA. And in a bacterium  the CRISPR system allows that DNA to be plucked out of the virus  and inserted in little bits into the chromosome    the DNA of the bacterium. And these integrated bits of viral DNA get inserted at a site called CRISPR. CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. A big mouthful    you can see why we use the acronym CRISPR. It's a mechanism that allows cells to record  over time  the viruses they have been exposed to. And importantly  those bits of DNA are passed on to the cells' progeny  so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation  but over many generations of cells. This allows the cells to keep a record of infection  and as my colleague  Blake Wiedenheft  likes to say  the CRISPR locus is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells. Once those bits of DNA have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome  the cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called RNA  which is orange in this picture  that is an exact replicate of the viral DNA. RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA  and it allows interaction with DNA molecules that have a matching sequence. So those little bits of RNA from the CRISPR locus associate    they bind    to protein called Cas   which is white in the picture  and form a complex that functions like a sentinel in the cell. It searches through all of the DNA in the cell  to find sites that match the sequences in the bound RNAs. And when those sites are found    as you can see here  the blue molecule is DNA    this complex associates with that DNA and allows the Cas  cleaver to cut up the viral DNA. It makes a very precise break. So we can think of the Cas  RNA sentinel complex like a pair of scissors that can cut DNA    it makes a double stranded break in the DNA helix. And importantly  this complex is programmable  so it can be programmed to recognize particular DNA sequences  and make a break in the DNA at that site. As I'm going to tell you now  we recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering  to allow cells to make a very precise change to the DNA at the site where this break was introduced. That's sort of analogous to the way that we use a word processing program to fix a typo in a document. The reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA and repair it. So when a plant or an animal cell detects a double stranded break in its DNA  it can fix that break  either by pasting together the ends of the broken DNA with a little  tiny change in the sequence of that position  or it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut. So if we have a way to introduce double stranded breaks into DNA at precise places  we can trigger cells to repair those breaks  by either the disruption or incorporation of new genetic information. So if we were able to program the CRISPR technology to make a break in DNA at the position at or near a mutation causing cystic fibrosis  for example  we could trigger cells to repair that mutation. Genome engineering is actually not new  it's been in development since the     s. We've had technologies for sequencing DNA  for copying DNA  and even for manipulating DNA. And these technologies were very promising  but the problem was that they were either inefficient  or they were difficult enough to use that most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories  or certainly for many clinical applications. So  the opportunity to take a technology like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal  because of its relative simplicity. We can think of older genome engineering technologies as similar to having to rewire your computer each time you want to run a new piece of software  whereas the CRISPR technology is like software for the genome  we can program it easily  using these little bits of RNA. So once a double stranded break is made in DNA  we can induce repair  and thereby potentially achieve astounding things  like being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia or cause Huntington's Disease. I actually think that the first applications of the CRISPR technology are going to happen in the blood  where it's relatively easier to deliver this tool into cells  compared to solid tissues. Right now  a lot of the work that's going on applies to animal models of human disease  such as mice. The technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell's DNA affect either a tissue or  in this case  an entire organism. Now in this example  the CRISPR technology was used to disrupt a gene by making a tiny change in the DNA in a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice. Imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome  and they're otherwise completely normal. And when we sequence the DNA from these animals  we find that the change in the DNA has occurred at exactly the place where we induced it  using the CRISPR technology. Additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease  such as monkeys. And here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues  for example  figuring out how to deliver the CRISPR tool into cells. We also want to understand better how to control the way that DNA is repaired after it's cut  and also to figure out how to control and limit any kind of off target  or unintended effects of using the technology. I think that we will see clinical application of this technology  certainly in adults  within the next    years. I think that it's likely that we will see clinical trials and possibly even approved therapies within that time  which is a very exciting thing to think about. And because of the excitement around this technology  there's a lot of interest in start up companies that have been founded to commercialize the CRISPR technology  and lots of venture capitalists that have been investing in these companies. But we have to also consider that the CRISPR technology can be used for things like enhancement. Imagine that we could try to engineer humans that have enhanced properties  such as stronger bones  or less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease or even to have properties that we would consider maybe to be desirable  like a different eye color or to be taller  things like that.  Designer humans   if you will. Right now  the genetic information to understand what types of genes would give rise to these traits is mostly not known. But it's important to know that the CRISPR technology gives us a tool to make such changes  once that knowledge becomes available. This raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider  and this is why I and my colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the CRISPR technology in human embryos  to give us time to really consider all of the various implications of doing so. And actually  there is an important precedent for such a pause from the     s  when scientists got together to call for a moratorium on the use of molecular cloning  until the safety of that technology could be tested carefully and validated. So  genome engineered humans are not with us yet  but this is no longer science fiction. Genome engineered animals and plants are happening right now. And this puts in front of all of us a huge responsibility  to consider carefully both the unintended consequences as well as the intended impacts of a scientific breakthrough. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Jennifer  this is a technology with huge consequences  as you pointed out. Your attitude about asking for a pause or a moratorium or a quarantine is incredibly responsible. There are  of course  the therapeutic results of this  but then there are the un therapeutic ones and they seem to be the ones gaining traction  particularly in the media. This is one of the latest issues of The Economist     Editing humanity.  It's all about genetic enhancement  it's not about therapeutics. What kind of reactions did you get back in March from your colleagues in the science world  when you asked or suggested that we should actually pause this for a moment and think about it  Jennifer Doudna  My colleagues were actually  I think  delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this openly. It's interesting that as I talk to people  my scientific colleagues as well as others  there's a wide variety of viewpoints about this. So clearly it's a topic that needs careful consideration and discussion. BG  There's a big meeting happening in December that you and your colleagues are calling  together with the National Academy of Sciences and others  what do you hope will come out of the meeting  practically  JD  Well  I hope that we can air the views of many different individuals and stakeholders who want to think about how to use this technology responsibly. It may not be possible to come up with a consensus point of view  but I think we should at least understand what all the issues are as we go forward. BG  Now  colleagues of yours  like George Church  for example  at Harvard  they say   Yeah  ethical issues basically are just a question of safety. We test and test and test again  in animals and in labs  and then once we feel it's safe enough  we move on to humans.  So that's kind of the other school of thought  that we should actually use this opportunity and really go for it. Is there a possible split happening in the science community about this  I mean  are we going to see some people holding back because they have ethical concerns  and some others just going forward because some countries under regulate or don't regulate at all  JD  Well  I think with any new technology  especially something like this  there are going to be a variety of viewpoints  and I think that's perfectly understandable. I think that in the end  this technology will be used for human genome engineering  but I think to do that without careful consideration and discussion of the risks and potential complications would not be responsible. BG  There are a lot of technologies and other fields of science that are developing exponentially  pretty much like yours. I'm thinking about artificial intelligence  autonomous robots and so on. No one seems    aside from autonomous warfare robots    nobody seems to have launched a similar discussion in those fields  in calling for a moratorium. Do you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields  JD  Well  I think it's hard for scientists to get out of the laboratory. Speaking for myself  it's a little bit uncomfortable to do that. But I do think that being involved in the genesis of this really puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility. And I would say that I certainly hope that other technologies will be considered in the same way  just as we would want to consider something that could have implications in other fields besides biology. BG  Jennifer  thanks for coming to TED. JD  Thank you.\n",
      "What I'm going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines that create the living fabric of your body. Now molecules are really  really tiny. And by tiny  I mean really. They're smaller than a wavelength of light  so we have no way to directly observe them. But through science  we do have a fairly good idea of what's going on down at the molecular scale. So what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules  but we don't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules. One way around this is to draw pictures. And this idea is actually nothing new. Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process. They draw pictures of what they're observing with their eyes  through technology like telescopes and microscopes  and also what they're thinking about in their minds. I picked two well known examples  because they're very well known for expressing science through art. And I start with Galileo who used the world's first telescope to look at the Moon. And he transformed our understanding of the Moon. The perception in the   th century was the Moon was a perfect heavenly sphere. But what Galileo saw was a rocky  barren world  which he expressed through his watercolor painting. Another scientist with very big ideas  the superstar of biology  is Charles Darwin. And with this famous entry in his notebook  he begins in the top left hand corner with   I think   and then sketches out the first tree of life  which is his perception of how all the species  all living things on Earth  are connected through evolutionary history    the origin of species through natural selection and divergence from an ancestral population. Even as a scientist  I used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible  with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work  until I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell  who is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute. And his pictures  everything's accurate and it's all to scale. And his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like. So this is a transection through blood. In the top left hand corner  you've got this yellow green area. The yellow green area is the fluids of blood  which is mostly water  but it's also antibodies  sugars  hormones  that kind of thing. And the red region is a slice into a red blood cell. And those red molecules are hemoglobin. They are actually red  that's what gives blood its color. And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body. I was very much inspired by this image many years ago  and I wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world. What would it look like  And that's how I really began. So let's begin. This is DNA in its classic double helix form. And it's from X ray crystallography  so it's an accurate model of DNA. If we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands  you see these things that look like teeth. Those are the letters of genetic code  the        genes you've got written in your DNA. This is what they typically talk about    the genetic code    this is what they're talking about. But I want to talk about a different aspect of DNA science  and that is the physical nature of DNA. It's these two strands that run in opposite directions for reasons I can't go into right now. But they physically run in opposite directions  which creates a number of complications for your living cells  as you're about to see  most particularly when DNA is being copied. And so what I'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body  at least      biology. So DNA's entering the production line from the left hand side  and it hits this collection  these miniature biochemical machines  that are pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy. So DNA comes in and hits this blue  doughnut shaped structure and it's ripped apart into its two strands. One strand can be copied directly  and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there. But things aren't so simple for the other strand because it must be copied backwards. So it's thrown out repeatedly in these loops and copied one section at a time  creating two new DNA molecules. Now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you  copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity. It's an accurate representation  and it's pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you. I've left out error correction and a bunch of other things. This was work from a number of years ago. Thank you. This is work from a number of years ago  but what I'll show you next is updated science  it's updated technology. So again  we begin with DNA. And it's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules  which I've stripped away so you can see something. DNA is about two nanometers across  which is really quite tiny. But in each one of your cells  each strand of DNA is about    to    million nanometers long. So to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code  it's wrapped around these purple proteins    or I've labeled them purple here. It's packaged up and bundled up. All this field of view is a single strand of DNA. This huge package of DNA is called a chromosome. And we'll come back to chromosomes in a minute. We're pulling out  we're zooming out  out through a nuclear pore  which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the DNA called the nucleus. All of this field of view is about a semester's worth of biology  and I've got seven minutes. So we're not going to be able to do that today  No  I'm being told   No.  This is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope. And it's been filmed under time lapse  which is why you can see it moving. The nuclear envelope breaks down. These sausage shaped things are the chromosomes  and we'll focus on them. They go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots. When the cell feels it's ready to go  it rips apart the chromosome. One set of DNA goes to one side  the other side gets the other set of DNA    identical copies of DNA. And then the cell splits down the middle. And again  you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you. Now we're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes and look at its structure and describe it. So again  here we are at that equator moment. The chromosomes line up. And if we isolate just one chromosome  we're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure. So this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have  at least as far as we've discovered so far inside of us. So this is a single chromosome. And you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome. One is bundled up into one sausage. The other strand is bundled up into the other sausage. These things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell. They're called mircrotubules. That name's not important. But what we're going to focus on is this red region    I've labeled it red here    and it's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes. It is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes. We have no idea really as to how it's achieving that movement. We've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study  and we're still just beginning to discover what it's all about. It is made up of about     different types of proteins  thousands of proteins in total. It is a signal broadcasting system. It broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell when it's ready  when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes. It is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules. It's involved with the growing of the microtubules  and it's able to transiently couple onto them. It's also an attention sensing system. It's able to feel when the cell is ready  when the chromosome is correctly positioned. It's turning green here because it feels that everything is just right. And you'll see  there's this one little last bit that's still remaining red. And it's walked away down the microtubules. That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal. And it's walked away. I mean  it's that mechanical. It's molecular clockwork. This is how you work at the molecular scale. So with a little bit of molecular eye candy  we've got kinesins  which are the orange ones. They're little molecular courier molecules walking one way. And here are the dynein. They're carrying that broadcasting system. And they've got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on. So again  this is all derived accurately from the science. The problem is we can't show it to you any other way. Exploring at the frontier of science  at the frontier of human understanding  is mind blowing. Discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science. But most medical researchers    discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals  which are to eradicate disease  to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty. Thank you.\n",
      "We're here today to announce the first synthetic cell  a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer  building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals  assembling that chromosome in yeast  transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species. So this is the first self replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer. It also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code. But we'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute. This is a project that had its inception    years ago when our team then    we called the institute TIGR    was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history. We did Haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self replicating organism  that of Mycoplasma genitalium. And as soon as we had these two sequences we thought  if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self replicating species  could there be even a smaller genome  Could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level  It's been a    year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions  because it's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell. You can only do them one at a time. We decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route  even though nobody had been there before  to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life. That started our    year quest to get here. But before we did the first experiments  we actually asked Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks  the challenges  the ethics around creating new species in the laboratory were because it hadn't been done before. They spent about two years reviewing that independently and published their results in Science in     . Ham and I took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome  but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand. In       we started a new institute  the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives  where we set out two goals  One  to understand the impact of our technology on the environment  and how to understand the environment better  and two  to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life. In       we published our first success. So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed some new methods for making error free DNA at a small level. Our first task was a       letter code bacteriophage  a virus that attacks only E. coli. So that was the phage phi X      which was chosen for historical reasons. It was the first DNA phage  DNA virus  DNA genome that was actually sequenced. So once we realized that we could make       base pair viral sized pieces  we thought  we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome. So  substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially. There were several steps to this. There were two sides  We had to solve the chemistry for making large DNA molecules  and we had to solve the biological side of how  if we had this new chemical entity  how would we boot it up  activate it in a recipient cell. We had two teams working in parallel  one team on the chemistry  and the other on trying to be able to transplant entire chromosomes to get new cells. When we started this out  we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem  which is why we chose the smallest genome. And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one. And we can walk through the reasons for that  but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from  whereas the larger  faster growing cell takes only two days. So there's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle. And you should know that basically     probably    percent plus of our experiments failed. So this was a debugging  problem solving scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe of how to get there. So  one of the most important publications we had was in     . Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another. I think philosophically  that was one of the most important papers that we've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was. And we knew  once that worked  that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those. We didn't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there. In       we reported the complete synthesis of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome  a little over         letters of genetic code  but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome. We think in part  because of its slow growth and  in part  cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening. It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease  an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface  and was happy to eat the synthetic DNA that we gave it and never got transplantations. But at the time  that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made. And so both sides were progressing  but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast  putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us. It's an amazing step forward  but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast. So in addition to doing the transplant  we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell. So our team developed new techniques for actually growing  cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast. So we took the same mycoides genome that Carole had initially transplanted  and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome. And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them. When we did these experiments  though  we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell. That little issue took the team two years to solve. It turns out  the DNA in the bacterial cell was actually methylated  and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme  from digesting the DNA. So what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it  we could then transplant it. Further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell. And once we had done that  now we can take naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it. So last fall when we published the results of that work in Science  we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast. Because of the problems with Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago  we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome  the mycoides chromosome  knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation. And Dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one million base pair chromosome. But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end  and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence. So the team developed new debugging software  where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type DNA. And we found that    out of the            base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life forming sequence. We narrowed it down to one fragment  we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene. So accuracy is essential. There's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error  and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA  as we did with the watermarks  and it can tolerate all kinds of errors. So it took about three months to find that error and repair it. And then early one morning  at   a.m. we got a text from Dan saying that  now  the first blue colonies existed. So  it's been a long route to get here     years from the beginning. We felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic DNA from natural DNA. Early on  when you're working in a new area of science  you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you hadn't  and  even worse  leading others to believe it. So  we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome  leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell  when it would have been just a contaminant. So early on  we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic. And the first chromosome we built in         the         base pair one    we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code  but it was using just amino acid single letter translations  which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet. So the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code. So it's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in DNA. Now  mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time  but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because  if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed  it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions. So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons  so it's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire English alphabet with punctuation and numbers. So  there are four major watermarks all over       base pairs of genetic code. The first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code. So in the remaining information  in the watermarks  contain the names of  I think it's    different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage. And we also built in a website address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code  they can send an email to that address. So it's clearly distinguishable from any other species  having    names in it  its own web address. And we added three quotations  because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work. So we won't give the rest of the code  but we will give the three quotations. The first is   To live  to err  to fall  to triumph and to recreate life out of life.  It's a James Joyce quote. The second quotation is   See things not as they are  but as they might be.  It's a quote from the  American Prometheus  book on Robert Oppenheimer. And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote   What I cannot build  I cannot understand.  So  because this is as much a philosophical advance as a technical advance in science  we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side. The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we've done    asking for ethical review  pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side    this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community  in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government. Even with this announcement  as we did in         that work was funded by the Department of Energy  so the work was reviewed at the level of the White House  trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it. And they came down on the side of open publication  which is the right approach    we've briefed the White House  we've briefed members of Congress  we've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances. So with that  I would like to open it first to the floor for questions. Yes  in the back. Reporter  Could you explain  in layman's terms  how significant a breakthrough this is please  Craig Venter  Can we explain how significant this is  I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is. It's significant to us. Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change in how we view life. We actually view it as a baby step in terms of  it's taken us    years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do    years ago on understanding life at its basic level. But we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool. We have  at the Institute  ongoing funding now from NIH in a program with Novartis to try and use these new synthetic DNA tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year. Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these  Dan's team can now make these in less than    hours. So when you see how long it took to get an H N  vaccine out  we think we can shorten that process quite substantially. In the vaccine area  Synthetic Genomics and the Institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven't been possible to date  things where the viruses rapidly evolve  such with rhinovirus. Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds  Or  more importantly  HIV  where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can't keep up with those evolutionary changes. Also  at Synthetic Genomics  we've been working on major environmental issues. I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf is a reminder. We can't see CO     we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it    but we can see pre CO  now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf. We need some alternatives for oil. We have a program with Exxon Mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources  make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of CO . Those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we're taking.\n",
      "At the break  I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate. And this will be my only comment on it. And that is  I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists. What I'm going to tell you about in my    minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves. It's only    years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free living organism  that of haemophilus influenzae. That took a genome project from    years down to four months. We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours. So in the last decade  a large number of genomes have been added  most human pathogens  a couple of plants  several insects and several mammals  including the human genome. Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over    years ago was  by the end of this year  we might have between three and five genomes sequenced  it's on the order of several hundred. We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence     genomes this year  as a side project from environmental organisms. So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed. But as we look  what's out there  we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet. Most people don't realize it  because they're invisible  but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass  whereas all animals only make up about one one thousandth of all the biomass. And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often  but if you ever make it to the sea  and you swallow a mouthful of seawater  keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of    million viruses. Less than       microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago  and so we decided to do something about it. And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition  where we were  as with great oceanographic expeditions  trying to sample the ocean every     miles. We started in Bermuda for our test project  then moved up to Halifax  working down the U.S. East Coast  the Caribbean Sea  the Panama Canal  through to the Galapagos  then across the Pacific  and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean. It's very tough duty  we're doing this on a sailing vessel  in part to help excite young people about going into science. The experiments are incredibly simple. We just take seawater and we filter it  and we collect different size organisms on different filters  and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville  where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every    hours. And with doing this  we've made some amazing discoveries. For example  it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes    there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments. It turns out  almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors  and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication. From one site  from one barrel of seawater  we discovered  .  million new genes and as many as        new species. We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation. We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day  particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums. We filter through some simple apparatuses  we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City. And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time. Just on the data collection side  just where we are through the Galapagos  we're finding that almost every     miles  we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. Some of these make logical sense  in terms of different temperature gradients. So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures    red being warm  blue being cold    and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples  in terms of abundant species. The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light  and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence. And these vary tremendously from region to region. Maybe not surprisingly  in the deep ocean  where it's mostly blue  the photoreceptors tend to see blue light. When there's a lot of chlorophyll around  they see a lot of green light. But they vary even more  possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes. Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was  we assembled all the data    including all of ours thus far from the expedition  which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet    and it totaled around    million genes. And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are  Are we just discovering new members of known families  or are we discovering new families  And it turns out we have about        major gene families  but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families. So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes  components and life on this planet. When we look at the so called evolutionary tree  we're up on the upper right hand corner with the animals. Of those roughly    million genes  we only have around        in our genome. And if you take all animals together  we probably share less than        and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families. I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution. And we think in a gene centric view    maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas    than in a genome centric view  which are different constructs of these gene components. Synthetic DNA  the ability to synthesize DNA  has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two  and is getting very rapid and very cheap. Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in       and that from mycoplasma genitalium. And we have really nice T shirts that say  you know   I heart my genitalium.  This is actually just a microorganism. But it has roughly     genes. Haemophilus had       genes. And we simply asked the question  if one species needs      another      is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system  So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code. And if they insert in the middle of the gene  they disrupt its function. So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those  non essential genes.  But it turns out the environment is very critical for this  and you can only define an essential or non essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of    related organisms  and we tried to compare all of those  to see what they had in common. And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only     genes common to all    organisms. The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite  it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around     or so. So we think that we can expand or contract genomes  depending on your point of view here  to maybe     to     genes from the minimal of    . The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them  and we had to do this in a cassette based fashion. We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult. Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison  my colleagues on this  developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a       base pair virus in only a two week period that was     percent accurate  in terms of its sequence and its biology. It was a quite exciting experiment    when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA  injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden  that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria. This was not the first synthetic virus    a polio virus had been made a year before    but it was only one ten thousandth as active and it took three years to do. This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X    . This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware  and that's the notions that we have with biology. People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare  and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee  and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area. And I think it's important to keep reality in mind  versus what happens with people's imaginations. Basically  any virus that's been sequenced today    that genome can be made. And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox  but the DNA from this organism is not infective. So even if somebody made the smallpox genome  that DNA itself would not cause infections. The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses. And there's only two countries  the U.S. and the former Soviet Union  that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents. If that research is truly discontinued  there should be very little activity on the know how to make designer viruses in the future. I think single cell organisms are possible within two years. And possibly eukaryotic cells  those that we have  are possible within a decade. So we're now making several dozen different constructs  because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome. The key is  how do you put all of the others  We start with these fragments  and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome. This is derived from an organism  deinococcus radiodurans  that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed. It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about    to    hours  after its chromosomes are literally blown apart. This organism is ubiquitous on the planet  and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there. This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation. The glass started to burn and crack  while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier. Here's an actual picture of what happens  the top of this shows the genome after  .  million rads of radiation. The chromosome is literally blown apart. And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled    hours later. It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that  and we probably have thousands  if not tens of thousands  of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that. After these genomes are synthesized  the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome. So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential  not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues. For example  from the third organism we sequenced  Methanococcus jannaschii    it lives in boiling water temperatures  its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO  it captures back from the environment. So we know lots of different pathways  thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO   and can capture that back. So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes  we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere  converting that into biopolymers or other products. We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide  and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Also  there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane. And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products. Within a short while  I think there's going to be a new field called  Combinatorial Genomics   because with these new synthesis capabilities  these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination  we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day. And therefore  as with all biology  you get selection through screening  whether you're screening for hydrogen production  or chemical production  or just viability. To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach. We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight. Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen  and we have an oxygen insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process. We're also combining cellulases  the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol. Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes. The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce. I think future engineered species could be the source of food  hopefully a source of energy  environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry. Let me just close with ethical and policy studies. We delayed the start of our experiments in      until we completed a year and a half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species. Every major religion participated in this. It was actually a very strange study  because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books  and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life  so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this  but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them. Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multi institutional study on this  to work out what the risk and benefits to society are  and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area  and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward. These are complex issues. Except for the threat of bio terrorism  they're very simple issues in terms of  can we design things to produce clean energy  perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes. Thank you very much.\n",
      "This is a vending machine in Los Angeles. It's in a shopping mall  and it sells fish eggs. It's a caviar vending machine. This is the Art o mat  an art vending machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists  usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes  in limited edition. This is Oliver Medvedik. He's not a vending machine  but he is one of the founders of Genspace  a community biolab in Brooklyn  New York  where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry DNA. In fact  I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions about a year ago  and this is what led me onto this bizarre path that I'm going to talk to you right now. Because strawberry DNA is really  fascinating  because it's so beautiful. I'd never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before  before I saw it in this form. And a lot of people  especially in the art community  don't necessarily engage in science in this way. I instantly joined Genspace after this  and I asked Oliver   Well  if we can do this strawberries  can we do this with people as well   And about    minutes later  we were both spinning it in vials together and coming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction. And I started doing this on my own  and this is what my DNA actually looks like. And I was at a dinner party with some friends  some artist friends  and I was telling them about this project  and they couldn't believe that you could actually see DNA. So I said  all right  let's get out some supplies right now. And I started having these bizarre dinner  parties at my house on Friday nights where people would come over and we would do DNA extractions  and I would actually capture them on video  because it created this kind of funny portrait as well. These are people who don't necessarily regularly engage with science whatsoever. You can kind of tell from their reactions. But they became fascinated by it  and it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science. And so I started doing this regularly. It's kind of an odd thing to do with your Friday nights  but this is what I started doing  and I started collecting a whole group of my friends' DNA in small vials and categorizing them. This is what that looked like. And it started to make me think about a couple of things. First of all  this looked a lot like my Facebook wall. So in a way  I've created sort of a genetic network  a genetic social network  really. And the second thing was  one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like   Oh. Why are they numbered  Is this person more rare than the other one   And I hadn't even thought about that. They were just numbered because that was the order that I extracted the DNA in. But that made me think about collecting toys  and this thing that's going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys  and being able to collect these rare toys. You buy these boxes. You're not sure what's going to be inside of them. But then  when you open them up  you have different rarities of the toys. And so I thought that was interesting. I started thinking about this and the caviar vending machine and the Art o mat all together  and some reason  I was one night drawing a vending machine  thinking about doing paintings of a vending machine  and the little vial of my DNA was sitting there  and I saw this kind of beautiful collaboration between the strands of DNA and the coils of a vending machine. And so  of course  I decided to create an art installation called the DNA Vending Machine. Here it is.   DNA Vending Machine is an art installation about our increasing access to biotechnology.     For a reasonable cost  you can purchase a sample of human DNA from a traditional vending machine.     Each sample comes packaged with a collectible limited edition portrait of the human specimen.     DNA Vending Machine treats DNA as a collectible material and brings to light legal issues over the ownership of DNA.   Gabriel Garcia Colombo  So the DNA Vending Machine is currently in a couple galleries in New York  and it's selling out pretty well  actually. We're in the first edition of     pieces  hoping to do another edition pretty soon. I'd actually like to get it into more of a metro hub  like Grand Central or Penn Station  right next to some of the other  actual  vending machines in that location. But really with this project and a lot of my art projects I want to ask the audience a question  and that is  when biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as  say  laser cutting or  D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine  will you still submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine  And how much will these samples be worth  And will you buy someone else's sample  And what will you be able to do with that sample  Thank you.\n",

      "Welcome to Africa  Or rather  I should say  welcome home. Because this is where it all really began  isn't it  Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years    it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here. We are on an amazing journey the next four days. You're going to hear stories of  Africa  The Next Chapter.  Fantastic tales  anecdotes from speakers. But I want to turn that upside down for a moment  and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say. What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa  And this is not a rhetorical question. I actually want answers from you. Go for it  The worst. Famine. Corruption. More. Genocide. AIDS. Slavery. That's enough. We've all heard these things. But this is about Africa  the story we have not heard. The stories that we want to know  and the stories that do exist about positive tales. A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent  to separate the rhetoric from the reality  the fact from the fiction. To go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you. So let's get going because Africa  to some degree  is on a turnaround. A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image  and how it takes control of its own destiny. And turnarounds are part and parcel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career. And it all started almost a decade ago  as a young consultant at McKinsey   Company at their first African office in Johannesburg. And there we worked with leading CEOs on African issues  and African companies on turnarounds  making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally. But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds when I was completing my MBA in the United States. It all began with a fantastic phone call. It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter  Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine. And she said   I want to write a case  Euvin    a case on a public sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world.  And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela. Because Nelson Mandela  as he took over power as the first democratically elected president of South Africa  faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos. But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle. Now the case   Nelson Mandela  Change Leader   became part of the research base for a chapter in Rosabeth's new book called  Confidence.  And  Confidence  became a New York Times bestseller and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list. And why I tell you this story is because later  when I was interviewed on SABC Africa  on a pan African broadcast  they asked   What is your key lesson  or the key thing you enjoy the most      because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project. The lesson from that was that it was Africa    an African story    that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds. Africa was being used as a success story  So I want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation. And that has to do with me because in       I packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career. You should have seen my parents' reaction  But very soon  I found myself from the southern part of Africa  in South Africa    at the very north  in Egypt. And I sought out the most remote places. I went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops. And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things  but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him. And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert. Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm. And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle  and it foretold his destiny of greatness. This was     BC. So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers. Now  the thing I remember about Siwa was the magical view of the sky at night. With no natural light source  Siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry. Fast forward to     . I'm sitting in Cambridge  Massachusetts at the Healthcare Development Conference. And I see the same picture  but from the opposite side. A satellite picture looking down at the earth. And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me because I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment. And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point. The first thing that I saw was North America at night    glowing  in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light. And then I saw it    Africa. Quite literally the  Dark Continent.  And while Africa may be dark  the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing  but it's also the opportunity. Because whilst Africa may be dark    other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas    it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there. Entrepreneurs  dynamic people  people with hope. It was George Kimble  the geographer  who said that   The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it.  So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer. Let's start unpacking it. Africa is the second largest continent  a landmass second from Asia. It also is the second most populated continent  with     million people. In fact    coming back to the land mass    Africa is so big that you could fit in the continental United States  China  and the entire Europe into Africa  and still have space. Africa is home to over       languages          is another estimate that's out there    with over       languages and dialects. But you could say   Invest in Africa in over       languages  and it wouldn't make a difference.  What does the data say  As an investment banker  I'm in the cross flow of information and the changes that are taking place in capital markets. So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals  or signs  and winds of change that are sweeping this continent. So let's start on that. And let's start at the high level  on the macro factors. Inflation  in general  is coming down across Africa    that's the first sign    in many countries reaching double digit figures. So let's start looking at some of those. I call it my Z.E.N. cluster. Zambia  from      to       moves from the    percent in inflation to the nine percent. Egypt  from the    percent to about  .  percent. Nigeria  a similar situation  from the    percent to the eight percent. Single digits. More fascinating  you have other countries    South Africa  Mauritius  Namibia    all in single digits. But that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies    currencies going through an extreme time of stability. But that's looking at the big picture. And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country. It's made up    It's made up of    different countries. So the very definition    to say  invest in Africa  is a no go. It's meaningless. Each country has a unique value proposition. You can make money  you can lose money in Africa. But opportunities  boy oh boy  they exist. And this is what today is about    it's about discussing those very opportunities. So let's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data. I was recently elected  as Emeka mentioned  as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America. And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in. To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity  of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come. So the first port of call  let's talk a little bit about South Africa. But not the South Africa we always talk about    the gold  the minerals  the First World infrastructure    a bit about the other side of it. For example  South Africa was recently voted as the top destination for the top       UK companies for offshore call centers. Same language  timeline  et cetera. Makes sense. Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa were Bain Capital and KKR  the big boys of private equity. Headline in South Africa   They have landed.  Quite ominous. But what were they there for  To acquire assets. Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon  a large retailer  is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy. Because it is actually a long term play. Being a retailer  it is a play on the belief that this middle class that's growing will continue to grow  that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue. But the story of Africa  and my focus  is beyond South Africa because there's so much happening. Undoubtedly  Nigeria is clearly a hot spot. Challenges    and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days. But looking at Goldman Sachs' work    we had the famous BRIC Report. The new report   The Next Eleven   highlights that by      Nigeria is going to be amongst the top    economies in the world. It's an investment opportunity. Think about that. Is anyone    our banks  our investors    seriously thinking about going to Nigeria  If you haven't  why not  What's going on in Nigeria  A couple of things. I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets. Bellwether signs again. Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond out of Africa  and this excludes South Africa. But the first Eurobond  the raising of international capital offshore  off its own balance sheet  without any sovereign backing    that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy. Without any sovereign backing  a Nigerian company raising capital offshore. It's just a sign of things to come. Looking at the oil industry  Africa provides    percent of the U.S.'s oil supply  with the Middle East just    percent. It's an important strategic partner. Let's put Nigeria in perspective.  .  to  .  million barrels of oil a day    the same league as Kuwait  the same league as Venezuela. But with Africa  let's start being careful about this. And Emeka and I have had these discussions. We have to move away from what's called  the curse of the commodities.  Because it's not about oil  it's not about commodities. For Africa to truly be sustainable  we have to move beyond to other industries. So let's unpack those very quickly  and I'm going to move through these very  very  very fast because I can see that clock counting down. What else is going on there  Egypt. Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone     .  billion investment. The announcement just came out the last few weeks. Close to the Mediterranean  near Alexandria    textiles  petrochemicals. It's being managed by a Singaporean based management company. So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse across the industries    away from oil. Let's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry. What's going on there  In Tanzania last week  we had the launch of the East African Organic Produce Standard. Again  gathering together farmers  gathering together stakeholders in East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices. It ties in with small scale farmers in terms of no pesticides  no fertilizers. Again  opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price. Uganda  the New Forest Company  replanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important  As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed  we will need  poles for rolling out electricity. But here is the sweetener in the deal. They're going to be tapping into carbon credits. Let's go back to Nigeria. The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation  from over    banks to    banks. Strengthening of the system. But what's going on there  Only    percent of the country is banked. The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.     million plus people. Think about that. There are only     ATMs in the country. Opportunity. The same for telecoms across the country. Now let's look at the continent as a whole. People look at the roads  for example  and they'd say   Angola     percent of roads are untarred. Ah  problem   It's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up  inflation is affected. Nigeria     percent of roads are untarred. Zambia     percent. In general  more than    percent of roads are untarred. This is an opportunity  Energy needs    it's an opportunity. So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing  Let's look at the stock markets in Africa. If I had to ask you   In      what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world   Would Egypt come to mind  In       the Egyptian stock exchange returned over     percent. What's going on in some of the other countries  Let's look at some      numbers. Kenya  over    percent. Nigeria  over    percent. South Africa  in the    percents. High ones. These are the trends that are taking place. But in any investment decision  the key question is   What is my alternative investment   Because in Africa today  we are competing globally for capital. And global capital is agnostic    it has no loyalties. There's an overhang of capital in the U.S.  and the key is yield pickup. What Africa is providing is a diversification play  and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that's aware of what he or she is doing. Now  when looking at Africa vis a vis other things  and countries in Africa vis a vis other things  comparisons become important.    years ago there  were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard   Poors  Moody's and Fitch's. Today     African countries and growing have sovereign country ratings. What does this mean  Take Nigeria again  double B minus    in the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison. The backbone of making investment decisions for global holders of capital. Some other figures. South Africa  triple B plus. Botswana  A plus. Bakino Faso  B minus. And so on. In fact  one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa. Why are they doing that  Because they expect investment to follow. So one of the big bellwethers  and one of my final points I want to mention  is the interesting thing I read is that CNBC has launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this  It's the    hour rolling African news channel. They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen. Me and you  the investments we are going to be making  the investments the world is going to be making    that's the    hour news channel dedicated to Africa. So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline. So in conclusion  I want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago. This time  I'll  give you the entire picture that I saw in       and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa  think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent. Because there are amazing opportunities available. And think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly. In       Joseph Conrad released  The Heart of Darkness   a tale of grim horror along the Congo River. If one looks carefully  on the Congo River is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river generating light    the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro electric power. That is a transformation in power of ideas. So the next step  over the next four days  is us exploring more of these ideas. And perchance  if you can always keep this picture in your mind  that when we convene maybe in the distant future  in       that picture will look very different. Thank you.\n",
      "Well  first of all  let me thank Emeka    as a matter of fact  TED Global    for putting this conference together. This conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the   st century. Think African governments will put together a conference like this  You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this  Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid. I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows June Arunga  James Shikwati  Andrew  and the other TED Fellows. I call them the Cheetah Generation. The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption. They understand what accountability and democracy is. They're not going to wait for government to do things for them. That's the Cheetah Generation  and Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs. In contrast  of course  we have the Hippo Generation. The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites. They are stuck in their intellectual patch. Complaining about colonialism and imperialism  they wouldn't move one foot. If you ask them to reform the economies  they're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo. Now  there are a lot of Africans who are very angry  angry at the condition of Africa. Now  we're talking about a continent that is not poor. It is rich in mineral resources  natural mineral resources. But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty. That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry. And in a way  Africa is more than a tragedy  in more ways than one. There's another enduring tragedy  and that tragedy is that there are so many people  so many governments  so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa. They don't understand. Now  we're not saying don't help Africa. Helping Africa is noble. But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd. It's like the blind leading the clueless. There are certain things that we need to recognize. Africa's begging bowl leaks. Did you know that    percent of the wealth created in Africa is not invested here in Africa  It's taken out of Africa. That's what the World Bank says. Look at Africa's begging bowl. It leaks horribly. There are people who think that we should pour more money  more aid into this bowl which leaks. What are the leakages  Corruption alone costs Africa     billion dollars a year. Yes  put that aside. Capital flight out of Africa     billion a year. Put that aside. Let's take food imports. Every year Africa spends    billion dollars to import food. Just add that up  all these leakages. That's far more than the    billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa. Now  back in the     s Africa not only fed itself  it also exported food. Not anymore. We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong. You know it  I know it  but let's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here. Let's move on  and flip over to the next chapter  and that's what this conference is all about    the next chapter. The next chapter begins with first of all  asking ourselves this fundamental question   Whom do we want to help in Africa   There is the people  and then there is the government or leaders. Now  the previous speaker before me  Idris Mohammed  indicated that we've had abysmal leadership in Africa. That characterization  in my view  is even more charitable. I belong to an Internet discussion forum  an African Internet discussion forum  and I asked them  I said   Since       we've had exactly     African heads of state  since     .  And I asked them to name me just    good leaders  just    good leaders    you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself. I asked them to name me just   . Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela  of course. Kwame Nkrumah  Nyerere  Kenyatta    somebody mentioned Idi Amin. I let that pass. My point is  they couldn't go beyond   . Even if they had been able to name me     what does that tell you     out of     means that the vast majority of the African leaders failed their people. And if you look at them  the slate of the post colonial leaders    an assortment of military fufu heads  Swiss bank socialists  crocodile liberators  vampire elites  quack revolutionaries. Now  this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that Africans have known for centuries. The second false premise that we make when we're trying to help Africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in Africa that cares about its people  serves the interests of the people  and represents the people. There is one particular quote    a Lesotho chief once said that  Here in Lesotho  we've got two problems  rats and the government.  What you and I understand as a government doesn't exist in many African countries. In fact  what we call our governments are vampire states. Vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people. Government is the problem in Africa. A vampire state is the government       which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves  their cronies  and tribesmen and exclude everybody else. The richest people in Africa are heads of state and ministers  and quite often the chief bandit is the head of state himself. Where do they get their money  By creating wealth  No. By raking it off the backs of their suffering people. That's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution. The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the African people  we must know where the African people are. Take any African economy. An African economy can be broken up into three sectors. There is the modern sector  there is the informal sector and the traditional sector. The modern sector is the abode of the elites. It's the seat of government. In many African countries the modern sector is lost. It's dysfunctional. It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems  which the elites themselves don't understand. That is the source of many of Africa's problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector  claiming innocent lives. Now the modern sector  of course  is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into. More than    percent of Ivory Coast's development went into the modern sector. The other sectors  the informal and the traditional sectors  are where you find the majority of the African people  the real people in Africa. That's where you find them. Now  obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people  you go where the people are. But that's not what we did. As a matter of fact  we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors. Now  traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture  which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself  and that's why it must import food. All right  you cannot develop Africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors. And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work. These two sectors  let me describe to you  have their own indigenous institutions. First one is the political system. Traditionally  Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny. If you look into their traditional systems  Africans organize their states in two types. The first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous  so they didn't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority. These societies are the Ibo  the Somali  the Kikuyus  for example. They have no chiefs. The other ethnic groups  which did have chiefs  made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power. In Ashanti tradition  for example  the chief cannot make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elders. Without the council the chief can't pass any law  and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed. If not  the people will abandon the chief  go somewhere else and set up a new settlement. And even if you look in ancient African empires  they were all organized around one particular principle    the confederacy principle  which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority  decentralization of power. Now  this is what I have described to you. This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage. Now  compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on Africa. It is a total far cry. In the economic system in traditional Africa  the means of production is privately owned. It's owned by extended families. You see  in the West  the basic economic and social unit is the individual. The American will say   I am because I am  and I can damn well do anything I want  anytime.  The accent is on the  I.  In Africa  the Africans say   I am  because we are.  The  we  connotes community    the extended family system. The extended family system pools its resources together. They own farms. They decide what to do  what to produce. They don't take any orders from their chiefs. They decide what to do. And when they produce their crops  they sell the surplus on marketplaces. When they make a profit it is theirs to keep  not for the chief to sequester it from them. So  in a nutshell  what we had in traditional Africa was a free market system. There were markets in Africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent. Timbuktu was one great big market town. Kano  Salaga    they were all there. Even if you go to West Africa  you notice that market activity in West Africa has always been dominated by women. So  it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace. The market is not alien to Africa. What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism  but then after independence  all of a sudden  markets  capitalism became a western institution  and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism. Nonsense. And even then  what kind of socialism did they practice  The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of Swiss bank socialism  which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder Africa's treasuries for deposit in Switzerland. That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries. What do we do now  Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions  and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors  the traditional sectors. That's where you find the African people. And I'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector  about the boat building that I  myself  tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora to invest in. Could you please show that  The men are going fishing in these small boats. Yes  it's an enterprise. This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur  using his own capital. He's getting no assistance from the government  and he's building a second  bigger boat. A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed. It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians. It also means that he will be able to generate wealth. And then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy. All that you need to do  all that the elites need to do  is to move this operation into something that is enclosed so that the operation can be made more efficient. Now  it is not just this informal sector. There is also traditional medicine.    percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine. The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed. Now  this is an area    I mean  there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area. This is where we need to mobilize Africans  in the Diaspora especially  to invest in this. We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora  not only to go into the traditional sectors  but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within. We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana. And I know that with the Cheetahs  we can take Africa back one village at a time. Thank you very much.\n",
      "It began with one question  If Africa was a bar  what would your country be drinking or doing  I kicked it off with a guess about South Africa  which wasn't exactly according to the rules because South Africa's not my country. But alluding to the country's continual attempts to build a postracial society after being ravaged for decades by apartheid  I tweeted   ifafricawasabar South Africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging them to get along in its stomach. And then I waited. And then I had that funny feeling where I wondered if I crossed the line. So  I sent out a few other tweets about my own country and a few other African countries I'm familiar with. And then I waited again  but this time I read through almost every tweet I had ever tweeted to convince myself  no  to remind myself that I'm really funny and that if nobody gets it  that's fine. But luckily  I didn't have to do that for very long. Very soon  people were participating. In fact  by the end of that week in July  the hashtag  ifafricawasabar would have garnered around        tweets  lit up the continent and made its way to publications all over the world. People were using the hashtag to do many different things. To poke fun at their stereotypes    IfAfricaWasABar Nigeria would be outside explaining that he will pay the entrance fee  all he needs is the bouncer's account details.  To criticize government spending    ifafricawasabar South Africa would be ordering bottles it can't pronounce running a tab it won't be able to pay  To make light of geopolitical tensions    IfAfricaWasABar South Sudan would be the new guy with serious anger management issues.  To remind us that even in Africa there are some countries we don't know exist    IfAfricaWasABar Lesotho would be that person who nobody really knows but is always in the pictures.  And also to make fun of the countries that don't think that they're in Africa    IfAfricaWasABar Egypt  Libya  Tunisia  Algeria and Morocco be like  What the hell are we doing here      And to note the countries that had made a big turnaround    ifAfricawasabar Rwanda would be that girl that comes with no money and no transport but leaves drunk  happy and rich  But most importantly  people were using the hashtag to connect. People were connecting over their Africanness. So for one week in July  Twitter became a real African bar. And I was really thrilled  mainly because I realized that Pan Africanism could work  that we had before us  between us  at our fingertips a platform that just needed a small spark to light in us a hunger for each other. My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa  I'm    years old and I am Pan Africanist by birth. Now  I say I'm Pan Africanist by birth because my parents are from two different African countries. My father's from a country called Botswana in southern Africa. It's only slightly bigger than Germany. This year we celebrate our   th year of stable democracy. And it has some very progressive social policies. My mother's country is the Kingdom of Swaziland. It's a very  very small country  also in southern Africa. It is Africa's last complete monarchy. So it's been ruled by a king and a royal family in line with their tradition  for a very long time. On paper  these countries seem very different. And when I was a kid  I could see the difference. It rained a lot in one country  it didn't rain quite as much in the other. But outside of that  I didn't really realize why it mattered that my parents were from two different places. But it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me. You see  I was born in one country and raised in the other. When we moved to Botswana  I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati and nothing else. So I was being introduced to my new home  my new cultural identity  as a complete outsider  incapable of comprehending anything that was being said to me by the family and country whose traditions I was meant to move forward. But very soon  I would shed SiSwati. And when I would go back to Swaziland  I would be constantly confronted by how very non Swazi I was becoming. Add to that my entry into Africa's private school system  whose entire purpose is to beat the Africanness out of you  and I would have a very peculiar adolescence. But I think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here  in the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once but not really belonging to either one very well and belonging to this vast space in between and around simultaneously. I became obsessed with the idea of a shared African identity. Since then  I have continued to read about politics and geography and identity and what all those things mean. I've also held on to a deep curiosity about African philosophies. When I began to read  I gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon  who tackled complex ideas like decolonization and black consciousness. And when I thought  at     that I had digested these grand ideas  I moved on to the speeches of iconic African statesmen like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara and Congo's Patrice Lumumba. I read every piece of African fiction that I could get my hands on. So when Twitter came  I hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl whose friends are super  super bored of hearing about all this random stuff. The year was      and all over southern Africa and the whole continent  affordable data packages for smartphones and Internet surfing became much easier to get. So my generation  we were sending messages to each other on this platform that just needed     characters and a little bit of creativity. On long commutes to work  in lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to  on our lunch breaks  we would communicate as much as we could about the everyday realities of being young and African. But of course  this luxury was not available to everybody. So this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana and you wanted to have fun on the Internet  one  you had to tweet in English. Two  you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online. You had to follow South Africans  Zimbabweans  Ghanaians  Nigerians. And suddenly  your whole world opened up. And my whole world did open up. I followed vibrant Africans who were travelling around the continent  taking pictures of themselves and posting them under the hashtag  myafrica. Because at that time  if you were to search Africa on Twitter or on Google or any kind of social media  you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts. But Africans were using this platform to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors. It was Africans taking selfies on the beaches of Nigeria. It was Africans in cocktail bars in Nairobi. And these were the same Africans that I began to meet in my own travels around the continent. We would discuss African literature  politics  economic policy. But almost invariably  every single time  we would end up discussing Twitter. And that's when I realized what this was. We were standing in the middle of something amazing  because for the first time ever young Africans could discuss the future of our continent in real time  without the restriction of borders  finances and watchful governments. Because the little known truth is many Africans know a lot less about other African countries than some Westerners might know about Africa as a whole. This is by accident  but sometimes  it's by design. For example  in apartheid South Africa  black South Africans were constantly being bombarded with this message that any country ruled by black people was destined for failure. And this was done to convince them that they were much better off under crushing white rule than they were living in a black and free nation. Add to that Africa's colonial  archaic education system  which has been unthinkingly carried over from the     s    and at the age of     I could name all the various causes of the wars that had happened in Europe in the past     years  but I couldn't name the president of my neighboring country. And to me  this doesn't make any sense because whether we like it or not  the fates of African people are deeply intertwined. When disaster hits  when turmoil hits  we share the consequences. When Burundians flee political turmoil  they go to us  to other African countries. Africa has six of the world's largest refugee centers. What was once a Burundian problem becomes an African problem. So to me  there are no Sudanese problems or South African problems or Kenyan problems  only African problems because eventually  we share the turmoil. So if we share the problems  why aren't we doing a better job of sharing the successes  How can we do that  Well  in the long term  we can shoot towards increasing inter African trade  removing borders and putting pressure on leaders to fulfill regional agreements they've already signed. But I think that the biggest way for Africa to share its successes is to foster something I like to call social Pan Africanism. Now  political Pan Africanism already exists  so I'm not inventing anything totally new here. But political Pan Africanism is usually the African unity of the political elite. And who does that benefit  Well  African leaders  almost exclusively. No  what I'm talking about is the Pan Africanism of the ordinary African. Young Africans like me  we are bursting with creative energy  with innovative ideas. But with bad governance and shaky institutions  all of this potential could go to waste. On a continent where more than a handful of leaders have been in power longer than the majority of the populations has been alive  we are in desperate need of something new  something that works. And I think that thing is social Pan Africanism. My dream is that young Africans stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation. My dream is that when a young African comes up with something brilliant  they don't say   Well  this wouldn't work in my country   and then give up. My dream is that young Africans begin to realize that the entire continent is our canvas  is our home. Using the Internet  we can begin to think collaboratively  we can begin to innovate together. In Africa  we say   If you want to go fast  you go alone  but if you want to go far  you go together.  And I believe that social Pan Africanism is how we can go far together. And this is already happening. Access to these online networks has given young Africans something we've always had to violently take  a voice. We now have a platform. Before now  if you wanted to hear from the youth in Africa  you waited for the    year old minister of youth    to wake up in the morning  take his heartburn medication and then tell you the plans he has for your generation in    years time. Before now  if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government  you were pushed to protest  suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some Western paper somewhere might make someone care. But now we have opportunities to back each other up in ways we never could before. We support South African students who are marching against ridiculously high tertiary fees. We support Zimbabwean women who are marching to parliament. We support Angolan journalists who are being illegally detained. For the first time ever  African pain and African aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most  other Africans. I believe that with a social Pan Africanist thinking and using the Internet as a tool  we can begin to rescue each other  and ultimately  to rescue ourselves. Thank you.\n",
      "It was an incredible surprise to me to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life. Because  basically  I work as a theoretical physicist. I develop and test models of the Big Bang  using observational data. And I've been moonlighting for the last five years helping with a project in Africa. And  I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge. People wonder  you know   How do you have time to do this   And so on. And so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides. So I thought I'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why I lead this schizophrenic life. Well  I was born in South Africa and my parents were imprisoned for resisting the racist regime. When they were released  we left and we went as refugees to Kenya and Tanzania. Both were very young countries then  and full of hope for the future. We had an amazing childhood. We didn't have any money  but we were outdoors most of the time. We had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world  like Kilimanjaro  Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge. Well  then we moved to London for high school. And after that    there's nothing much to say about that. It was rather dull. But I came back to Africa at the age of     as a volunteer teacher to Lesotho  which is a tiny country  surrounded at that time by apartheid South Africa. Well     percent of the men in Lesotho worked in the mines over the border  in brutal conditions. Nevertheless  I    as I'm sure    as a rather irritating young  white man coming into their village  I was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth. But the kids were the best part. The kids were amazing  extremely eager and often very bright. And I'm just going to tell you one story  which got through to me. I used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible  to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world. And they weren't used to that. But I took them outside one day and I said   I want you to estimate the height of the building.  And I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall  size it up with a finger  and make an estimate of the height. But there was one little boy  very small for his age. He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village. And he wasn't doing that. He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement. And so  I said    I was annoyed    I said   What are you doing  I want you to estimate the height of the building.  He said   OK. I measured the height of a brick. I counted the number of bricks and now I'm multiplying.  Well     Laughter     I hadn't thought of that one. And many experiences like this happened to me. Another one is that I met a miner. He was home on his three month leave from the mines. Sitting next to him one day  he said   There's only one thing that I really loved at school. And you know what it was  Shakespeare.  And he recited some to me. And these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in Africa    inventive kids  intellectual kids    and starved of opportunity. And if Africa is going to get fixed  it's by them  not by us. Well  after     Applause     that's the truth. Well  after Lesotho  I traveled across Africa before returning to England    so gray and depressing  in comparison. And I went to Cambridge. And there  I fell for theoretical physics. Well  I'm not going to explain this equation  but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject. We can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line. And  admittedly  it's in a very shorthand notation. And it contains    free parameters  OK  which we have to fit to the data. So it's not the final story  but it's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level. And apart from a few very important loose ends  which you've heard about here    like dark energy and dark matter    this equation describes  seems to describe everything about the universe and what's in it. But there's one big puzzle remaining  and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in Tanzania  who's a wonderful Scottish lady who I still stay in touch with. And she's now in her   s. And when I try to explain my work to her  she waved away all the details  and she said   Neil  there's only one question that really matters. What banged    Laughter   Everyone talks about the Big Bang. What banged   And she's right. It's a question we've all been avoiding. The standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence  full of a strange kind of energy    inflationary energy    which blew it up. But the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely unsolved. Now  I worked on that theory for a while  with Stephen Hawking and others. But then I began to explore another alternative. The alternative is that the Big Bang wasn't the beginning. Perhaps the universe existed before the bang  and the bang was just a violent event in a pre existing universe. Well  this possibility is actually suggested by the latest theories  the unified theories  which try to explain all those    free parameters in a single framework  which will hopefully predict all of them. And I'll just share a cartoon of this idea here. It's all I can convey. According to these theories  there are extra dimensions of space  not just the three we're familiar with  but at every point in the room there are more dimensions. And in particular  there's one rather strange one  in the most elegant unified theories we have. The strange one looks likes this  that we live in a three dimensional world. We live in one of these worlds  and I can only show it as a sheet  but it's really three dimensional. And a tiny distance away  there's another sheet  also three dimensional  and they're separated by a gap. The gap is very tiny  and I've blown it up so you can see it. But it's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus. I won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this  but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know. Well  I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question. Which is  what happens if these two  three dimensional worlds should actually collide  And if they collide  it would look a lot like the Big Bang. But it's slightly different than in the conventional picture. The conventional picture of the Big Bang is a point. Everything comes out of a point  you have infinite density. And all the equations break down. No hope of describing that. In this picture  you'll notice  the bang is extended. It's not a point. The density of matter is finite  and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process. So  to cut a long story short  we've explored this alternative. We've shown that it can fit all of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies  the fluctuations in the microwave background. Furthermore  there's an experimental way to tell this theory  apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before. It involves gravitational waves. And in this scenario  not only was the Big Bang not the beginning  as you can see from the picture  it can happen over and over again. It may be that we live in an endless universe  both in space and in time. And there've been bangs in the past  and there will be bangs in the future. And maybe we live in an endless universe. Well  making and testing models of the universe is  for me  the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe. We need to make the best mathematical models we can  the most consistent ones. And then we scrutinize them  logically and with data. And we try to convince ourselves    we really try to convince ourselves they're wrong. That's progress  when we prove things wrong. And gradually  we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world. As I pursued my career  something was always gnawing away inside me. What about Africa  What about those kids I'd left behind  Instead of developing  as we'd all hoped in the '  s  things had gotten worse. Africa was gripped by poverty  disease and war. This is very graphically shown by the Worldmapper website and project. And so the idea is to represent each country on a map  but scale the area according to some quantity. So here's just the standard area map of the world. By the way  Africa is very large. And the next map now shows Africa's GDP in       around the time of independence for many African states. Now  this is       and then     . And here's a projection for     . Big changes are happening in the world  but they're not helping Africa. What about Africa's population  The population isn't out of proportion to its area  but Africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes  malnutrition  simple infections and birth complications. Then there's HIV AIDS. And then there are deaths from war. OK  currently there are        people a month dying in the Congo  as a consequence of the war there over coltan and diamonds and other things. It's still going on. What about Africa's capacity to do something about these problems  Well  here's the number of physicians in Africa. Here's the number of people in higher education. And here    most shocking to me    the number of scientific research papers coming out of Africa. It just doesn't exist scientifically. And this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa  that all of the aid that's been given has completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet. Well  the transition to democracy in South Africa in      was literally a dream come true for many of us. My parents were both elected to the first parliament  alongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela. They were the only other couple. And in       I took a research leave to visit them. And while I was busy working    I was working on these colliding worlds  in the day. But I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills  especially mathematical skills  in industry  in government  in education. The ability to make and test models has become essential  not only to every single area of science today  but also to modern society itself. And if you don't have math  you're not going to enter the modern age. So I had an idea. And the idea was very simple. The idea was to set up an African Institute for Mathematical Sciences  or AIMS. And let's recruit students from the whole of Africa  bring them together with lecturers from all over the world  and we'll try to give them a fantastic education. Well  as a Cambridge professor  I had many contacts. And to my astonishment  they backed me     percent. They said   Go and do it  and we'll come and lecture.  And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries    where they don't have any opportunities    together with the best lecturers in the world    who I knew would come  because of the interest in Africa    and put them together and just let the sparks fly. So we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town. It's an    room Art Deco hotel from the     s. The area was kind of seedy  so we got an    room hotel for         dollars. It's a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word  we're going to start the best math institute in Africa in this hotel. Well  the new South Africa is a very exciting country. And those of you who haven't been there  you should go. It's very  very interesting what's happening. And we recruited wonderful staff  highly motivated staff. The other thing that's happened  which was good for us  is the Internet. Even though the Internet is very expensive all over Africa  there are Internet cafes everywhere. And bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community  to be successful    and they're very ambitious. They want to be the next Einstein. And so when word came out that AIMS was opening  it spread very quickly via e mail and our website. And we got lots of applicants. Well  we designed AIMS as a    hour learning environment  and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning. You have to rethink  what is the university for  And that's really exciting. So we designed it to have interactive teaching. No droning on at the chalkboard. We emphasize problem solving  working in groups  every student discovering and maximizing their own potential and not chasing grades. Everyone lives together in this hotel    lecturers and students    and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at   a.m. The students don't usually leave the computer lab till   or   a.m. And then they're up again at eight in the morning. Lectures  problem solving and so on. It's an extraordinary place. We especially emphasize areas of great relevance to Africa's development  because  in those areas  scientists working in Africa will have a competitive advantage. They'll publish  be invited to conferences. They'll do well. They'll have successful careers. And AIMS has done extremely well. Here is a list of last year's graduates  graduated in June  and what they're currently doing       of them. And where they are is indicated over here. And where they've gone. So these are all postgraduate students. And they've all gone on to master's and Ph.D. degrees in excellent places. Five students can be educated at AIMS for the cost of educating one in the U.S. or Europe. But more important  the pan African student body is a continual source of strength  pride and commitment to Africa. We illustrate AIMS' progress by coloring in the countries of Africa. So here you can see behind this list. When a county is colored yellow  we've received an application  orange  we've accepted an application  and green  a student has graduated. So here is where we were after the first graduation in     . And we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green. So there's                 . We're well on the way to achieving our initial goal. We had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS. And I'll just show you one. Tendai Mugwagwa  My name is Tendai Mugwagwa. I have a Bachelor of Science with an education degree. I will be attending AIMS. My understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot. You know  from physics to medicine  in particular  epidemiology and also mathematical modeling. Neil Turok  So Tendai came to AIMS and did very well. And I'll let her take it from there. TM  My name is Tendai Mugwagwa and I was a student at AIMS in      and     . After leaving AIMS  I went on to do a master's in applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. After that  I came to the Netherlands where I'm now doing a Ph.D. in theoretical immunology. Professor  Tendai is working very independently. She communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital. So all in all I have a very good Ph.D. student from South Africa. So I'm happy she's here. NT  Another student in the first year of AIMS was Shehu. And he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher. And then entering university in northern Nigeria. And after AIMS  Shehu wanted to do high energy physics  and he came to Cambridge. He's about to finish his Ph.D.  and he was filmed recently with someone you all know. Shehu  And from there we will be able to  hopefully  make better predictions and then we compare it to the graph and also make some predictions. Stephen Hawking  That is nice. NT  Here are the current students at AIMS. There are    of them from    different countries  including    women. So now I'm going to get to my TED business. Well  we had a party. This is Africa    we have good parties in Africa. And last month  they threw a surprise party for me. Here's somebody you've seen already. I want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture. So  we were having a party  as you can see they're completely eclipsing me at this point. This is Ezra. She's from Darfur. She's a physicist  and somehow stays smiling  in spite of everything going on back home. But she wants to continue in physics  and she's doing extremely well. This is Lydia. Lydia is the first ever woman to graduate in mathematics in the Central African Republic. And she's now at AIMS.  Applause  So now let me get to our TED wish. Well  it's not my TED wish  it's our wish  as you've already gathered. And our wish has two parts  one is a dream and the other's a plan. OK. Our TED dream is that the next Einstein will be African.  Applause  In striving for the heights of creative genius  we want to give thousands of people the motivation  the encouragement and the courage to obtain the high level skills they need to help Africa. Among them will be not only brilliant scientists    I'm sure of that from what we've seen at AIMS    they'll also be the African Gates  Brins and Pages of the future. Well  I said we also have a plan. And our plan is quite simple. AIMS is now a proven model. And what we need to do is to replicate it. We want to roll out    AIMS centers in the next five years  all over Africa. Each will have a pan African student body  but specialize in a different area of science. We want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers  as it does at AIMS. And we want to add elements to the curriculum. We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills. The expanded AIMS will be a coherent pan African institution  and its graduates will form a powerful network  working together for peace and progress across the continent. Over the last year  we've been visiting sites in Africa  looking at potential sites for new AIMS centers. And here are the ones we've selected. And each of these centers has a strong local team  each is in a beautiful place  an interesting place  which international lecturers will be happy to visit. And our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this. Everyone wants an AIMS center in their country. And last November  the conference of all the African ministers of science and technology  held in Mombasa  called for a comprehensive plan to roll out AIMS. So we have political support right across the continent. It won't be easy. At every site there will be huge challenges. Local scientists must play leading roles and governments must be persuaded to buy in. Conditions are very difficult  but we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made AIMS work. And we summarize them this way  the institutes have got to be relevant  innovative  cost effective and high quality. Why  Because we want Africa to be rich. Easy to remember the basic rules we need. So  just in ending  let me say the only people who can fix Africa are talented young Africans. By unlocking and nurturing their creative potential  we can create a step change in Africa's future. Over time  they will contribute to African development and to science in ways we can only imagine. Thank you.\n",
      "I experienced my first coup d' tat at the age of four. Because of the coup d' tat  my family had to leave my native home of Ghana and move to the Gambia. As luck would have it  six months after we arrived  they too had a military coup. I vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night and gathering the few belongings we could and walking for about two hours to a safe house. For a week  we slept under our beds because we were worried that bullets might fly through the window. Then  at the age of eight  we moved to Botswana. This time  it was different. There were no coups. Everything worked. Great education. They had such good infrastructure that even at the time they had a fiber optic telephone system  long before it had reached Western countries. The only thing they didn't have is that they didn't have their own national television station  and so I remember watching TV from neighboring South Africa  and watching Nelson Mandela in jail being offered a chance to come out if he would give up the apartheid struggle. But he didn't. He refused to do that until he actually achieved his objective of freeing South Africa from apartheid. And I remember feeling how just one good leader could make such a big difference in Africa. Then at the age of     my family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe. Initially  this too was amazing  growing economy  excellent infrastructure  and it seemed like it was a model for economic development in Africa. I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe and I went off to college. Six years later  I returned to the country. Everything was different. It had shattered into pieces. Millions of people had emigrated  the economy was in a shambles  and it seemed all of a sudden that    years of development had been wiped out. How could a country go so bad so fast  Most people would agree that it's all because of leadership. One man  President Robert Mugabe  is almost single handedly responsible for having destroyed this country. Now  all these experiences of living in different parts of Africa growing up did two things to me. The first is it made me fall in love with Africa. Everywhere I went  I experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent and saw the resilience and the spirit of our people  and at the time  I realized that I wanted to dedicate the rest of my life to making this continent great. But I also realized that making Africa great would require addressing this issue of leadership. You see  all these countries I lived in  the coups d' tat and the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia and in Zimbabwe  contrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen in Botswana and in South  Africa of good leadership. It made me realize that Africa would rise or fall because of the quality of our leaders. Now  one might think  of course  leadership matters everywhere. But if there's one thing you take away from my talk today  it is this  In Africa  more than anywhere else in the world  the difference that just one good leader can make is much greater than anywhere  else  and here's why. It's because in Africa  we have weak institutions  like the judiciary  the constitution  civil society and so forth. So here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in  When societies have strong institutions  the difference that one good leader can make is limited  but when you have weak institutions  then just one good leader can make or break that country. Let me make it a bit more concrete. You become the president of the United States. You think   Wow  I've arrived. I'm the most powerful man in the world.  So you decide  perhaps let me pass a law. All of a sudden  Congress taps you on the shoulder and says   No  no  no  no  no  you can't do that.  You say   Let me try this way.  The Senate comes and says   Uh uh  we don't think you can do that.  You say  perhaps   Let me print some money. I think the economy needs a stimulus.  The central bank governor will think you're crazy. You might get impeached for that. But if you become the president of Zimbabwe  and you say   You know  I really like this job. I think I'd like to stay in it forever.   Laughter  Well  you just can. You decide you want to print money. You call the central bank governor and you say   Please double the money supply.  He'll say   Okay  yes  sir  is there anything else I can do for you   This is the power that African leaders have  and this is why they make the most difference on the continent. The good news is that the quality of leadership in Africa has been improving. We've had three generations  of leaders  in my mind. Generation one are those who appeared in the '  s and '  s. These are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania. The legacy they left is that they brought independence to Africa. They freed us from colonialism  and let's give them credit for that. They were followed by generation two. These are people that brought nothing but havoc to Africa. Think warfare  corruption  human rights abuses. This is the stereotype of  the typical African leader that we typically think of  Mobutu Sese Seko from Zaire  Sani Abacha from Nigeria. The good news is that most of these leaders have moved on  and they were replaced by generation three. These are people like the late Nelson Mandela and most of the leaders that we see in Africa today  like Paul Kagame and so forth. Now these leaders are by no means perfect  but the one thing they have done is that they have cleaned up much of the mess of generation two. They've stopped the fighting  and I call them the stabilizer generation. They're much more accountable to their people  they've improved macroeconomic policies  and we are seeing for the first time Africa's growing  and in  fact it's the second fastest growing economic region in the world. So these leaders are by no means perfect  but they are by and large the best leaders we've seen in the last    years. So where to from here  I believe that the next generation to come after this  generation four  has a unique opportunity to transform the continent. Specifically  they can do two things that previous generations have not done. The first thing they need to do is they need to create prosperity for the continent. Why is prosperity so important  Because none of the previous generations have been able to tackle this issue of poverty. Africa today has the fastest growing population in the world  but also is the poorest. By       Africa will have a larger workforce than China  and by       it will have the largest workforce in the world. One billion people will need jobs in Africa  so if we don't grow our economies fast enough  we're sitting on a ticking time bomb  not just for Africa but for the entire world. Let me show you an example of one person who is living up to this legacy of creating prosperity  Laetitia. Laetitia's a young woman from Kenya who at the age of    had to drop out of school because her family couldn't  afford to pay fees for her. So she started her own business rearing rabbits  which happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya that she's from. This business did so well that within a year  she was employing    women and was able to generate enough income that she was able to send herself to school  and through these women fund another    children to go to school. The profits that she generated  she used that to build a school  and today she educates     children in her community. And she's just turned   . Another example is Erick Rajaonary. Erick comes from the island of Madagascar. Now  Erick realized that agriculture would be the key to creating jobs in the rural areas of Madagascar  but he also realized that fertilizer was a very expensive input for most farmers in Madagascar. Madagascar has these very special bats that produce these droppings that are very high in nutrients. In       Erick quit his job  as a chartered accountant and started a company to manufacture fertilizer from the bat droppings. Today  Erick has built a business that generates several million dollars of revenue  and he employs    people full time and another     people during the season when the bats drop their droppings the most. Now  what I like about this story is that it shows that opportunities  to create prosperity can be found almost anywhere. Erick is known as the Batman. And who would have thought that you would have been able to build a multimillion dollar business employing so many people just from bat poo  The second thing that this generation needs to do is to create our institutions. They need to build these institutions such that we are never held to ransom again by a few individuals like Robert Mugabe. Now  all of this sounds great  but where are we going to get this generation four from  Do we just sit and hope that they emerge by chance  or that God gives them to us  No  I don't think so. It's too important an issue  for us to leave it to chance. I believe that we need to create African institutions  home grown  that will identify and develop these leaders in a systematic  practical way. We've been doing this for the last    years through the African Leadership Academy. Laetitia is one of our young leaders. Today  we have     of them  that are being groomed for the African continent  and over the next    years  we expect to create       of them. But one thing has been troubling me. We would get about       applications a year for     young leaders that we could take into this academy  and so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed for this leadership training that we're offering. But we couldn't satisfy it. So today  I'm announcing for the first time in public an extension to this vision for the African Leadership Academy. We're building    brand new universities in Africa that are going to cultivate this next generation of African leaders. Each campus will have        leaders at a time so we'll be educating and developing         leaders at any given time. Over the next    years  this institution will create three million transformative leaders for the continent. My hope is that half of them will become the entrepreneurs that we need  who will create these jobs that we need  and the other half will go into government and the nonprofit sector  and they will build the institutions that we need. But they won't just learn academics. They will also learn how to become leaders  and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs. So think of this as Africa's Ivy League  but instead of getting admitted because of your SAT scores or because of how much money you have or which family you come from  the main criteria for getting into this university will be what is the potential that you have for transforming Africa  But what we're doing is  just one group of institutions. We cannot transform Africa by ourselves. My hope is that many  many other home grown African institutions will blossom  and these institutions will all come together with a common vision of developing this next generation of African leaders  generation four  and they will teach them this common message  create jobs  build our institutions. Nelson Mandela once said   Every now and then  a generation is called upon to be great. You can be that great generation.  I believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate the next generation of African leaders  then this generation four that is coming up will be the greatest generation that Africa and indeed the entire world has ever seen.

      "Fifty four percent of the world's population lives in our cities. In developing countries  one third of that population is living in slums. Seventy five percent of global energy consumption occurs in our cities  and    percent of gas emissions that cause global warming come from our cities. So things that you and I might think about as global problems  like climate change  the energy crisis or poverty  are really  in many ways  city problems. They will not be solved unless people who live in cities  like most of us  actually start doing a better job  because right now  we are  not doing a very good one. And that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of city life  first  our citizens' willingness to engage with democratic institutions  second  our cities' ability to really include all of their residents  and lastly  our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives. When it comes to engagement  the data is very clear. Voter turnout around the world peaked in the late '  s  and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before  and if those numbers are bad at the national level  at the level of our cities  they are just dismal. In the last two years  two of the world's most consolidated  oldest democracies  the U.S. and France  held nationwide municipal elections. In France  voter turnout hit a record low. Almost    percent of voters decided not to show up. In the U.S.  the numbers were even scarier. In some American cities  voter turnout was close to five percent. I'll let that sink in for a second. We're talking about democratic cities in which    percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders. The city of L.A.  a city of four million people  elected its mayor with just a bit over         votes. That was the lowest turnout the city had seen in     years. Right here  in my city of Rio  in spite of mandatory voting  almost    percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections. When it comes to inclusiveness  our cities are not the best cases of success either  and again  you don't need to look very far in order to find proof of that. The city of Rio is incredibly unequal. This is Leblon. Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood. And this is Complexo do Alem o. This is where over        of the city's poorest residents live. Leblon has an HDI  a Human Development Index  of .   . That is higher than Norway  Switzerland or Sweden. Complexo do Alem o has an HDI of .   . It sits somewhere in between the HDI of Algeria and Gabon. So Rio  like so many cities across the global South  is a place where you can go from northern Europe to sub Saharan Africa in the space of    minutes. If you drive  that is. If you take public transit  it's about two hours. And lastly  perhaps most importantly  cities  with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable  could be the ideal places for human happiness to flourish. We like being around people. We are social animals. Instead  countries where urbanization has already peaked seem to be the very countries in which cities have stopped making us happy. The United States population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the past three decades  and the main reason is this. The American way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many  many American cities  and as a result  they have seen a decline of relations  of the things that make us happy. Many studies show an increase in solitude and a decrease in solidarity  honesty  and social and civic participation. So how do we start building cities that make us care  Cities that value their most important asset  the incredible diversity of the people who live in them  Cities that make us happy  Well  I believe that if we want to change what our cities look like  then we really have to change the decision making processes that have given us the results  that we have right now. We need a participation revolution  and we need it fast. The idea of voting as our  only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore. People are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it's time to delegate that power to someone else. If the protests that swept Brazil in June      have taught us anything  it's that every time we try to exercise our power outside of an electoral context  we are beaten up  humiliated or arrested. And this needs to change  because when it does  not only will people re engage with the structures of representation  but also complement these structures with direct  effective  and  collective decision making  decision making of the kind that attacks inequality by its very inclusive nature  decision making of the kind that can change our cities into better places for us to live. But there is a catch  obviously  Enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare  and there's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role  by making it easier for people to organize  communicate and make decisions without having to be in the same room at the same time. Unfortunately for us  when it comes to fostering democratic processes  our city governments have not used technology to its full potential. So far  most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data on the city  potholes  fallen trees or broken lamps. They have also  to a lesser extent  invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them  just like my mom when I was eight and she told me that I had a choice  I had to be in bed by   p.m.  but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas. That's not participation  and in fact  governments have not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters   the way we allocate our budget  the way we occupy our land  and the way we manage our natural resources. Those are the kinds of decisions that can actually impact global problems that manifest themselves in our cities. The good news is  and I do have good news to share with you  we don't need to wait for governments to do this. I have reason to believe that it's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation. Three years ago  I cofounded an organization called Meu Rio  and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio to organize around causes and places that they care about in their own city  and have an impact on those causes and places every day. In these past three years  Meu Rio grew to a network of         citizens of Rio. About    percent of those  members are young people aged    to   . That is one in every    young people of that age in Rio today. Amongst our members is this adorable little girl  Bia  to your right  and Bia was just    years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition. Her school actually ranks among the best public schools in the country  and it was going to be demolished by the Rio de Janeiro state government to build  I kid you not  a parking lot for the World Cup right before the event happened. Bia started a campaign  and we even watched her school      through webcam monitoring  and many months afterwards  the government changed their minds. Bia's school stayed in place. There's also Jovita. She's an amazing woman whose daughter went missing about    years ago  and since then  she has been looking for her daughter. In that process  she found out that first  she was not alone. In the last year alone              people disappeared in the state of Rio. But she also found out that in spite of that  Rio had no centralized intelligence system for solving missing persons cases. In other Brazilian cities  those systems have helped solve up to    percent of missing persons cases. She started a campaign  and after the secretary of  security got        emails from people asking him to do this  he responded  and started to build a police unit specializing in those cases. It was open to the public at the end of last month  and Jovita was there giving interviews and being very fancy. And then  there is Leandro. Leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in Rio  and he created a recycling project in the slum. At the end of last year  December     he received an eviction order by the Rio de Janeiro state government giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years. The plan was to hand it over to a developer  who planned to turn it into a construction site. Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools  the Pressure Cooker  the same one that Bia and Jovita used  and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve. These stories make me happy  but not just because they have happy endings. They make me happy because they are happy beginnings. The teacher and parent community at Bia's school is looking for other ways they could improve that space even further. Leandro has ambitious plans to take his model to other low income communities in Rio  and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit that she helped created. Bia  Jovita and Leandro are living examples of something that citizens and city  governments around the world need to know  We are ready. As citizens  we are ready to decide on our common destinies  because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone  and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another  and we are ready to do this in cities around the world right now. With the Our Cities network  the Meu Rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities. We have already started doing it in S o Paulo with incredible results  and want to take it to cities around the world through a network of citizen centric  citizen led organizations that can inspire us  challenge us  and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives. It is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking lots  community driven recycling projects or construction sites  loneliness or solidarity  cars or buses  and it is our responsibility to do that now  for ourselves  for our families  for the people who make our lives worth living  and for the incredible creativity  beauty  and wonder that make our cities  in spite of all of their problems  the greatest invention of our time. Obrigado. Thank you.\n",
      "So I'm a city planner  an urban designer  former arts advocate  trained in architecture and art history  and I want to talk to you today not about design but about America and how America can be more economically resilient  how America can be healthier  and how America can be more environmentally sustainable. And I realize this is a global forum  but I think I need to talk about America because there is a history  in some places  not all  of American ideas being appropriated  being emulated  for better or for worse  around the world. And the worst idea we've ever had is suburban sprawl. It's being emulated in many places as we speak. By suburban sprawl  I refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use  and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas belching  time wasting and life threatening prosthetic device that many of us need just to  most Americans  in fact  need  just to live their daily lives. And there's an alternative. You know  we say  half the world is living in cities. Well  in America  that living in cities  for many of them  they're living in cities still where they're dependent on that automobile. And what I work for  and to do  is to make our cities more walkable. But I can't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that I've learned from the economists  the epidemiologists and the environmentalists. So these are the three arguments that I'm going to give you quickly today. When I was growing up in the '  s  the typical American spent one tenth of their income  American family  on transportation. Since then  we've doubled the number of roads in America  and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation. Working families  which are defined as earning between        and        dollars a year in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing  slightly more  because of this phenomenon called  drive till you qualify   finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs  so that they're locked in this  two  three hours  four hours a day of commuting. And these are the neighborhoods  for example  in the Central Valley of California that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up  they were decimated. And in fact  these are many of the half vacant communities that you see today. Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage  it goes underwater  and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you're doing. So we know what it's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars. What happens when a city decides it's going to set other priorities  And probably the best example we have here in America is Portland  Oregon. Portland made a bunch of decisions in the     s that began to distinguish it from almost every other American city. While most other cities were growing an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl  they instituted an urban growth boundary. While most cities were reaming out their roads  removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic  they instituted a skinny streets program. And while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways  they actually invested in bicycling and in walking. And they spent    million dollars on bike facilities  which seems like a lot of money  but it was spent over about    years  so two million dollars a year    not that much    and half the price of the one cloverleaf that they decided to rebuild in that city. These changes and others like them changed the way that Portlanders live  and their vehicle miles traveled per day  the amount that each person drives  actually peaked in       has been dropping ever since  and they now drive    percent less than the rest of the country. The typical Portland citizen drives four miles less  and    minutes less per day than they did before. The economist Joe Cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those    minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region. So if they're not spending that money on driving    and by the way     percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy    if they're not spending that money on driving  what are they spending it on  Well  Portland is reputed to have the most roof racks per capita  the most independent bookstores per capita  the most strip clubs per capita. These are all exaggerations  slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth  which is Portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of America. Actually  Oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states  which may be a good thing or a bad thing  but it makes you glad they're driving less. But actually  they're spending most of it in their homes  and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get. But there's a whole other Portland story  which isn't part of this calculus  which is that young  educated people have been moving to Portland in droves  so that between the last two censuses  they had a    percent increase in college educated millennials  which is five times what you saw anywhere else in the country  or  I should say  of the national average. So on the one hand  a city saves money for its residents by being more walkable and more bikeable  but on the other hand  it also is the cool kind of city that people want to be in these days. So the best economic strategy you can have as a city is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a medical cluster  or an aerospace cluster  but to become a place where people want to be. And millennials  certainly  these engines of entrepreneurship     percent of whom decide first where they want to live  then they move there  then they look for a job  they will come to your city. The health argument is a scary one  and you've probably heard part of this argument before. Again  back in the '  s  a lot's changed since then  back in the '  s  one in    Americans was obese. Now one out of three Americans is obese  and a second third of the population is overweight. Twenty five percent of young men and    percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces. According to the Center for Disease Control  fully one third of all children born after      will get diabetes. We have the first generation of children in America who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents. I believe that this American healthcare crisis that we've all heard about is an urban design crisis  and that the design of our cities lies at the cure. Because we've talked a long time about diet  and we know that diet impacts weight  and weight of course impacts health. But we've only started talking about inactivity  and how inactivity born of our landscape  inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk  is driving our weight up. And we finally have the studies  one in Britain called  Gluttony versus sloth  that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity  and found a much higher  stronger correlation between the latter two. Dr. James Levine at  in this case  the aptly named Mayo Clinic put his test subjects in electronic underwear  held their diet steady  and then started pumping the calories in. Some people gained weight  some people didn't gain weight. Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work  they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving  and that in fact those who gained weight were sitting  on average  two hours more per day than those who didn't. So we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity  but even more  we now have studies that tie weight to where you live. Do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city  or where in your city do you live  In San Diego  they used Walk Score    Walk Score rates every address in America and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is    they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods and less walkable neighborhoods. Well guess what  If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. So we have study after study now that's tying where you live to your health  particularly as in America  the biggest health crisis we have is this one that's stemming from environmental induced inactivity. And I learned a new word last week. They call these neighborhoods  obesageneric.  I may have that wrong  but you get the idea. Now that's one thing  of course. Briefly mentioning  we have an asthma epidemic in this country. You probably haven't thought that much about it. Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma  three times what it was in the '  s  and it's almost all coming from car exhaust. American pollution does not come from factories anymore  it comes from tailpipes  and the amount that people are driving in your city  your urban VMT  is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city. And then finally  in terms of driving  there's the issue of the single largest killer of healthy adults  and one of the largest killers of all people  is car crashes. And we take car crashes for granted. We figure it's a natural risk of being on the road. But in fact  here in America     people out of every         die every year from car crashes. We're pretty safe here. Well  guess what  In England  it's seven per        . It's Japan  it's four per        . Do you know where it's three per          New York City. San Francisco  the same thing. Portland  the same thing. Oh  so cities make us safer because we're driving less  Tulsa     per        . Orlando     per        . It's not whether you're in the city or not  it's how is your city designed  Was it designed around cars or around people  Because if your city is designed around cars  it's really good at smashing them into each other. That's part of a much larger health argument. Finally  the environmental argument is fascinating  because the environmentalists turned on a dime about    years ago. The environmental movement in America has historically been an anti city movement from Jefferson on.  Cities are pestilential to the health  to the liberties  to the morals of man. If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities  as they do in Europe  we shall become as corrupt as they are in Europe and take to eating one another as they do there.  He apparently had a sense of humor. And then the American environmental movement has been a classically Arcadian movement. To become more environmental  we move into the country  we commune with nature  we build suburbs. But  of course  we've seen what that does. The carbon mapping of America  where is the CO  being emitted  for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly. If you look at any carbon map  because we map it per square mile  any carbon map of the U.S.  it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.  hottest in the cities  cooler in the suburbs  dark  peaceful in the countryside. Until some economists said  you know  is that the right way to measure CO   There are only so many people in this country at any given time  and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact. And they said  let's measure CO  per household  and when they did that  the maps just flipped  coolest in the center city  warmer in the suburbs  and red hot in these exurban  drive till you qualify  neighborhoods. So a fundamental shift  and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species. If you love nature  the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it  move to a city  and the denser the better  and the denser cities like Manhattan are the cities that perform the best. So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '  s  consuming half of the electricity of Dallas. But of course  we can do better. Canadian cities  they consume half the gasoline of American cities. European cities consume half as much again. So obviously  we can do better  and we want to do better  and we're all trying to be green. My final argument in this topic is that I think we're trying to be green the wrong way  and I'm one of many people who believes that this focus on gadgets  on accessorizing    What can I add to my house  what can I add to what I've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable     has kind of dominated the discussion. So I'm not immune to this. My wife and I built a new house on an abandoned lot in Washington  D.C.  and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store. We've got the solar photovoltaic system  solar hot water heater  dual flush toilets  bamboo floors. A log burning in my German high tech stove apparently  supposedly  contributes less carbon to the atmosphere than were it left alone to decompose in the forest. Yet all of these innovations    That's what they said in the brochure. All of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city. We've changed all our light bulbs to energy savers  and you should do the same thing  but changing all your light bulbs to energy savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week. And we don't want to have this argument. Politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a  lifestyle choice.  You don't want to tell Americans  God forbid  that they have to change their lifestyle. But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more  something that would be better than what we have right now  Well  the gold standard of quality of life rankings  it's called the Mercer Survey. You may have heard of it. They rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to    criteria that they believe add up to quality of life  health  economics  education  housing  you name it. There's six more. Short talk. And it's very interesting to see that the highest ranking American city  Honolulu  number     is followed by kind of the usual suspects of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. The driving cities in the Sun Belt  the Dallases and the Phoenixes and  sorry  Atlanta  these cities are not appearing on the list. But who's doing even better  The Canadian cities like Vancouver  where again  they're burning half the fuel. And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German  like Dusseldorf or Vienna  where they're burning  again  half as much fuel. And you see this alignment  this strange alignment. Is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life  I would argue the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life  and that's living in a walkable neighborhood. So sustainability  which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability. But particularly here in America  we are polluting so much because we're throwing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway  then these two problems would seem to share the same solution  which is to make our cities more walkable. Doing so isn't easy  but it can be done  it has been done  and it's being done now in more than a few cities  around the globe and in our country. I take some solace from Winston Churchill  who put it this way   The Americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives.   Laughter  Thank you.\n",
      "I hope you'll understand my English. In the mornings it is terrible  and the afternoon is worst. During many years  I made some speeches starting with this saying   City is not a problem  it's a solution.  And more and more  I'm convinced that it's not only a solution for a country  but it's a solution for the problem of climate change. But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities. I'm working in cities for almost    years  and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big  or the other mayors say   We don't have financial resources   I would like to say from the experience I had  every city in the world can be improved in less than three years. There's no matter of scale. It's not a question of scale  it's not a question of financial resources. Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co responsibility and also a design. So to start  I want to introduce some characters from a book I made for teenagers. The best example of quality of life is the turtle because the turtle is an example of living and working together. And when you realize that the casque of the turtle looks like an urban tessitura  and can we imagine  if we cut the casque of the turtle  how sad she's going to be  And that's what we're doing in our cities  living here  working here  having leisure here. And most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city. So  the other character is Otto  the automobile. He is invited for a party    he never wants to leave. The chairs are on the tables and still drinking  and he drinks a lot.  Laughter  And he coughs a lot. Very egotistical  he carries only one or two people and he asks always for more infrastructure. Freeways. He's a very demanding person. And on the other hand  Accordion  the friendly bus  he carries     people        in Sweden      Brazilians.  Laughter  Speaking about the design  every city has its own design. Curitiba  my city  three million in the metropolitan area            people in the city itself. Curitiba  Rio  it's like two birds kissing themselves. Oaxaca  San Francisco    it's very easy  Market Street  Van Ness and the waterfront. And every city has its own design. But to make it happen  sometimes you have to propose a scenario and to propose a design    an idea that everyone  or the large majority  will help you to make it happen. And that's the structure of the city of Curitiba. And it's an example of living and working together. And this is where we have more density  it's where we have more public transport. So  this system started in '  . We started with        passengers a day  now it's           passengers a day. And it took    years until another city ... which is Bogota  and they did a very good job. And now there's    cities all over the world that they are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba. And one thing  it's important not for only your own city  every city  besides its normal problems  they have a very important role in being with the whole humanity. That means mostly two main issues    mobility and sustainability    are becoming very important for the cities. And this is an articulated bus  double articulated. And we are very close to my house. You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there. And that's the evolution of the system. What in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes  the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway. That's why  I'm trying to say  it's like metro nizing the bus. This is the design of the bus  and you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding. And for handicapped  they can use this as a normal system. What I'm trying to say is the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars    more than    percent    so when we depend only on cars  it's ...    that's why when we're talking about sustainability  it's not enough  green buildings. It's not enough  a new materials. It's not enough  new sources of energy. It's the concept of the city  the design of the city  that's also important  too. And also  how to teach the children. I'll speak on this later on. Our idea of mobility is trying to make the connections between all the systems. We started in '    proposing for the city of Rio how to connect the subway with the bus. The subway was against  of course. And    years after  they called us to develop    we're developing this idea. And you can understand how different it's going to be  the image of Rio with the system    one minute frequency. And it's not Shanghai  it's not being colored during the day  only at night it will look this way. And before you say it's a Norman Foster design  we designed this in '  . And this is the model  how it's going to work. So  it's the same system  the vehicle is different. And that's the model. What I'm trying to say is  I'm not trying to prove which system of transport is better. I'm trying to say we have to combine all the systems  and with one condition  never    if you have a subway  if you have surface systems  if you have any kind of system    never compete in the same space. And coming back to the car  I always used to say that the car is like your mother in law  you have to have good relationship with her  but she cannot command your life. So  when the only woman in your life is your mother in law  you have a problem.  Laughter  So  all the ideas about how to transform through design    old quarries and open universities and botanic garden    all of it's related to how we teach the children. And the children  we teach during six months how to separate their garbage. And after  the children teach their parents. And now we have    percent    since    years  it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world. Seven zero. So teach the children. I would like to say  if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what's said  but don't forget the cities and the children. I'm working in a museum and also a multi use city  because you cannot have empty places during    hours a day. You should have always a structure of living and working together. Try to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the    hours. Another issue is  a city's like our family portrait. We don't rip our family portrait  even if we don't like the nose of our uncle  because this portrait is you. And these are the references that we have in any city. This is the main pedestrian mall  we did it in    hours. Yes  you have to be fast. And these are the references from our ethnic contribution. This is the Italian portal  the Ukrainian park  the Polish park  the Japanese square  the German park. All of a sudden  the Soviet Union  they split. And since we have people from Uzbekistan  Kazakhstan  Tajikistan   unclear   we have to stop the program. Don't forget  creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget. If you cut two zeros  it's much better. And this is the Wire Opera theater. We did it in two months. Parks    old quarries that they were transformed into parks. Quarries once made the nature  and sometimes we took this and we transformed. And every part can be transformed  every frog can be transformed in a prince. So  in a city  you have to work fast. Planning takes time. And I'm proposing urban acupuncture. That means me  with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning. And this is an acupuncture note    or I.M. Pei's. Some small ones can make the city better. The smallest park in New York  the most beautiful     meters. So  I want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials    new sustainable materials    but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end  because we don't have the whole time to plan. And I think creativity  innovation is starting. And we cannot have all the answers. So when you start    and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers    it's important starting and having the contribution from people  and they could teach you if you're not in the right track. At the end  I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song. OK  Please  allow me just two minutes. You're going to make the music and the rhythm.   Toonchi too  Toonchi too  Toonchi too      Toonchi too  Toonchi too  Toonchi too      It's possible  It's possible  You can do it  You can do it      Use less your car  Make this decision      Avoid carbon emission  It's possible  It's possible      You can do it  You can do it      Live closer to work      Work closer to home  Save energy in your home      It's possible  It's possible  You can do it      You can do it  Separate your garbage      Organic  schmorganic  Save more  Waste less  It's possible      You can do it  Please  do it now    Thank you.\n",
      "How many of you have been to Oklahoma City  Raise your hand. Yeah  How many of you have not been to Oklahoma City and have no idea who I am   Laughter  Most of you. Let me give you a little bit of background. Oklahoma City started in the most unique way imaginable. Back on a spring day in       the federal government held what they called a land run. They literally lined up the settlers along an imaginary line  and they fired off a gun  and the settlers roared across the countryside and put down a stake  and wherever they put down that stake  that was their new home. And at the end of the very first day  the population of Oklahoma City had gone from zero to         and our planning department is still paying for that. The citizens got together on that first day and elected a mayor. And then they shot him. That's not really all that funny     Laughter     but it allows me to see what type of audience I'm dealing with  so I appreciate the feedback. The   th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City. Our economy was based on commodities  so the price of cotton or the price of wheat  and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas. And along the way  we became a city of innovation. The shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City. The parking meter  invented in Oklahoma City. You're welcome. Having an economy  though  that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs  and that was certainly the case in Oklahoma City's history. In the     s  when it appeared that the price of energy would never retreat  our economy was soaring  and then in the early     s  it cratered quickly. The price of energy dropped. Our banks began to fail. Before the end of the decade      banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma. There was no bailout on the horizon. Our banking industry  our oil and gas industry  our commercial real estate industry  were all at the bottom of the economic scale. Young people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves for Washington and Dallas and Houston and New York and Tokyo  anywhere where they could  find a job that measured up to their educational attainment  because in Oklahoma City  the good jobs just weren't there. But along at the end of the '  s came an enterprising businessman who became mayor named Ron Norick. Ron Norick eventually figured out that the secret to economic development wasn't incentivizing companies up front  it was about creating a place where businesses wanted to locate  and so he pushed an initiative called MAPS that basically was a penny on the dollar sales tax to build a bunch of stuff. It built a new sports arena  a new canal downtown  it fixed up our performing arts center  a new baseball stadium downtown  a lot of things to improve the quality of life. And the economy indeed seemed to start showing some signs of life. The next mayor came along. He started MAPS for Kids  rebuilt the entire inner city school system  all    buildings either built anew or refurbished. And then  in       in this rare collective lack of judgment bordering on civil disobedience  the citizens elected me mayor. Now the city I inherited was just on the verge of coming out of its slumbering economy  and for the very first time  we started showing up on the lists. Now you know the lists I'm talking about. The media and the Internet love to rank cities. And in Oklahoma City  we'd never really been on lists before. So I thought it was kind of cool when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there. We weren't anywhere close to the top  but we were on the list  we were somebody. Best city to get a job  best city to start a business  best downtown    Oklahoma City. And then came the list of the most obese cities in the country. And there we were. Now I like to point out that we were on that list with a lot of really cool places. Dallas and Houston and New Orleans and Atlanta and Miami. You know  these are cities that  typically  you're not embarrassed to be associated with. But nonetheless  I didn't like being on the list. And about that time  I got on the scales. And I weighed     pounds. And then I went to this website sponsored by the federal government  and I typed in my height  I typed in my weight  and I pushed Enter  and it came back and said  obese.  I thought   What a stupid website.   I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese.  And then I started getting honest with myself about what had become my lifelong struggle with obesity  and I noticed this pattern  that I was gaining about two or three pounds a year  and then about every    years  I'd drop    or    pounds. And then I'd do it again. And I had this huge closet full of clothes  and I could only wear a third of it at any one time  and only I knew which part of the closet I could wear. But it all seemed fairly normal  going through it. Well  I finally decided I needed to lose weight  and I knew I could because I'd done it so many times before  so I simply stopped eating as much. I had always exercised. That really wasn't the part of the equation that I needed to work on. But I had been eating       calories a day  and I cut it to       calories a day  and the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week for about    weeks. Along the way  though  I started examining my city  its culture  its infrastructure  trying to figure out why our specific city seemed to have a problem with obesity. And I came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car. But if you happen to be a person  you are combatting the car seemingly at every turn. Our city is very spread out. We have a great intersection of highways  I mean  literally no traffic congestion in Oklahoma City to speak of. And so people live far  far away. Our city limits are enormous      square miles  but    miles is less than    minutes. You literally can get a speeding ticket during rush hour in Oklahoma City. And as a result  people tend to spread out. Land's cheap. We had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments  for a long  long time. We had fixed that  but it had been relatively recently  and there were literally         or more homes into our inventory in neighborhoods that had  virtually no level of walkability. And as I tried to examine how we might deal with obesity  and was taking all of these elements into my mind  I decided that the first thing we need to do was have a conversation. You see  in Oklahoma City  we weren't talking about obesity. And so  on New Year's Eve of       I went to the zoo  and I stood in front of the elephants  and I said   This city is going on a diet  and we're going to lose a million pounds.  Well  that's when all hell broke loose. The national media gravitated toward this story immediately  and they really could have  gone with it one of two ways. They could have said   This city is so fat that the mayor had to put them on a diet.  But fortunately  the consensus was   Look  this is a problem in a lot of places. This is a city that's wanting to do something about it.  And so they started helping us drive traffic to the website. Now  the web address was thiscityisgoingonadiet.com. And I appeared on  The Ellen DeGeneres Show  one weekday morning to talk about the initiative  and on that day          visits were placed to our website. People were signing up  and so the pounds started to add up  and the conversation that I thought was so important to have was starting to take place. It was taking place inside the homes  mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids. It was taking place in churches. Churches were starting their own running groups and their own support groups for people who were dealing with obesity. Suddenly  it was a topic worth discussing at schools and in the workplace. And the large companies  they typically have wonderful wellness programs  but the medium sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this  they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others. And then came the next stage of the equation. It was time to push what I called MAPS  . Now MAPS    like the other two programs  had had an economic development motive behind it  but along with the traditional economic development tasks like building a new convention center  we added some health related infrastructure to the process. We added a new central park     acres in size  to be right downtown in Oklahoma City. We're building a downtown streetcar to try and help the walkability formula for people who choose to live in the inner city and help us create the density there. We're building senior health and wellness centers throughout the community. We put some investments on the river that had originally been invested upon in the original MAPS  and now we are currently in the final stages of developing the finest venue in the world for the sports of canoe  kayak and rowing. We hosted the Olympic trials last spring. We have Olympic caliber events coming to Oklahoma City  and athletes from all over the world moving in  along with inner city programs to get kids more engaged in these types of recreational activities that are a little bit nontraditional. We also  with another initiative that was passed  are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks throughout the metro area. We're even going back into some inner city situations where we had built neighborhoods and we had built schools but we had not connected the two. We had built libraries and we had built neighborhoods  but we had never really connected the two with any sort of walkability. Through yet another funding source  we're redesigning all of our inner city streets to be more pedestrian friendly. Our streets were really wide  and you'd push the button to allow you to walk across  and you had to run in order to get there in time. But now we've narrowed the streets  highly landscaped them  making them more pedestrian friendly  really a redesign  rethinking the way we build our infrastructure  designing a city around people and not cars. We're completing our bicycle trail master plan. We'll have over     miles when we're through building it out. And so you see this culture starting to shift in Oklahoma City. And lo and behold  the demographic changes that are coming with it are very inspiring. Highly educated twentysomethings are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region and  indeed  even from further away  in California. When we reached a million pounds  in January of       I flew to New York with some our participants who had lost over     pounds  whose lives had been changed  and we appeared on the Rachael Ray show  and then that afternoon  I did a round of media in New York pushing the same messages that you're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it. And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine  the same magazine that had put us on that list five years before. And as I'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter  I notice there's a magazine copy of the current issue right there on the table  and I pick it up  and I look at the headline across the top  and it says   America's Fattest Cities  Do You Live in One   Well  I knew I did  so I picked up the magazine and I began to look  and we weren't on it. Then I looked on the list of fittest cities  and we were on that list. We were on the list as the   nd fittest city in the United States. Our state health statistics are doing better. Granted  we have a long way to go. Health is still not something that we should be proud of in Oklahoma City  but we seem to have turned the cultural shift of making health a greater priority. And we love the idea of the demographics of highly educated twentysomethings  people with choices  choosing Oklahoma City in large numbers. We have the lowest unemployment in the United States  probably the strongest economy in the United States. And if you're like me  at some point in your educational career  you were asked to read a book called  The Grapes of Wrath.  Oklahomans leaving for California in large numbers for a better future. When we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west  it appears that what we're seeing now is the wrath of grapes. The grandchildren are coming home. You've been a great audience and very attentive. Thank you very much for having me here.\n",
      "When people think about cities  they tend to think of certain things. They think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers  noisy cabs. But when I think about cities  I think about people. Cities are fundamentally about people  and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work. So even more important than buildings in a city are the public spaces in between them. And today  some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces. So I believe that lively  enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city. They are what makes it come alive. But what makes a public space work  What attracts people to successful public spaces  and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away  I thought  if I could answer those questions  I could make a huge contribution to my city. But one of the more wonky things about me is that I am an animal behaviorist  and I use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces. One of the first spaces that I studied was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park in midtown Manhattan. This little space became a small phenomenon  and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers  it made an enormous impression on me. I studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather  so I knew that places like Paley Park didn't happen by accident. I saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail. But what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it  Well  I would sit in the park and watch very carefully  and first among other things were the comfortable  movable chairs. People would come in  find their own seat  move it a bit  actually  and then stay a while  and then interestingly  people themselves attracted other people  and ironically  I felt more peaceful if there were other people around. And it was green. This little park provided what New Yorkers crave  comfort and greenery. But my question was  why weren't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn't feel alone  or like a trespasser  Unfortunately  that's not how cities were being designed. So here you see a familiar sight. This is how plazas have been designed for generations. They have that stylish  Spartan look that we often associate with modern architecture  but it's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this. They not only look desolate  they feel downright dangerous. I mean  where would you sit here  What would you do here  But architects love them. They are plinths for their creations. They might tolerate a sculpture or two  but that's about it. And for developers  they are ideal. There's nothing to water  nothing to maintain  and no undesirable people to worry about. But don't you think this is a waste  For me  becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that I lived in and loved. I wanted to be able to create places that would give you the feeling that you got in Paley Park  and not allow developers to build bleak plazas like this. But over the many years  I have learned how hard it is to create successful  meaningful  enjoyable public spaces. As I learned from my stepfather  they certainly do not happen by accident  especially in a city like New York  where public space has to be fought for to begin with  and then for them to be successful  somebody has to think very hard about every detail. Now  open spaces in cities are opportunities. Yes  they are opportunities for commercial investment  but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city  and those two goals are often not aligned with one another  and therein lies the conflict. The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early     s  when I was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River. And this sandy wasteland had lain barren for    years  and we were told  unless we found a developer in six months  it would go bankrupt. So we came up with a radical  almost insane idea. Instead of building a park as a complement to future development  why don't we reverse that equation and build a small but very high quality public open space first  and see if that made a difference. So we only could afford to build a two block section of what would become a mile long esplanade  so whatever we built had to be perfect. So just to make sure  I insisted that we build a mock up in wood  at scale  of the railing and the sea wall. And when I sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me  the railing hit exactly at eye level  blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water's edge. So you see  details really do make a difference. But design is not just how something looks  it's how your body feels on that seat in that space  and I believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience. In this photo  everything looks very finished  but that granite edge  those lights  the back on that bench  the trees in planting  and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be. Now  this proved very valuable    years later when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of New York. And he said to me on that very day  he said that New York was projected to grow from eight to nine million people. And he asked me   So where are you going to put one million additional New Yorkers   Well  I didn't have any idea. Now  you know that New York does place a high value on attracting immigrants  so we were excited about the prospect of growth  but honestly  where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water  How were we going to find housing for that many new New Yorkers  And if we couldn't spread out  which was probably a good thing  where could new housing go  And what about cars  Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars. So what were we going to do  If we couldn't spread out  we had to go up. And if we had to go up  we had to go up in places where you wouldn't need to own a car. So that meant using one of our greatest assets  our transit system. But we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it. So here was the answer to our puzzle. If we were to channel and redirect all new development around transit  we could actually handle that population increase  we thought. And so here was the plan  what we really needed to do  We needed to redo our zoning    and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool    and basically reshape the entire city  targeting where new development could go and prohibiting any development at all in our car oriented  suburban style neighborhoods. Well  this was an unbelievably ambitious idea  ambitious because communities had to approve those plans. So how was I going to get this done  By listening. So I began listening  in fact  thousands of hours of listening just to establish trust. You know  communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods. It's not something you can just fake. And so I began walking. I can't tell you how many blocks I walked  in sweltering summers  in freezing winters  year after year  just so I could get to understand the DNA of each neighborhood and know what each street felt like. I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert  finding ways that zoning could address communities' concerns. So little by little  neighborhood by neighborhood  block by block  we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit. Over the course of    years  we were able to rezone     neighborhoods     percent of the city         blocks  so that now     percent of all new development of New York is within a    minute walk of a subway. In other words  nobody in those new buildings needs to own a car. Well  those rezonings were exhausting and enervating and important  but rezoning was never my mission. You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning. My mission was always to create great public spaces. So in the areas where we zoned for significant development  I was determined to create places that would make a difference in people's lives. Here you see what was two miles of abandoned  degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn  impossible to get to and impossible to use. Now the zoning here was massive  so I felt an obligation to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts  and I spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans. I wanted to make sure that there were tree lined paths from the upland to the water  that there were trees and plantings everywhere  and  of course  lots and lots of places to sit. Honestly  I had no idea how it would turn out. I had to have faith. But I put everything that I had studied and learned into those plans. And then it opened  and I have to tell you  it was incredible. People came from all over the city to be in these parks. I know they changed the lives of the people who live there  but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image of their city. I often come down and watch people get on this little ferry that now runs between the boroughs  and I can't tell you why  but I'm completely moved by the fact that people are using it as if it had always been there. And here is a new park in lower Manhattan. Now  the water's edge in lower Manhattan was a complete mess before     . Wall Street was essentially landlocked because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge. And after       the city had very little control. But I thought if we went to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan. And it did. Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides. I really love this park. You know  railings have to be higher now  so we put bar seating at the edge  and you can get so close to the water you're practically on it. And see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop. And I love when people come there and look up and they say   Wow  there's Brooklyn  and it's so close.  So what's the trick  How do you turn a park into a place that people want to be  Well  it's up to you  not as a city planner but as a human being. You don't tap into your design expertise. You tap into your humanity. I mean  would you want to go there  Would you want to stay there  Can you see into it and out of it  Are there other people there  Does it seem green and friendly  Can you find your very own seat  Well now  all over New York City  there are places where you can find your very own seat. Where there used to be parking spaces  there are now pop up cafes. Where Broadway traffic used to run  there are now tables and chairs. Where    years ago  sidewalk cafes were not allowed  they are now everywhere. But claiming these spaces for public use was not simple  and it's even harder to keep them that way. So now I'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park called the High Line. The High Line was an elevated railway. The High Line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on Manhattan's West Side  and when the train stopped running  it became a self seeded landscape  a kind of a garden in the sky. And when I saw it the first time  honestly  when I went up on that old viaduct  I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person  honestly. And when I was appointed  saving the first two sections of the High Line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project. I knew if there was a day that I didn't worry about the High Line  it would come down. And the High Line  even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular  it is the most contested public space in the city. You might see a beautiful park  but not everyone does. You know  it's true  commercial interests will always battle against public space. You might say   How wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the High Line.  Well  a developer sees just one thing  customers. Hey  why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the High Line  Wouldn't that be terrific and won't it mean a lot more money for the city  Well no  it would not be terrific. It would be a mall  and not a park. And you know what  it might mean more money for the city  but a city has to take the long view  the view for the common good. Most recently  the last section of the High Line  the third section of the High Line  the final section of the High Line  has been pitted against development interests  where some of the city's leading developers are building more than    million square feet at the Hudson Yards. And they came to me and proposed that they  temporarily disassemble  that third and final section. Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a hill. Perhaps it was just in their way. But in any case  it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition  and that was only two years ago. So you see  no matter how popular and successful a public space may be  it can never be taken for granted. Public spaces always    this is it saved    public spaces always need vigilant champions  not only to claim them at the outset for public use  but to design them for the people that use them  then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone  that they are not violated  invaded  abandoned or ignored. If there is any one lesson that I have learned in my life as a city planner  it is that public spaces have power. It's not just the number of people using them  it's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there. Public space can change how you live in a city  how you feel about a city  whether you choose one city over another  and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city. I believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party. People stay because they are having a great time. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause \n",

      "ocean sea coral oceans animals shark sharks corals marine whales\n",
      "Fifty years ago  when I began exploring the ocean  no one    not Jacques Perrin  not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson    imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed  at that time  to be a sea of Eden  but now we know  and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us  and to consider why it matters that in    years  we've lost    actually  we've taken  we've eaten    more than    percent of the big fish in the sea  why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared  why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying  but it really should concern you. It does concern you  as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls  tomorrow's child   asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well  now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and  in so doing  secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope  Jill  that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. Did I say that  I guess I did. For me  as a scientist  it all began in      when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night  you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in       when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time    at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In      I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and       feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then  I've used about    kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five year National Geographic expedition  the Sustainable Seas expeditions  using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air  food  water  temperature    all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system  and then he pointed to this and he said   Life support system.  We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said   Thousands have lived without love  none without water.  Ninety seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue  no green. If you think the ocean isn't important  imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean  no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said   There it is  The World Bank   That's where all the assets are  And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink  every breath you take  you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time  most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there  mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather  stabilizes temperature  shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain  sleet and snow  and provides home for about    percent of life in the world  maybe in the universe. No water  no life  no blue  no green. Yet we have this idea  we humans  that the Earth    all of it  the oceans  the skies    are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true        years ago  and maybe even       years ago but in the last      especially in the last     we've drawn down the assets  the air  the water  the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature  the nature of what's happening  showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean  first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately  in our time  we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring  there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago  I met John Hanke  who's the head of Google Earth  and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him   When are you going to finish it  You did a great job with the land  the dirt. What about the water   Since then  I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers  with DOER Marine  with National Geographic  with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world  ones that we could enlist  to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week  last Monday  Google Earth is now whole. Consider this  Starting right here at the convention center  we can find the nearby aquarium  we can look at where we're sitting  and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium  the ocean  and California's four national marine sanctuaries  and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands  not just the little bit that pokes through the surface  but also what's below. To see    wait a minute  we can go kshhplash     right there  ha    under the ocean  see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place  seven miles down  the Mariana Trench  where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles  but only two people have been there     years ago. One way trips are easy. We need new deep diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration  We need to see deep trenches  the undersea mountains  and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming  it's also changing ocean chemistry  making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets  gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean  poisoning the planet's circulatory system  and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife  all carbon based units. Barbarically  we're killing sharks for shark fin soup  undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle  the nitrogen cycle  the oxygen cycle  the water cycle    our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna  truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines  with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for    miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers  taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers    in China  the North Sea  the Gulf of Mexico    shaking the foundation of our life support system  leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi    or sashimi  or swordfish steak  or shrimp cocktail  whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean    think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market  more than    pounds  even     pounds  may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from      to     . The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime  imagine     percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles  sharks  tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But  there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape  a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time  but not a lot  to turn things around. But business as usual means that in    years  there may be no coral reefs    and no commercial fishing  because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too  but the problems are more obvious  and some actions are being taken to protect trees  watersheds and wildlife. And in       with Yellowstone National Park  the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had. About    percent of the land around the world is now protected  safeguarding biodiversity  providing a carbon sink  generating oxygen  protecting watersheds. And  in       this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea  National Marine Sanctuaries. That's another great idea. The good news is that there are now more than       places in the sea  around the world  that have some kind of protection. And you can find them on Google Earth. The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. In the last three years  for example  the U.S. protected         square miles of ocean as national monuments. But it only increased from  .  of one percent to  .  of one percent of the ocean protected  globally. Protected areas do rebound  but it takes a long time to restore    year old rockfish or monkfish  sharks or sea bass  or     year old orange roughy. We don't consume     year old cows or chickens. Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life  or the census of marine life  will live not just as a list  a photograph  or a paragraph. With scientists around the world  I've been looking at the    percent of the ocean that is open to fishing    and mining  and drilling  and dumping  and whatever    to search out hope spots  and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic    we have one chance  right now  to get it right. Or the Antarctic  where the continent is protected  but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill  whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows.    percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected  but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf  which is now in serious trouble. The high seas  where whales  tuna and dolphins travel    the largest  least protected  ecosystem on Earth  filled with luminous creatures  living in dark waters that average two miles deep. They flash  and sparkle  and glow with their own living light. There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child. The next    years may be the most important  and the next        years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. To cope with climate change  we need new ways to generate power. We need new ways  better ways  to cope with poverty  wars and disease. We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place. But  nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean. Our fate and the ocean's are one. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. A global plan of action with a world conservation union  the IUCN  is underway to protect biodiversity  to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change  on the high seas and in coastal areas  wherever we can identify critical places. New technologies are needed to map  photograph and explore the    percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. The goal is to protect biodiversity  to provide stability and resilience. We need deep diving subs  new technologies to explore the ocean. We need  maybe  an expedition    a TED at sea    that could help figure out the next steps. And so  I suppose you want to know what my wish is. I wish you would use all means at your disposal    films  expeditions  the web  new submarines    and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas    hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean  the blue heart of the planet. How much  Some say    percent  some say    percent. You decide  how much of your heart do you want to protect  Whatever it is  a fraction of one percent is not enough. My wish is a big wish  but if we can make it happen  it can truly change the world  and help ensure the survival of what actually    as it turns out    is my favorite species  that would be us. For the children of today  for tomorrow's child  as never again  now is the time. Thank you.\n",
      "The oceans cover some    percent of our planet. And I think Arthur C. Clarke probably had it right when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet Planet Ocean. And the oceans are hugely productive  as you can see by the satellite image of photosynthesis  the production of new life. In fact  the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe. In addition to that  it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth  and much of it we don't know about. But I'll tell you some of that today. That also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction that we do from the ocean. That's about    percent of our global needs and     percent of some island nations. If you were to descend into the    percent of the biosphere that's livable  it would quickly become pitch black  interrupted only by pinpoints of light from bioluminescent organisms. And if you turn the lights on  you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by  because those are the denizens of the deep  the things that live in the deep ocean. And eventually  the deep sea floor would come into view. This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface than all other habitats combined. And yet  we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars than we do about this habitat  despite the fact that we have yet to extract a gram of food  a breath of oxygen or a drop of water from those bodies. And so    years ago  an international program began called the Census of Marine Life  which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans. It involved    different projects around the world. As you can see  these are the footprints of the different projects. And I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage that it managed to achieve. It all began when two scientists  Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel  met in Woods Hole  Massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute. And Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it. Well  from that discussion grew this program that involved       scientists from more than    countries around the world who engaged in     ocean expeditions at a combined cost of     million dollars to study the distribution  diversity and abundance of life in the global ocean. And so what did we find  We found spectacular new species  the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked    from the shoreline to the abyss  form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between. And the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life  but rather the taxonomic specialists who can identify and catalog these species that became the limiting step. They  in fact  are an endangered species themselves. There are actually four to five new species described everyday for the oceans. And as I say  it could be a much larger number. Now  I come from Newfoundland in Canada    It's an island off the east coast of that continent    where we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters in human history. And so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish. It's around     . Now  when I was a boy of about his age  I would go out fishing with my grandfather and we would catch fish about half that size. And I thought that was the norm  because I had never seen fish like this. If you were to go out there today     years after this fishery collapsed  if you could catch a fish  which would be a bit of a challenge  it would be half that size still. So what we're experiencing is something called shifting baselines. Our expectations of what the oceans can produce is something that we don't really appreciate because we haven't seen it in our lifetimes. Now most of us  and I would say me included  think that human exploitation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last    to  perhaps      years or so. The census actually tried to look back in time  using every source of information they could get their hands on. And so anything from restaurant menus to monastery records to ships' logs to see what the oceans looked like. Because science data really goes back to  at best  World War II  for the most part. And so what they found  in fact  is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans. And so at that time  of course  there was no refrigeration. So fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day. But the Romans developed salting. And with salting  it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances. And so began industrial fishing. And so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have of what sort of loss we've had relative to pre human impacts on the ocean. They range from    to    percent for these major groups of organisms  as shown in the dark blue bars. Now for those species the we managed to leave alone  that we protect    for example  marine mammals in recent years and sea birds    there is some recovery. So it's not all hopeless. But for the most part  we've gone from salting to exhausting. Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one. It's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida. And so this is a photograph from the     s. I want you to notice the scale on the slide  because when you see the same picture from the     s  we see the fish are much smaller and we're also seeing a change in terms of the composition of those fish. By       the catch was actually laughable in terms of the size for a trophy fish. But this is no laughing matter. The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity and we're responsible for it. So what's left  Actually quite a lot. There's a lot of exciting things  and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them. And I want to start with a bit on technology  because  of course  this is a TED Conference and you want to hear something on technology. So one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean are remotely operated vehicles. So these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor where they're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom. So a couple of years ago  I was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise and I couldn't go because of a scheduling conflict. But through a satellite link I was able to sit at my study at home with my dog curled up at my feet  a cup of tea in my hand  and I could tell the pilot   I want a sample right there.  And that's exactly what the pilot did for me. That's the sort of technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago. So it allows us to sample these amazing habitats that are very far from the surface and very far from light. And so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acoustics  or sound waves. And the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water  unlike light. And so we can send out sound waves  they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back. And so in this example  a census scientist took out two ships. One would send out sound waves that would bounce back. They would be received by a second ship  and that would give us very precise estimates  in this case  of     billion herring in a period of about a minute. And that's an area about the size of Manhattan Island. And to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool  because knowing how many fish are there is really critical. We can also use satellite tags to track animals as they move through the oceans. And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe  such as this elephant seal  it's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean. And so from that we can produce these tracks. For example  the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific. Now I realize for those of you who are colorblind  this slide is not very helpful  but stick with me nonetheless. For animals that don't surface  we have something called pop up tags  which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets. And then at some period of time it pops up to the surface and  again  relays that data back to shore. Because GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools. And so from this we're able to identify these blue highways  these hot spots in the ocean  that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation. Now one of the other things that you may think about is that  when you go to the supermarket and you buy things  they're scanned. And so there's a barcode on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is. Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding. And what barcoding does is use a specific gene called CO  that's consistent within a species  but varies among species. And so what that means is we can unambiguously identify which species are which even if they look similar to each other  but may be biologically quite different. Now one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this is the story of two young women  high school students in New York City  who worked with the census. They went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City and they barcoded it. Well what they found was mislabeled fish. So for example  they found something which was sold as tuna  which is very valuable  was in fact tilapia  which is a much less valuable fish. They also found an endangered species sold as a common one. So barcoding allows us to know what we're working with and also what we're eating. The Ocean Biogeographic Information System is the database for all the census data. It's open access  you can all go in and download data as you wish. And it contains all the data from the census plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute. And so what you can do with that is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans. What I've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand. This is where our sampling effort has concentrated. Now what you can see is we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic  in the North Sea in particular  and also the east coast of North America fairly well. That's the warm colors which show a well sampled region. The cold colors  the blue and the black  show areas where we have almost no data. So even after a    year census  there are large areas that still remain unexplored. Now there are a group of scientists living in Texas  working in the Gulf of Mexico who decided really as a labor of love to pull together all the knowledge they could about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico. And so they put this together  a list of all the species  where they're known to occur  and it really seemed like a very esoteric  scientific type of exercise. But then  of course  there was the Deep Horizon oil spill. So all of a sudden  this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover  how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi billion dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years are likely to be resolved. So what did we find  Well  I could stand here for hours  but  of course  I'm not allowed to do that. But I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries from the census. So one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity  Where do we find the most species of ocean life  And what we find if we plot up the well known species is this sort of a distribution. And what we see is that for coastal tags  for those organisms that live near the shoreline  they're most diverse in the tropics. This is something we've actually known for a while  so it's not a real breakthrough. What is really exciting though is that the oceanic tags  or the ones that live far from the coast  are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes. This is the sort of data  again  that managers could use if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve. You can do this on a global scale  but you can also do it on a regional scale. And that's why biodiversity data can be so valuable. Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see  that certainly wasn't always the case. For example  while it's hard to believe that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists  it did until a few years ago when South African fishermen requested an export permit and scientists realized that this was something new to science. Similarly this Golden V kelp collected in Alaska just below the low water mark is probably a new species. Even though it's three meters long  it actually  again  eluded science. Now this guy  this bigfin squid  is seven meters in length. But to be fair  it lives in the deep waters of the Mid Atlantic Ridge  so it was a lot harder to find. But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things. This particular shrimp  we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp  it's thought to have gone extinct    years ago    at least it was  until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia. And it shows that the ocean  because of its vastness  can hide secrets for a very long time. So  Steven Spielberg  eat your heart out. If we look at distributions  in fact distributions change dramatically. And so one of the records that we had was this sooty shearwater  which undergoes these spectacular migrations all the way from New Zealand all the way up to Alaska and back again in search of endless summer as they complete their life cycles. We also talked about the White Shark Cafe. This is a location in the Pacific where white shark converge. We don't know why they converge there  we simply don't know. That's a question for the future. One of the things that we're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive. Now this little critter  it's only about half a millimeter in size  not terribly charismatic. But it was only discovered in the early     s. But the really interesting thing about it is that  a few years ago  census scientists discovered that this guy can thrive in oxygen poor sediments in the deep Mediterranean Sea. So now they know that  in fact  animals can live without oxygen  at least some of them  and that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions. If you were to suck all the water out of the ocean  this is what you'd be left behind with  and that's the biomass of life on the sea floor. Now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles and not much biomass in between. We found life in the extremes. And so there were new species that were found that live inside ice and help to support an ice based food web. And we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island. And this particular species really captured the public's attention. We also found the deepest vents known yet          meters    the hottest vents at     degrees Celsius    vents in the South Pacific and also in the Arctic where none had been found before. So even new environments are still within the domain of the discoverable. Now in terms of the unknowns  there are many. And I'm just going to summarize just a few of them very quickly for you. First of all  we might ask  how many fishes in the sea  We actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean other than marine mammals. And so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery how many more species we're likely to discover. And from that  we actually calculate that we know about        marine species and there are probably another       to       left to go. So we've done pretty well. We've got about    percent of the fish  maybe as much as    percent. But the fishes  as I say  are the best known. So our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms. Now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper that's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology. And what is does is predict how many more species there are on land and in the ocean. And what they found is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean. That means    percent  even after the census  still remain to be discovered. And so that turns out to be about two million species once all is said and done. So we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of unknowns. Now this bacterium is part of mats that are found off the coast of Chile. And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece. And so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye. But you can imagine the biomass that represents. But the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are. A single drop of seawater could contain     different types of microbes. And the oceans themselves are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types. So that's really exciting. What are they all doing out there  We actually don't know. The most exciting thing  I would say  about this census is the role of global science. And so as we see in this image of light during the night  there are lots of areas of the Earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it's much less  but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean. The other point I'd like to make about this is that this ocean's interconnected. Marine organisms do not care about international boundaries  they move where they will. And so the importance then of global collaboration becomes all the more important. We've lost a lot of paradise. For example  these tuna that were once so abundant in the North Sea are now effectively gone. There were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean  which collected more garbage than they did animals. And that's the deep sea  that's the environment that we consider to be among the most pristine left on Earth. And there are a lot of other pressures. Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with  as well as ocean warming  and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs. On the scale of decades  in our lifetimes  we're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs. And I could spend the rest of my time  which is getting very limited  going through this litany of concerns about the ocean  but I want to end on a more positive note. And so the grand challenge then is to try and make sure that we preserve what's left  because there is still spectacular beauty. And the oceans are so productive  there's so much going on in there that's of relevance to humans that we really need to  even from a selfish perspective  try to do better than we have in the past. So we need to recognize those hot spots and do our best to protect them. When we look at pictures like this  they take our breath away  in addition to helping to give us breath by the oxygen that the oceans provide. Census scientists worked in the rain  they worked in the cold  they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery  the still vast unknown  the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life. So whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of Chile  whether you're a stockbroker in New York City or whether you're a TEDster living in Edinburgh  the oceans matter. And as the oceans go so shall we. Thanks for listening.\n",
      "Well  I'm an ocean chemist. I look at the chemistry of the ocean today. I look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past. The way I look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals. You can see an image of one of these corals behind me. It was collected from close to Antarctica  thousands of meters below the sea  so  very different than the kinds of corals you may have been lucky enough to see if you've had a tropical holiday. So I'm hoping that this talk will give you a four dimensional view of the ocean. Two dimensions  such as this beautiful two dimensional image of the sea surface temperature. This was taken using satellite  so it's got tremendous spatial resolution. The overall features are extremely easy to understand. The equatorial regions are warm because there's more sunlight. The polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight. And that allows big icecaps to build up on Antarctica and up in the Northern Hemisphere. If you plunge deep into the sea  or even put your toes in the sea  you know it gets colder as you go down  and that's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean come from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense. If we travel back in time        years ago  the earth looked very much different. And I've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences you would have seen if you went back that long. The icecaps were much bigger. They covered lots of the continent  and they extended out over the ocean. Sea level was     meters lower. Carbon dioxide  levels  were very much lower than they are today. So the earth was probably about three to five degrees colder overall  and much  much colder in the polar regions. What I'm trying to understand  and what other colleagues of mine are trying to understand  is how we moved from that cold climate condition to the warm climate condition that we enjoy today. We know from ice core research that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn't smooth  as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation. And we know this from ice cores  because if you drill down into ice  you find annual bands of ice  and you can see this in the iceberg. You can see those blue white layers. Gases are trapped in the ice cores  so we can measure CO     that's why we know CO  was lower in the past    and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature in the polar regions. And if you move in time from        years ago to the modern day  you see that temperature increased. It didn't increase smoothly. Sometimes it increased very rapidly  then there was a plateau  then it increased rapidly. It was different in the two polar regions  and CO  also increased in jumps. So we're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this. The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon  about    times more than is in the atmosphere. It also acts to transport heat across the equator  and the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls primary productivity. So if we want to find out what's going on down in the deep sea  we really need to get down there  see what's there and start to explore. This is some spectacular footage coming from a seamount about a kilometer deep in international waters in the equatorial Atlantic  far from land. You're amongst the first people to see this bit of the seafloor  along with my research team. You're probably seeing new species. We don't know. You'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy. You can see beautiful bubblegum corals. There are brittle stars growing on these corals. Those are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals. There are corals made of different forms of calcium carbonate growing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain  and the dark sort of stuff  those are fossilized corals  and we're going to talk a little more about those as we travel back in time. To do that  we need to charter a research boat. This is the James Cook  an ocean class research vessel moored up in Tenerife. Looks beautiful  right  Great  if you're not a great mariner. Sometimes it looks a little more like this. This is us trying to make sure that we don't lose precious samples. Everyone's scurrying around  and I get terribly seasick  so it's not always a lot of fun  but overall it is. So we've got to become a really good mapper to do this. You don't see that kind of spectacular coral abundance everywhere. It is global and it is deep  but we need to really find the right places. We just saw a global map  and overlaid was our cruise passage from last year. This was a seven week cruise  and this is us  having made our own maps of about        square kilometers of the seafloor in seven weeks  but that's only a tiny fraction of the seafloor. We're traveling from west to east  over part of the ocean that would look featureless on a big scale map  but actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest. So with the maps that we make on board  we get about     meter resolution  enough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment  but not enough to see very much. To do that  we need to fly remotely operated vehicles about five meters off the seafloor. And if we do that  we can get maps that are one meter resolution down thousands of meters. Here is a remotely operated vehicle  a research grade vehicle. You can see an array of big lights on the top. There are high definition cameras  manipulator arms  and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples. Here we are on our first dive of this particular cruise  plunging down into the ocean. We go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships. And we go down  and these are the kinds of things you see. These are deep sea sponges  meter scale. This is a swimming holothurian    it's a small sea slug  basically. This is slowed down. Most of the footage I'm showing you is speeded up  because all of this takes a lot of time. This is a beautiful holothurian as well. And this animal you're going to see coming up was a big surprise. I've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised. This was after about    hours of work and we were all a bit trigger happy  and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past. It's called a pyrosome or colonial tunicate  if you like. This wasn't what we were looking for. We were looking for corals  deep sea corals. You're going to see a picture of one in a moment. It's small  about five centimeters high. It's made of calcium carbonate  so you can see its tentacles there  moving in the ocean currents. An organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years. And as it grows  it takes in chemicals from the ocean. And the chemicals  or the amount of chemicals  depends on the temperature  it depends on the pH  it depends on the nutrients. And if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton  we can then go back  collect fossil specimens  and reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past. And here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system  and we put it into a sampling container. We can do this very carefully  I should add. Some of these organisms live even longer. This is a black coral called Leiopathes  an image taken by my colleague  Brendan Roark  about     meters below Hawaii. Four thousand years is a long time. If you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up  this is about     microns across. And Brendan took some analyses across this coral    you can see the marks    and he's been able to show that these are actual annual bands  so even at     meters deep in the ocean  corals can record seasonal changes  which is pretty spectacular. But       years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum. So what do we do  We go in for these fossil specimens. This is what makes me really unpopular with my research team. So going along  there's giant sharks everywhere  there are pyrosomes  there are swimming holothurians  there's giant sponges  but I make everyone go down to these dead fossil areas and spend ages kind of shoveling around on the seafloor. And we pick up all these corals  bring them back  we sort them out. But each one of these is a different age  and if we can find out how old they are and then we can measure those chemical signals  this helps us to find out what's been going on in the ocean in the past. So on the left hand image here  I've taken a slice through a coral  polished it very carefully and taken an optical image. On the right hand side  we've taken that same piece of coral  put it in a nuclear reactor  induced fission  and every time there's some decay  you can see that marked out in the coral  so we can see the uranium distribution. Why are we doing this  Uranium is a very poorly regarded element  but I love it. The decay helps us find out about the rates and dates of what's going on in the ocean. And if you remember from the beginning  that's what we want to get at when we're thinking about climate. So we use a laser to analyze uranium and one of its daughter products  thorium  in these corals  and that tells us exactly how old the fossils are. This beautiful animation of the Southern Ocean I'm just going to use illustrate how we're using these corals to get at some of the ancient ocean feedbacks. You can see the density of the surface water in this animation by Ryan Abernathey. It's just one year of data  but you can see how dynamic the Southern Ocean is. The intense mixing  particularly the Drake Passage  which is shown by the box  is really one of the strongest currents in the world coming through here  flowing from west to east. It's very turbulently mixed  because it's moving over those great big undersea mountains  and this allows CO  and heat to exchange with the atmosphere in and out. And essentially  the oceans are breathing through the Southern Ocean. We've collected corals from back and forth across this Antarctic passage  and we've found quite a surprising thing from my uranium dating  the corals migrated from south to north during this transition from the glacial to the interglacial. We don't really know why  but we think it's something to do with the food source and maybe the oxygen in the water. So here we are. I'm going to illustrate what I think we've found about climate from those corals in the Southern Ocean. We went up and down sea mountains. We collected little fossil corals. This is my illustration of that. We think back in the glacial  from the analysis we've made in the corals  that the deep part of the Southern Ocean was very rich in carbon  and there was a low density layer sitting on top. That stops carbon dioxide coming out of the ocean. We then found corals that are of an intermediate age  and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition. That allows carbon to come out of the deep ocean. And then if we analyze corals closer to the modern day  or indeed if we go down there today anyway and measure the chemistry of the corals  we see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out. So this is the way we can use fossil corals to help us learn about the environment. So I want to leave you with this last slide. It's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that I showed you. This is a spectacular coral garden. We didn't even expect to find things this beautiful. It's thousands of meters deep. There are new species. It's just a beautiful place. There are fossils in amongst  and now I've trained you to appreciate the fossil corals that are down there. So next time you're lucky enough to fly over the ocean or sail over the ocean  just think    there are massive sea mountains down there that nobody's ever seen before  and there are beautiful corals. Thank you.\n",
      "Ten years ago  I had my first exhibition here. I had no idea if it would work or was at all possible  but with a few small steps and a very steep learning curve  I made my first sculpture  called  The Lost Correspondent.  Teaming up with a marine biologist and a local dive center  I submerged the work off the coast of Grenada  in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan. And then this incredible thing happened. It transformed. One sculpture became two. Two quickly became   . And before I knew it  we had the world's first underwater sculpture park. In       I moved to Mexico and started by casting local fisherman. This grew to a small community  to almost an entire movement of people in defense of the sea. And then finally  to an underwater museum  with over     living sculptures. Gardening  it seems  is not just for greenhouses. We've since scaled up the designs   Ocean Atlas   in the Bahamas  rising    feet up to the surface and weighing over    tons  to now currently in Lanzarote  where I'm making an underwater botanical garden  the first of its kind in the Atlantic Ocean. Each project  we use materials and designs that help encourage life  a long lasting pH neutral cement provides a stable and permanent platform. It is textured to allow coral polyps to attach. We position them down current from natural reefs so that after spawning  there's areas for them to settle. The formations are all configured so that they aggregate fish on a really large scale. Even this VW Beetle has an internal living habitat to encourage crustaceans such as lobsters and sea urchins. So why exhibit my work in the ocean  Because honestly  it's really not easy. When you're in the middle of the sea under a hundred foot crane  trying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor  you start to wonder whether I shouldn't have taken up watercolor painting instead. But in the end  the results always blow my mind. The ocean is the most incredible exhibition space an artist could ever wish for. You have amazing lighting effects changing by the hour  explosions of sand covering the sculptures in a cloud of mystery  a unique timeless quality and the procession of inquisitive visitors  each lending their own special touch to the site. But over the years  I've realized that the greatest thing about what we do  the really humbling thing about the work  is that as soon as we submerge the sculptures  they're not ours anymore  because as soon as we sink them  the sculptures  they belong to the sea. As new reefs form  a new world literally starts to evolve  a world that continuously amazes me. It's a bit of a clich   but nothing man made can ever match the imagination of nature. Sponges look like veins across the faces. Staghorn coral morphs the form. Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed. Tunicates explode from the faces. Sea urchins crawl across the bodies feeding at night. Coralline algae applies a kind of purple paint. The deepest red I've ever seen in my life lives underwater. Gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves. Purple sponges breathe water like air. And grey angelfish glide silently overhead. And the amazing response we've had to these works tells me that we've managed to plug into something really primal  because it seems that these images translate across the world  and that's made me focus on my responsibility as an artist and about what I'm trying to achieve. I'm standing here today on this boat in the middle of the ocean  and this couldn't be a better place to talk about the really  really important effect of my work. Because as we all know  our reefs are dying  and our oceans are in trouble. So here's the thing  the most used  searched and shared image of all my work thus far is this. And I think this is for a reason  or at least I hope it is. What I really hope is that people are beginning to understand that when we think of the environment and the destruction of nature  that we need to start thinking about our oceans  too. Since building these sites  we've seen some phenomenal and unexpected results. Besides creating over     square meters of new habitats and living reef  visitors to the marine park in Cancun now divide half their time between the museum and the natural reefs  providing significant rest for natural  overstressed areas. Visitors to  Ocean Atlas  in the Bahamas highlighted a leak from a nearby oil refinery. The subsequent international media forced the local government to pledge    million dollars in coastal cleanups. The sculpture park in Grenada was instrumental in the government designating a spot    a marine protected area. Entrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers to manage tourism and fishing quotas. The site was actually listed as a  Wonder of the World  by National Geographic. So why are we all here today in this room  What do we all have in common  I think we all share a fear that we don't protect our oceans enough. And one way of thinking about this is that we don't regard our oceans as sacred  and we should. When we see incredible places    like the Himalayas or the La Sagrada Fam lia  or the Mona Lisa  even    when we see these incredible places and things  we understand their importance. We call them sacred  and we do our best to cherish them  to protect them and to keep them safe. But in order to do that  we are the ones that have to assign that value  otherwise  it will be desecrated by someone who doesn't understand that value. So I want to finish up tonight by talking about sacred things. When we were naming the site in Cancun  we named it a museum for a very important and simple reason  museums are places of preservation  of conservation and of education. They're places where we keep objects of great value to us  where we simply treasure them for them being themselves. If someone was to throw an egg at the Sistine Chapel  we'd all go crazy. If someone wanted to build a seven star hotel at the bottom of the Grand Canyon  then we would laugh them out of Arizona. Yet every day we dredge  pollute and overfish our oceans. And I think it's easier for us to do that  because when we see the ocean  we don't see the havoc we're wreaking. Because for most people  the ocean is like this. And it's really hard to think of something that's just so plain and so enormous  as fragile. It's simply too massive  too vast  too endless. And what do you see here  I think most people actually look past to the horizon. So I think there's a real danger that we never really see the sea  and if we don't really see it  if it doesn't have its own iconography  if we miss its majesty  then there's a big danger that we take it for granted. Cancun is famous for spring break  tequila and foam parties. And its waters are where frat boys can ride around on Jet Skis and banana boats. But because of our work there  there's now a little corner of Cancun that is simply precious for being itself. And we don't want to stop in Grenada  in Cancun or the Bahamas. Just last month  I installed these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in the Thames River  in central London  right in front of the Houses of Parliament  putting a stark message about climate change in front of the people that have the power to help change things. Because for me  this is just the beginning of the mission. We want to team up with other inventors  creators  philanthropists  educators  biologists  to see better futures for our oceans. And we want to see beyond sculpture  beyond art  even. Say you're a    year old kid from the city  and you've never seen the ocean. And instead of getting taken to the natural history museum or an aquarium  you get taken out to the ocean  to an underwater Noah's Ark  which you can access through a dry glass viewing tunnel  where you can see all the wildlife of the land be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean. Clearly  it would blow your mind. So let's think big and let's think deep. Who knows where our imagination and willpower can lead us  I hope that by bringing our art into the ocean  that not only do we take advantage of amazing creativity and visual impact of the setting  but that we are also giving something back  and by encouraging new environments to thrive  and in some way opening up a new    or maybe it's a really old way of seeing the seas  as delicate  precious places  worthy of our protection. Our oceans are sacred. Thank you.\n",
      "I would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for National Geographic magazine. I guess I became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because I fell in love with the sea as a child. And I wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater  incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors. And after even    years of doing this  after    years of exploring the ocean  I never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea. But more and more frequently these days I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well  things that I don't think most people realize. And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story. I want people to see what's happening underwater  both the horror and the magic. The first story that I did for National Geographic  where I recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage  was a story I proposed on harp seals. The story I wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to engage in courtship  mating and to have their pups. And all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide. And because I'm an underwater photographer  I wanted to do this story from both above and below  to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first swim in the icy    degree water. But as I got more involved in the story  I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore. The first was that these animals continue to be hunted  killed with hakapiks at about eight     days old. It actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet  with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year. But as disturbing as that is  I think the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming. This is an aerial picture that I made that shows the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season. And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture  there's a lot of water as well  which wasn't there historically. And the ice that is there is quite thin. The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms. They only need    days from the moment they're born until they're on their own. But if they don't get    days  they can fall into the ocean and die. This is a photo that I made showing one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old    still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly    that has fallen in because of the thin ice  and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase. This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there. I read that last year the pup mortality rate was     percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. So  clearly  this species has a lot of problems going forward. This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic. And it received quite a bit of attention. And with that  I saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems. So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis  in part because I had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last    years  but also because I read a scientific paper that stated that    percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last    or    years. These are the tuna  the billfish and the sharks. When I read that  I was blown away by those numbers. I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet  but it really wasn't  so I wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story. I wanted it to be more like war photography  where I was making harder hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet. The first component of the story that I thought was essential  however  was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating. You know  I think people go into a restaurant  and somebody orders a steak  and we all know where steak comes from  and somebody orders a chicken  and we know what a chicken is  but when they're eating bluefin sushi  do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming  These are the lions and tigers of the sea. In reality  these animals have no terrestrial counterpart  they're unique in the world. These are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year. If we weren't so efficient at catching them  because they grow their entire life  would have    year old bluefin out there that weigh a ton. But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them  and their stocks have collapsed worldwide. This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market that I photographed a couple years ago. And every single day these tuna  bluefin like this  are stacked up like cordwood  just warehouse after warehouse. As I wandered around and made these pictures  it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store  you know. We can't keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result. I also  with the story  wanted to show readers how fish are caught  some of the methods that are used to catch fish  like a bottom trawler  which is one of the most common methods in the world. This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp  but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world. You have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end. And as this assembly is towed through the water  the doors meet resistance with the ocean  and it opens the mouth of the net  and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom. And this just drags over the bottom  in this case to catch shrimp. But as you can imagine  it's catching everything else in its path as well. And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom  things like sponges and corals  that critical habitat for other animals. This photograph I made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour. So he had a handful of shrimp  maybe seven or eight shrimp  and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch. These are animals that died in the process  but have no commercial value. So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner  maybe seven or eight shrimp and    pounds of other animals that had to die in the process. And to make that point even more visual  I swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death  you know  animals like guitarfish  bat rays  flounder  pufferfish  that only an hour before  were on the bottom of the ocean  alive  but now being thrown back as trash. I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because  currently on planet Earth  we're killing over     million sharks every single year. But before I went out to photograph this component  I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers You know  I think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark. But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net. And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible  it struck me as sort of a crucifixion  if you will. This ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in National Geographic. And I hope that it helped readers to take notice of this problem of     million sharks. And because I love sharks    I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks    I wanted to do another  more celebratory  story about sharks  as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation. So I went to the Bahamas because there're very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days  but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy  largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago. And I wanted to show several species that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations. One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach  in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water. This is a low altitude photograph that I made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind. But the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters. I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary. And with this photograph of a beautiful    feet  probably    feet  I guess  female tiger shark  I sort of think I got to that goal  where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose  and my strobe created a shadow on her face. And I think it's a gentler picture  a little less threatening  a little more respectful of the species. I also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead  an animal that really hadn't been photographed much until maybe about seven or    years ago. It's a very solitary creature. But this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science in both Florida and in the Bahamas. You know  we know almost nothing about them. We don't know where they migrate to or from  where they mate  where they have their pups  and yet  hammerhead populations in the Atlantic have declined about    percent in the last    to    years. You know  we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them. This is the oceanic whitetip shark  an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species  if you pay attention to such lists. But it's an animal that's about    percent in decline throughout most of its range. Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water  and because we weren't working on the bottom  I brought along a shark cage here  and my friend  shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage. You'll see that the photographer  of course  was not inside the cage here  so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess. And lastly with this story  I also wanted to focus on baby sharks  shark nurseries. And I went to the island of Bimini  in the Bahamas  to work with lemon shark pups. This is a photo of a lemon shark pup  and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves. This is a very sort of un shark like photograph. It's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture. But  you know  here we see a shark that's maybe    or    inches long swimming in about a foot of water. But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two  three years of their lives  until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef. After I left Bimini  I actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort. And other recent stories have looked at single  flagship species  if you will  that are at risk in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats. One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle. This is the largest  widest ranging  deepest diving and oldest of all turtle species. Here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of Trinidad. These are animals whose lineage dates back about     million years. And there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by. And today  they crawl out and see condominiums. But despite this amazing longevity  they're now considered critically endangered. In the Pacific  where I made this photograph  their stocks have declined about    percent in the last    years. This is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey. Only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity. But that's due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore. Nature has learned to compensate with that  and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds. But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses  human things  like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net. I actually jumped in and photographed this  and with the fisherman's permission  I cut the turtle out  and it was able to swim free. But  you know  thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate  and the species' future is in great danger. Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with is the story I did on the right whale. And essentially  the story is this with right whales  that about a million years ago  there was one species of right whale on the planet  but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated  the species sort of separated  and today we have essentially two distinct stocks. We have the Southern right whale that we see here and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida. Now  both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers  but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they're located in places farther away from human activity. The North Atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales  they live along the east coast of North America  United States and Canada  and they have to deal with all these urban ills. This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida. You can see the coal burning plant in the background. They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean  and maybe even affecting their reproduction. They also get entangled in fishing gear. This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale. And those white markings are not natural markings. These are entanglement scars.    percent of the population has such scars  but most don't shed the gear  things like lobster traps and crab pots. They hold on to them  and it eventually kills them. And the other problem is they get hit by ships. And this was an animal that was struck by a ship in Nova Scotia  Canada being towed in  where they did a necropsy to confirm the cause of death  which was indeed a ship strike. So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals and keeping their numbers very low. And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population  I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales that had only been discovered about    years ago in the sub Antarctic of New Zealand  a place called the Auckland Islands. I went down there in the winter time. And these are animals that had never seen humans before  and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen. And I got in the water with them  and I was amazed at how curious they were. This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about    feet and one of these amazingly beautiful     foot     ton whales  like a city bus just swimming up  you know. They were in perfect condition  very fat and healthy  robust  no entanglement scars  the way they're supposed to look. You know  I read that the pilgrims  when they landed at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in       wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay on the backs of right whales. And we can't go back and see that today  but maybe we can preserve what we have left. And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope  a story I did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing  the global fish crisis story. I settled on working in the country of New Zealand because New Zealand was rather progressive  and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean. And I really wanted this story to be about three things  I wanted it to be about abundance  about diversity and about resilience. And one of the first places I worked was a reserve called Goat Island in Leigh of New Zealand. What the scientists there told me was that when protected this first marine reserve in       they hoped and expected that certain things might happen. For example  they hoped that certain species of fish like the New Zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction. And they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen. For example  these fish predate on sea urchins  and when the fish were all gone  all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins. But when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population  low and behold  kelp forests emerged in shallow water. And that's because the urchins eat kelp. So when the fish control the urchin population  the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium. You know  this is probably how the ocean looked here one or     years ago  but nobody was around to tell us. I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well  in beautiful  fragile  protected areas like in Fiordland  where this sea pen colony was found. Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color. In the northern part of New Zealand  I dove in the blue water  where the water's a little warmer  and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon. Every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy  from tiny  little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting sponge or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold. And I wanted to finish with this photograph  a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand when I just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me. And I was in a place that had only been protected about    years ago. And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years  and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the     s. And that's because it's been protected  that it has come back. So I think the message is clear. The ocean is  indeed  resilient and tolerant to a point  but we must be good custodians. I became an underwater photographer because I fell in love with the sea  and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it  and I don't think it's too late. Thank you very much.\n",

      "In the past several days  I heard people talking about China. And also  I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet. Something is very challenging to me. I want to make my friends understand  China is complicated. So I always want to tell the story  like  one hand it is that  the other hand is that. You can't just tell a one sided story. I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country. BRIC country means Brazil  Russia  India and China. This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy. But at the same time  on the other hand  China is a SICK country  the terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers    file. He said the SICK country means Syria  Iran  China and North Korea. The four countries have no access to Facebook. So basically  China is a SICK BRIC country. Another project was built up to watch China and Chinese Internet. And now  today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years  from that wall. So  if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones  you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom. It prevents weird things from the north. Same was true for China. In the north  there was a great wall  Chang Cheng. It protected China from invaders for       years. But China also has a great firewall. That's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world. It's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas  from the universal values  but also to prevent China's own citizens to access the global free Internet  and even separate themselves into blocks  not united. So  basically the  Internet  has two Internets. One is the Internet  the other is the Chinanet. But if you think the Chinanet is something like a deadland  wasteland  I think it's wrong. But we also use a very simple metaphor  the cat and the mouse game  to describe in the past    years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship  government censorship  the cat  and the Chinese Internet users. That means us  the mouse. But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple. So today I want to upgrade it to  .  version. In China  we have     million Internet users. That's the biggest population of Netizens  Internet users  in the whole world. So even though China's is a totally censored Internet  but still  Chinese Internet society is really booming. How to make it  It's simple. You have Google  we have Baidu. You have Twitter  we have Weibo. You have Facebook  we have Renren. You have YouTube  we have Youku and Tudou. The Chinese government blocked every single international Web  .  service  and we Chinese copycat every one. So  that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship. That's not only to censor you. Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple  Block and clone. On the one hand  he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network  which is very important  people really love social networking. But on the other hand  they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want. That's also the reason Google was pulled out from China  because they can't accept the fact that Chinese government wants to keep the server. Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands. For example  Mubarak  he shut down the Internet. He wanted to prevent the Netizens  from criticizing  him. But once Netizens can't go online  they go in the street. And now the result is very simple. We all know Mubarak is technically dead. But also  Ben Ali  Tunisian president  didn't follow the second rule. That means keep the server in your hands. He allowed Facebook  a U.S. based service  to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia. So he can't prevent it  his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption. The same thing happend. He was the first to topple during the Arab Spring. But those two very smart international censorship policies didn't prevent Chinese social media  from  becoming a really public sphere  a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials. Because we have     million microbloggers in China. It's the entire population of the United States. So when these     million people  microbloggers  even they block the tweet in our censored platform. But itself    the Chinanet    but itself can create very powerful energy  which has never happened in the Chinese history.       in July  two  unclear  trains crashed  in Wenzhou  a southern city. Right after the train crash  authorities literally wanted to cover up the train  bury the train. So it angered the Chinese Netizens. The first five days after the train crash  there were    million criticisms of the posting on social media  which never happened in Chinese history. And later this year  the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for    years. And also  recently  very funny debate between the Beijing Environment Ministry and the American Embassy in Beijing because the Ministry blamed the American Embassy for intervening in Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing. So  the up is the Embassy data  the PM  . . He showed      they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group. So a suggestion  it's not good to go outside. But that is the Ministry's data. He shows   . He says it's good. It's good to go outside. But    percent of Chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the Embassy's side. I live in Beijing. Every day  I just watch the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window. Why is Chinese social networking  even within the censorship  so booming  Part of the reason is Chinese languages. You know  Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of a limitation of     characters. But in English it's    words or a sentence with a short link. Maybe in Germany  in German language  it may be just  Aha   But in Chinese language  it's really about     characters  means a paragraph  a story. You can almost have all the journalistic elements there. For example  this is Hamlet  of Shakespeare. It's the same content. One  you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to  .  English tweets. Chinese is always cheating  right  So because of this  the Chinese really regard this microblogging as a media  not only a headline to media. And also  the clone  Sina company is the guy who cloned Twitter. It even has its own name  with Weibo.  Weibo  is the Chinese translation for  microblog . It has its own innovation. At the commenting area   it makes  the Chinese Weibo more like Facebook  rather than the original Twitter. So these innovations and clones  as the Weibo and microblogging  when it came to China in       it immediately became a media platform itself. It became the media platform of     million readers. It became the media. Anything not mentioned in Weibo  it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public. But also  Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life. For example  they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard. We had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system  because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth  The emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs. So that's why the petitioner  the victims  the peasants  want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government  they want the emperor to settle the problem. But when more and more people go to Beijing  they also cause the risk of a revolution. So they send them back in recent years. And even some of them were put into black jails. But now we have Weibo  so I call it the Weibo petition. People just use their cell phones to tweet. So your sad stories  by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters  professors or celebrities. One of them is Yao Chen  she is the most popular microblogger in China  who has about    million followers. They're almost like a national TV station. If you    so a sad story will be picked up by her. So this Weibo social media  even in the censorship  still gave the Chinese a real chance for     million people every day chatting together  talking together. It's like a big TED  right  But also  it is like the first time a public sphere happened in China. Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people. But also  the cat  the censorship  is not sleeping. It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo. For example  you can't post the name of the president  Hu Jintao  and also you can't post the city of Chongqing  the name  and until recently  you can't search the surname of top leaders. So  the Chinese are very good at these puns and alternative wording and even memes. They even name themselves    you know  use the name of this world changing battle between the grass mud horse and the river crab. The grass mud horse is caon ma  is the phonogram for motherfucker  the Netizens call themselves. River crab is h xi   is the phonogram for harmonization  for censorship. So that's kind of a caon ma versus the h xi   that's very good. So  when some very political  exciting moments happened  you can see on Weibo  you see a lot of very weird stories happened. Weird phrases and words  even if you have a PhD of Chinese language  you can't understand them. But you can't even expand more  no  because Chinese Sina Weibo  when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com. That means from the very beginning  Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government  we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime. For example  anything you want to post  like  get together  or  meet up  or  walk   it is automatically recorded and data mined and reported to a poll for further political analyzing. Even if you want to have some gathering  before you go there  the police are already waiting for you. Why  Because they have the data. They have everything in their hands. So they can use the      scenario data mining of the dissident. So the crackdown is very serious. But I want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse. The cat is the censorship  but Chinese is not only one cat  but also has local cats. Central cat and local cats. You know  the server is in the  central  cats' hands  so even that    when the Netizens criticize the local government  the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing. Without bribing the central cats  he can do nothing  only apologize. So these three years  in the past three years  social movements about microblogging really changed local government  became more and more transparent  because they can't access the data. The server is in Beijing. The story about the train crash  maybe the question is not about why    million criticisms in five days  but why the Chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online. It's never happened before. And so it's very simple  because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy  this independent kingdom. So they want an excuse    public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him. But also  the Bo Xilai case recently  very big news  he's a princeling. But from February to April this year  Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors. You can almost joke everything about these princelings  everything  It's almost like you're living in the United States. But if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about Beijing  you definitely will be arrested. So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window. So Chinese in China  censorship is normal. Something you find is  freedom is weird. Something will happen behind it. Because he was a very popular Leftist leader  so the central government wanted to purge him  and he was very cute  he convinced all the Chinese people  why he is so bad. So Weibo  the     million public sphere  became a very good  convenient tool for a political fight. But this technology is very new  but technically is very old. It was made famous by Chairman Mao  Mao Zedong  because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government. It's very simple  because Chinese central government doesn't need to even lead the public opinion. They just give them a target window to not censor people. Not censoring in China has become a political tool. So that's the update about this game  cat and mouse. Social media changed Chinese mindset. More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright  not some imported American privilege. But also  it gave the Chinese a national public sphere for people to  it's like a training of their citizenship  preparing for future democracy. But it didn't change the Chinese political system  and also the Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions. So  what's the future  After all  we are the mouse. Whatever the future is  we should fight against the  cat . There is not only in China  but also in the United States there are some very small  cute but bad cats. SOPA  PIPA  ACTA  TPP and ITU. And also  like Facebook and Google  they claim they are friends of the mouse  but sometimes we see them dating the cats. So my conclusion is very simple. We Chinese fight for our freedom  you just watch your bad cats. Don't let them hook  up  with the Chinese cats. Only in this way  in the future  we will achieve the dreams of the mouse  that we can tweet anytime  anywhere  without fear. Thank you.\n",
      "The world is changing with really remarkable speed. If you look at the chart at the top here  you'll see that in       these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And if you look at the chart for       it's projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy  and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis. A couple of weeks ago  I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States. Goldman Sachs projected     . The post crisis projection is     . That's just a decade away. China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects. First of all  it's a huge developing country with a population of  .  billion people  which has been growing for over    years at around    percent a year. And within a decade  it will have the largest economy in the world. Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country  rather than a developed country. Secondly  for the first time in the modern era  the dominant country in the world    which I think is what China will become    will be not from the West and from very  very different civilizational roots. Now  I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize  they also westernize. This is an illusion. It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition  markets and technology. It is not. It is also shaped equally by history and culture. China is not like the West  and it will not become like the West. It will remain in very fundamental respects very different. Now the big question here is obviously  how do we make sense of China  How do we try to understand what China is  And the problem we have in the West at the moment  by and large  is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms  using Western ideas. We can't. Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like  just as a beginning. The first is this  that China is not really a nation state. Okay  it's called itself a nation state for the last hundred years  but everyone who knows anything about China knows it's a lot older than this. This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in     B.C. at the end of the warring state period    the birth of modern China. And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China. Or immediately afterward  the Han Dynasty  still       years ago. And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China  which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now. Now what is extraordinary about this is  what gives China its sense of being China  what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese  comes not from the last hundred years  not from the nation state period  which is what happened in the West  but from the period  if you like  of the civilization state. I'm thinking here  for example  of customs like ancestral worship  of a very distinctive notion of the state  likewise  a very distinctive notion of the family  social relationships like guanxi  Confucian values and so on. These are all things that come from the period of the civilization state. In other words  China  unlike the Western states and most countries in the world  is shaped by its sense of civilization  its existence as a civilization state  rather than as a nation state. And there's one other thing to add to this  and that is this  Of course we know China's big  huge  demographically and geographically  with a population of  .  billion people. What we often aren't really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic  and in many ways very decentralized. You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing  even though we think this to be the case. It's never been the case. So this is China  a civilization state  rather than a nation state. And what does it mean  Well  I think it has all sorts of profound implications. I'll give you two quick ones. The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity  is the maintenance of Chinese civilization. You know        years ago  Europe  breakdown    the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire. It divided  and it's remained divided ever since. China  over the same time period  went in exactly the opposite direction  very painfully holding this huge civilization  civilization state  together. The second is maybe more prosaic  which is Hong Kong. Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in       You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was. One country  two systems. And I'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them.  Window dressing. When China gets its hands on Hong Kong  that won't be the case.  Thirteen years on  the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in     . We were wrong. Why were we wrong  We were wrong because we thought  naturally enough  in nation state ways. Think of German unification      . What happened  Well  basically the East was swallowed by the West. One nation  one system. That is the nation state mentality. But you can't run a country like China  a civilization state  on the basis of one civilization  one system. It doesn't work. So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong    as it will be to the question of Taiwan    was a natural response  one civilization  many systems. Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China    maybe not sort of a comfortable one. The Chinese have a very  very different conception of race to most other countries. Do you know  of the  .  billion Chinese  over    percent of them think they belong to the same race  the Han  Now  this is completely different from the world's  other  most populous countries. India  the United States  Indonesia  Brazil    all of them are multiracial. The Chinese don't feel like that. China is only multiracial really at the margins. So the question is  why  Well the reason  I think  essentially is  again  back to the civilization state. A history of at least       years  a history of conquest  occupation  absorption  assimilation and so on  led to the process by which  over time  this notion of the Han emerged    of course  nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity. Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that  without the Han  China could never have held together. The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together. The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference. They really believe in their own superiority  and they are disrespectful of those who are not. Hence their attitude  for example  to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans. Or let me give you my third building block  the Chinese state. Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West. Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think    in these days at least    that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy. The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state. And the reason for this is because    well  there are two reasons  I think. And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy  because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy. And the reason for this is  firstly  because the state in China is given a very special    it enjoys a very special significance as the representative  the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization  of the civilization state. This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role. And the second reason is because  whereas in Europe and North America  the state's power is continuously challenged    I mean in the European tradition  historically against the church  against other sectors of the aristocracy  against merchants and so on    for       years  the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged. It's had no serious rivals. So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history. The result  by the way  is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state. Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder  a stranger  certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained  the Chinese don't see the state like that at all. The Chinese view the state as an intimate    not just as an intimate actually  as a member of the family    not just in fact as a member of the family  but as the head of the family  the patriarch of the family. This is the Chinese view of the state    very  very different to ours. It's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West. And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here  in the Chinese context  is a new kind of paradigm  which is different from anything we've had to think about in the past. Know that China believes in the market and the state. I mean  Adam Smith  already writing in the late   th century  said   The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe.  And  apart from the Mao period  that has remained more or less the case ever since. But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state. The state is everywhere in China. I mean  it's leading firms    many of them are still publicly owned. Private firms  however large they are  like Lenovo  depend in many ways on state patronage. Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state. And the state  of course  its authority flows into lots of other areas    as we are familiar with    with something like the one child policy. Moreover  this is a very old state tradition  a very old tradition of statecraft. I mean  if you want an illustration of this  the Great Wall is one. But this is another  this is the Grand Canal  which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C. and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D. It went for       miles  linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai. So there's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China  which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today  which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China. So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China    the civilization state  the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society. And yet we still insist  by and large  in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience  looking at it through Western eyes  using Western concepts. If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong    our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect    this is the reason. Unfortunately  I think  I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality. It's kind of arrogant. It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best  and therefore we have the universal measure. And secondly  it's ignorant. We refuse to really address the issue of difference. You know  there's a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen  the American historian. And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures. But it's not. In many ways  it's the most parochial  because for     years  the West has been so dominant in the world that it's not really needed to understand other cultures  other civilizations. Because  at the end of the day  it could  if necessary by force  get its own way. Whereas those cultures    virtually the rest of the world  in fact  which have been in a far weaker position  vis a vis the West    have been thereby forced to understand the West  because of the West's presence in those societies. And therefore  they are  as a result  more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West. I mean  take the question of East Asia. East Asia  Japan  Korea  China  etc.    a third of the world's population lives there. Now the largest economic region in the world. And I'll tell you now  that East Asianers  people from East Asia  are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia. Now this point is very germane  I'm afraid  to the present. Because what's happening  Back to that chart at the beginning  the Goldman Sachs chart. What is happening is that  very rapidly in historical terms  the world is being driven and shaped  not by the old developed countries  but by the developing world. We've seen this in terms of the G   usurping very rapidly the position of the G   or the G . And there are two consequences of this. First  the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world. There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago    Copenhagen  climate change conference. Europe was not at the final negotiating table. When did that last happen  I would wager it was probably about     years ago. And that is what is going to happen in the future. And the second implication is that the world will inevitably  as a consequence  become increasingly unfamiliar to us  because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with  or conversant with. And at last  I'm afraid    take Europe  America is slightly different    but Europeans by and large  I have to say  are ignorant  are unaware about the way the world is changing. Some people    I've got an English friend in China  and he said   The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion.  Well  maybe that's true  maybe that's an exaggeration. But there's another problem which goes along with this    that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world    and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future. I mean  Europe once  of course  once commanded the future in its confidence. Take the   th century  for example. But this  alas  is no longer true. If you want to feel the future  if you want to taste the future  try China    there's old Confucius. This is a railway station the likes of which you've never seen before. It doesn't even look like a railway station. This is the new  Wuhan  railway station for the high speed trains. China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together. Or take this  now this is an idea  but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing. Here you have a megabus  on the upper deck carries about       people. It travels on rails down a suburban road  and the cars travel underneath it. And it does speeds of up to about     miles an hour. Now this is the way things are going to move  because China has a very specific problem  which is different from Europe and different from the United States  China has huge numbers of people and no space. So this is a solution to a situation where China's going to have many  many  many cities over    million people. Okay  so how would I like to finish  Well  what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us  I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it. But I want to argue  above all  a big picture positive for this world. For     years  the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population. That's what Europe and North America represented. The arrival of countries like China and India    between them    percent of the world's population    and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on  represent the most important single act of democratization in the last     years. Civilizations and cultures  which had been ignored  which had no voice  which were not listened to  which were not known about  will have a different sort of representation in this world. As humanists  we must welcome  surely  this transformation  and we will have to learn about these civilizations. This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early   th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea  the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa. The little boat in front of it was the one in which     years later  Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic. Or  look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in     . I think they're playing golf. Christ  the Chinese even invented golf. Welcome to the future. Thank you.\n",
      "G'day  my name's Kevin. I'm from Australia. I'm here to help. Tonight  I want to talk about a tale of two cities. One of those cities is called Washington  and the other is called Beijing. Because how these two capitals shape their future and the future of the United States and the future of China doesn't just affect those two countries  it affects all of us in ways  perhaps  we've never thought of  the air we breathe  the water we drink  the fish we eat  the quality of our oceans  the languages we speak in the future  the jobs we have  the political systems we choose  and  of course  the great questions of war and peace. You see that bloke  He's French. His name is Napoleon. A couple of hundred years ago  he made this extraordinary projection   China is a sleeping lion  and when she awakes  the world will shake.  Napoleon got a few things wrong  he got this one absolutely right. Because China is today not just woken up  China has stood up and China is on the march  and the question for us all is where will China go and how do we engage this giant of the   st century  You start looking at the numbers  they start to confront you in a big way. It's projected that China will become  by whichever measure    PPP  market exchange rates    the largest economy in the world over the course of the decade ahead. They're already the largest trading nation  already the largest exporting nation  already the largest manufacturing nation  and they're also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world. America comes second. So if China does become the world's largest economy  think about this  It'll be the first time since this guy was on the throne of England    George III  not a good friend of Napoleon's    that in the world we will have as the largest economy a non English speaking country  a non Western country  a non liberal democratic country. And if you don't think that's going to affect the way in which the world happens in the future  then personally  I think you've been smoking something  and it doesn't mean you're from Colorado. So in short  the question we have tonight is  how do we understand this mega change  which I believe to be the biggest change for the first half of the   st century  It'll affect so many things. It will go to the absolute core. It's happening quietly. It's happening persistently. It's happening in some senses under the radar  as we are all preoccupied with what's going in Ukraine  what's going on in the Middle East  what's going on with ISIS  what's going on with ISIL  what's happening with the future of our economies. This is a slow and quiet revolution. And with a mega change comes also a mega challenge  and the mega challenge is this  Can these two great countries  China and the United States    China  the Middle Kingdom  and the United States  M igu     which in Chinese  by the way  means  the beautiful country.  Think about that    that's the name that China has given this country for more than a hundred years. Whether these two great civilizations  these two great countries  can in fact carve out a common future for themselves and for the world  In short  can we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous  or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace  And I have    minutes to work through war or peace  which is a little less time than they gave this guy to write a book called  War and Peace.  People ask me  why is it that a kid growing up in rural Australia got interested in learning Chinese  Well  there are two reasons for that. Here's the first of them. That's Betsy the cow. Now  Betsy the cow was one of a herd of dairy cattle that I grew up with on a farm in rural Australia. See those hands there  These are not built for farming. So very early on  I discovered that in fact  working in a farm was not designed for me  and China was a very safe remove from any career in Australian farm life. Here's the second reason. That's my mom. Anyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do  Everyone ever do what their mom told them to do  I rarely did  but what my mom said to me was  one day  she handed me a newspaper  a headline which said  here we have a huge change. And that change is China entering the United Nations.       I had just turned    years of age  and she handed me this headline. And she said   Understand this   learn this  because it's going to affect your future.  So being a very good student of history  I decided that the best thing for me to do was  in fact  to go off and learn Chinese. The great thing about learning Chinese is that your Chinese teacher gives you a new name. And so they gave me this name  K   which means to overcome or to conquer  and W n  and that's the character for literature or the arts. K  W n  Conqueror of the Classics. Any of you guys called  Kevin   It's a major lift from being called Kevin to be called Conqueror of the Classics. I've been called Kevin all my life. Have you been called Kevin all your life  Would you prefer to be called Conqueror of the Classics  And so I went off after that and joined the Australian Foreign Service  but here is where pride    before pride  there always comes a fall. So there I am in the embassy in Beijing  off to the Great Hall of the People with our ambassador  who had asked me to interpret for his first meeting in the Great Hall of the People. And so there was I. If you've been to a Chinese meeting  it's a giant horseshoe. At the head of the horsehoe are the really serious pooh bahs  and down the end of the horseshoe are the not so serious pooh bahs  the junior woodchucks like me. And so the ambassador began with this inelegant phrase. He said   China and Australia are currently enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness.  And I thought to myself   That sounds clumsy. That sounds odd. I will improve it.  Note to file  Never do that. It needed to be a little more elegant  a little more classical  so I rendered it as follows.  In Chinese  There was a big pause on the other side of the room. You could see the giant pooh bahs at the head of the horseshoe  the blood visibly draining from their faces  and the junior woodchucks at the other end of the horseshoe engaged in peals of  unrestrained laughter. Because when I rendered his sentence   Australia and China are  enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness   in fact  what I said was that Australia and China were now experiencing fantastic orgasm. That was the last time I was asked to interpret. But in that little story  there's a wisdom  which is  as soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization of       years of continuing history  there's always something new to learn. History is against us when it comes to the U.S. and China forging a common future together. This guy up here  He's not Chinese and he's not American. He's Greek. His name's Thucydides. He wrote the history of the Peloponnesian Wars. And he made this extraordinary observation about Athens and Sparta.  It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable.  And hence  a whole literature about something called the Thucydides Trap. This guy here  He's not American and he's not Greek. He's Chinese. His name is Sun Tzu. He wrote  The Art of War   and if you see his statement underneath  it's along these lines   Attack him where he is unprepared  appear where you are not expected.  Not looking good so far for China and the United States. This guy is an American. His name's Graham Allison. In fact  he's a teacher at the Kennedy School over there in Boston. He's working on a single project at the moment  which is  does the Thucydides Trap about the inevitably of war between rising powers and established great powers apply to the future of China U.S. relations  It's a core question. And what Graham has done is explore    cases in history since the     s to establish what the precedents are. And in    out of    of them  let me tell you  they've ended in catastrophic war. You may say   But Kevin    or Conqueror of the Classics    that was the past. We live now in a world of interdependence and globalization. It could never happen again.  Guess what  The economic historians tell us that in fact  the time which we reached the greatest point of economic integration and globalization was in       just before that happened  World War I  a sobering reflection from history. So if we are engaged in this great question of how China thinks  feels  and positions itself towards the United States  and the reverse  how do we get to the baseline of how these two countries and civilizations can possibly work together  Let me first go to  in fact  China's views of the U.S. and the rest of the West. Number one  China feels as if it's been humiliated at the hands of the West through a hundred years of history  beginning with the Opium Wars. When after that  the Western powers carved China up into little pieces  so that by the time it got to the '  s and '  s  signs like this one appeared on the streets of Shanghai.   No dogs and Chinese allowed   How would you feel if you were Chinese  in your own country   if you saw that sign appear  China also believes and feels as if  in the events of       at the Peace Conference in Paris  when Germany's colonies were given back to all sorts of countries around in the world  what about German colonies in China  They were  in fact  given to Japan. When Japan then invaded China in the     s the world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to China. And then  on top of that  the Chinese to this day believe that the United States and the West do not accept the legitimacy of their political system because it's so radically different from those of us who come from liberal democracies  and believe that the United States to this day is seeking to undermine their political system. China also believes that it is being contained by U.S. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the U.S. right around its periphery. And beyond all that  the Chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those of us in the collective West are just too damned arrogant. That is  we don't recognize the problems in our own system  in our politics and our economics  and are very quick to point the finger elsewhere  and believe that  in fact  we in the collective West are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy. Of course  in international relations  it's not just the sound of one hand clapping. There's another country too  and that's called the U.S. So how does the U.S. respond to all of the above  The U.S. has a response to each of those. On the question of is the U.S. containing China  they say   No  look at the history of the Soviet Union. That was containment.  Instead  what we have done in the U.S. and the West is welcome China into the global economy  and on top of that  welcome them into the World Trade Organization. The U.S. and the West say China cheats on the question of intellectual property rights  and through cyberattacks on U.S. and global firms. Furthermore  the United States says that the Chinese political system is fundamentally wrong because it's at such fundamental variance to the human rights  democracy  and rule of law that we enjoy in the U.S. and the collective West. And on top of all the above  what does the United States say  That they fear that China will  when it has sufficient power  establish a sphere of influence in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia  boot the United States out  and in time  when it's powerful enough  unilaterally seek to change the rules of the global order. So apart from all of that  it's just fine and dandy  the U.S. China relationship. No real problems there. The challenge  though  is given those deep rooted feelings  those deep rooted emotions and thought patterns  what the Chinese call  S w i   ways of thinking  how can we craft a basis for a common future between these two  I argue simply this  We can do it on the basis on a framework of constructive realism for a common purpose. What do I mean by that  Be realistic about the things that we disagree on  and a management approach that doesn't enable any one of those differences to break into war or conflict until we've acquired the diplomatic skills to solve them. Be constructive in areas of the bilateral  regional and global engagement between the two  which will make a difference for all of humankind. Build a regional institution capable of cooperation in Asia  an Asia Pacific community. And worldwide  act further  like you've begun to do at the end of last year by striking out against climate change with hands joined together rather than fists apart. Of course  all that happens if you've got a common mechanism and political will to achieve the above. These things are deliverable. But the question is  are they deliverable alone  This is what our head tells us we need to do  but what about our heart  I have a little experience in the question back home of how you try to bring together two peoples who  frankly  haven't had a whole lot in common in the past. And that's when I apologized to Australia's indigenous peoples. This was a day of reckoning in the Australian government  the Australian parliament  and for the Australian people. After     years of unbridled abuse towards the first Australians  it was high time that we white folks said we were sorry. The important thing    The important thing that I remember is staring in the faces of all those from Aboriginal Australia as they came to listen to this apology. It was extraordinary to see  for example  old women telling me the stories of when they were five years old and literally ripped away from their parents  like this lady here. It was extraordinary for me to then be able to embrace and to kiss Aboriginal elders as they came into the parliament building  and one woman said to me  it's the first time a white fella had ever kissed her in her life  and she was over   . That's a terrible story. And then I remember this family saying to me   You know  we drove all the way from the far North down to Canberra to come to this thing  drove our way through redneck country. On the way back  stopped at a cafe after the apology for a milkshake.  And they walked into this cafe quietly  tentatively  gingerly  a little anxious. I think you know what I'm talking about. But the day after the apology  what happened  Everyone in that cafe  every one of the white folks  stood up and applauded. Something had happened in the hearts of these people in Australia. The white folks  our Aboriginal brothers and sisters  and we haven't solved all these problems together  but let me tell you  there was a new beginning because we had gone not just to the head  we'd gone also to the heart. So where does that conclude in terms of the great question that we've been asked to address this evening  which is the future of U.S. China relations  The head says there's a way forward. The head says there is a policy framework  there's a common narrative  there's a mechanism through regular summitry to do these things and to make them better. But the heart must also find a way to reimagine the possibilities of the America China relationship  and the possibilities of China's future engagement in the world. Sometimes  folks  we just need to take a leap of faith not quite knowing where we might land. In China  they now talk about the Chinese Dream. In America  we're all familiar with the term  the American Dream.  I think it's time  across the world  that we're able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind. Because if we do that  we might just change the way that we think about each other.  In Chinese  That's my challenge to America. That's my challenge to China. That's my challenge to all of us  but I think where there's a will and where there is imagination we can turn this into a future driven by peace and prosperity and not once again repeat the tragedies of war. I thank you. Chris Anderson  Thanks so much for that. Thanks so much for that. It feels like you yourself have a role to play in this bridging. You  in a way  are uniquely placed to speak to both sides. Kevin Rudd  Well  what we Australians do best is organize the drinks  so you get them together in one room  and we suggest this and suggest that  then we go and get the drinks. But no  look  for all of us who are friends of these two great countries  America and China  you can do something. You can make a practical contribution  and for all you good folks here  next time you meet someone from China  sit down and have a conversation. See what you can find out about where they come from and what they think  and my challenge for all the Chinese folks who are going to watch this TED Talk at some time is do the same. Two of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference. Those of us up the middle  we can make a small contribution. CA  Kevin  all power to you  my friend. Thank you. KR  Thank you. Thank you  folks.\n",
      "There are more Chinese restaurants in this country than McDonald's  Burger King  Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's  combined            actually. Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history  as a matter of fact. The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant called Yenching Palace in Washington  D.C.  which unfortunately is closed now  and about to be turned into Walgreen's. And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll  on H Street in Washington. And it's not completely gratuitous  because wok and roll    Chinese food and Japanese foods  so it kind of works out. And Americans love their Chinese food so much they've actually brought it into space. NASA  for example  serves thermal stabilized sweet and sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts. So  let me present the question to you  If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie  you should ask yourself  how often do you eat apple pie  versus how often do you eat Chinese food. Right  And if you think about it  a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or Americans think of as Chinese food are barely recognizable to Chinese  for example  beef with broccoli  egg rolls  General Tso's Chicken  fortune cookies  chop suey  the take out boxes. For example  I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China  gave them to Chinese to see how they would react. What is this  Should I try it  Try it  What is it called  Fortune cookie. There's a piece of paper inside  What is this  You've won a prize  What is this  It's a fortune  Tasty  So  where are they from  The short answer is  actually  they're from Japan. And in Kyoto  outside  there are still small family run bakeries that make fortune cookies  as they did over     years ago     years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States. If you see them side by side  there's yellow and brown. Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste  so they're not as sweet as our version. So  how did they get to the United States  Well  the short answer is  the Japanese immigrants came over  and a bunch of the bakers introduced them    including at least one in Los Angeles  and one here in San Francisco called Benkyo do  which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan. They back then  actually  made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in Kyoto. So  the interesting question is  how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese to being something that is Chinese  Well  the short answer is  we locked up all the Japanese during World War II  including those that made fortune cookies  so that's the time when the Chinese moved in  kind of saw a market opportunity and took over. So  fortune cookies  invented by the Japanese  popularized by the Chinese  but ultimately consumed by Americans. They are more American than anything else. Another one of my favorite dishes  General Tso's Chicken    which  by the way  in the US Naval Academy is called Admiral Tso's Chicken. I love this dish. The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso  and he has marched very far indeed  because he is sweet  he is fried  and he is chicken    all things that Americans love. He has marched so far  actually  that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn't recognize it  he's kind of horrified. He's in Taiwan right now. He's retired  deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong. So  he    after this I showed him  he got up  and he's like   Mominqimiao   which means   This is all nonsense   and goes back to play his Mahjong game during the afternoon. So  another dish. One of my favorites. Beef with broccoli. Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable  in fact  it is originally an Italian vegetable. It was introduced into the United States in the     s  but became popularized in the     s and the     s. In fact  the Chinese had their own version of broccoli  which is called Chinese broccoli  but right now  what    they've now discovered American broccoli  and are importing it as a  sort of  exotic delicacy. I guarantee you  General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life    and indeed  that actually was a picture of General Tso. I went to his home town. This is a billboard that says   Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso.  And I went looking for chicken. Finally found a cow    and did find chicken. Believe it or not  these guys were actually crossing the road. And       I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who are still in the little town. This guy is now five generations removed from the General  this guy is about seven. Showed them all the pictures of General Tso Chicken that I showed you  and they're like  we don't know this dish. And then they're like  is this Chinese food  Because it doesn't look like Chinese food to them. But they weren't kind of surprised I traveled around the world to visit them  because in their eyes he is  after all  a famous Qing dynasty military hero. He played an important role in the Taiping rebellion  which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God and the baby brother of Jesus Christ. And caused the war that killed    million people    still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day. So  you know  I realized when I was there  General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America  in that he's known for chicken and not war. But in China  this guy's actually known for war and not chicken. But the granddaddy of all the Chinese American dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey  which was introduced around the turn of the   th century. And according to New York Times  in       there was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town  and  the city has gone 'chop suey' mad.  So it took about    years before the Americans realized that  whoa  chop suey is actually not known in China. And as this article points out   The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey.  You know  back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan  if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl  you could take her out on a chop suey date. I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another  because chop suey  if you translate into Chinese  means tsap sui  which  if you translate back  means  odds and ends.  So  these people are going around China asking for chop suey  which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying  I understand you have a very popular dish in your country called  leftovers   and it is particularly       right  And not only that  this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call Thanksgiving. So  why    why and where    did chop suey come from  Let's go back to mid     s when the Chinese first came to America. Now back then  the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food. In fact  they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien. These people weren't eating dogs    they were eating cats    and they weren't eating cats    they were eating rats. In fact  The New York Times  my esteemed employer  in      ran an article that asked   Do Chinese eat rats   And not the most PC question to be asked today  but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time  not so outlandish. This is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late     s  and if you see  under the word  Clears     very small    it says   They must go   which refers not only to the rats  but to the Chinese in their midst  because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us. And another way that you saw  sort of  this sort of  this antipathy towards the Chinese is through documents like this. This is actually in the Library of Congress  it is a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers  hero of our American labor movement  and it's called   Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion  Meat versus Rice  American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism  Which shall survive  And it basically made the argument that Chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for American men who ate meat. And as a matter of fact  then  this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country So  with sentiments like these  the Chinese Exclusion Act was sort of passed between      and       the only time in American history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity. So  in a way  because the Chinese were attacked  chop suey was created as a defense mechanism. Now  who came up with the idea of chop suey  There's a lot of different mysteries  a lot of different legends  but of the ones that I've found that I thought was most interesting is this article from     . A Chinese guy named Lem Sen shows up in Chinatown  New York City  and says  I want you guys all to stop making chop suey  because I am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey. And the way that he tells it  there was a guy  there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up  and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could  quote   pass  as Chinese. And as he said    we would never print this today    but basically  the American man has become very rich. Lem Sen  who's this guy  I would have made this money  too  but I've spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe. Now I've come and found him  and I want my recipe back and I want everyone to stop making chop suey  or pay me for the right to do the same. So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights. So the thing is  this kind of idea of Chinese American food doesn't exist only in America. In fact  if you think about it  Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet  served on all seven continents  even Antarctica  because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station  which is the main scientific station in Antarctica. So  you see different varieties of Chinese food. For example  there is French Chinese food  where they serve salt and pepper frog legs. There is Italian Chinese food  where they don't have fortune cookies  so they serve fried gelato. My downstairs neighbor  Alessandra  was completely shocked when I told her   Dude  fried gelato is not Chinese.  She's like   It's not  But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy.  And even the Brits have their own version. This is a dish called crispy shredded beef  which has a lot of crisp  a lot of shred  and not a lot of beef. There is West Indian Chinese food  there's Jamaican Chinese food  there is Middle Eastern Chinese food  there's Mauritian Chinese food. This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered. There's Indian Chinese food  Korean Chinese food  Japanese Chinese food  where they take the bao  the little buns  and they make them into pizza versions  and they take    and they    like  totally randomly they'll take Chinese noodle dishes  and they'll just Ramen ize them. This is  like  this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup. So  there's Peruvian Chinese food  which should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food  where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas. And then    one thing  they have things like risotto chop suey. My personal favorite of all the restaurants I've encountered around the world was this one in Brazil  called  Kung Food.  So  let's take a step back  and kind of  understand what is to be appreciated in America. McDonald's has  sort of  garnered a lot of attention  a lot of respect  for basically standardizing the menu  d cor and dining experience in post World War II America. But you know what  They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois  right  Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing  I would argue  with the menu and the d cor    even the restaurant name    but without a centralized headquarters. So  this actually became very clear to me with the March          Powerball drawing  where  you know  they expected  based on the number of ticket sales they had  to have three or four second place winners    those are the people who match five or six Powerball numbers. Instead  they had      and they were completely shocked. They looked all across the country  and discovered it couldn't necessarily be fraud  because it happened  you know  in different states  across different computer systems. So whatever it was  it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way. So  like  OK  maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper    you know  like  it was a diamond  or  you know  diagonal. It wasn't that. It wasn't that  so they're like  OK  let's look at television  so they looked at an episode of  Lost.  Now  I don't have a TV  which makes me a freak  but very productive  and       and this episode of  Lost   I understand  where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number  which was how long they'd been on the island  but they looked  and the numbers did not match. So they looked at  The Young and The Restless   and it wasn't that  either. So  it wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day  and they ask him   Where did you get your number from   He's like   Oh  I got it from a fortune cookie.  This actually is a slip that one of the winners had  because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like  oh  no    like  this can't be true. But it was true  and basically  of those     people  and     of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie. Yeah. So  I went and started looking. I went across the country  looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from. You know  there are a bunch of them  including Lee's China in Omaha    which is actually run by Koreans  but that's another point    and a bunch of them named China Buffet. So  what's interesting is that their stories were similar  but they were different. It was lunch  it was take out  it was sit down  it was buffet  it was three weeks ago  it was three months ago. But at some point  all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a Chinese restaurant  and all these Chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies  which  of course we know aren't even Chinese to begin with. So it's kind of part of the phenomenon I called spontaneous self organization  right  where  like in ant colonies  where little decisions made by    on the micro level actually have a big impact on the macro level. So  a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets. McDonald's actually spent    years coming out with a chicken like product. They did chicken pot pie  they did fried chicken  and then they finally introduced Chicken McNuggets. And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggetfying them  because that's kind of an easy concept  but the trick behind Chicken McNuggets was  they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost effective manner  which is why it took so long for other people to copy them. It took    years  and then within a couple of months  it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of McDonald's in the country. In contrast  we have General Tso's Chicken  which actually started in New York City in the early     s  as I was also starting in the university in New York City in the early     s  so ... And this logo  So me  General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmacally related. But that dish also took about    years to spread across America from a random restaurant in New York City. Someone's like  oh  God    it's sweet  it's fried  it's chicken  Americans will love this. So  what I like to say  you know  this being sort of Bay Area  Silicon Valley    is that we think of McDonald's as sort of the Microsoft of the dining experiences. We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux  sort of an open source thing  right  where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system  that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food  you know  depending on the region. For example  you know  in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food  where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish  right  And in Philadelphia  you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll  which looks like an egg roll on the outside  but a cheesesteak on the inside. I was really surprised to discover that  not only in Philadelphia  but also in Atlanta  because what had happened was that a Chinese family had moved from Atlanta to    sorry  from Philadelphia to Atlanta  and brought that with them. So  the thing is  our historical lore  because of the way we like narratives  are full of vast characters such as  you know  Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald's and Asa Chandler with Coca Cola. But  you know  it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters    oops    for example  like Lem Sen  who introduced chop suey  Chef Peng  who introduced General Tso Chicken  and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies. So  the point of my presentation is to make you think twice  that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much  if not more  impact on what we eat today. So. Thank you very much.\n",
      "If you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the Vermont State House where I was a lobbyist in training and asked me what I was going to do with my life  I would have told you that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi  the Chinese equivalency exam  and I was going to go study law in Beijing  and I was going to improve U.S. China relations through top down policy changes and judicial system reforms. I had a plan  and I never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo. Little did I know what a huge impact it would have on me one night when I was at a party and I heard a sound coming out of a record player in the corner of a room. And it was Doc Watson singing and playing  Shady Grove.    Shady Grove  my little love     Shady Grove  my darlin'     Shady Grove  my little love     Going back to Harlan   That sound was just so beautiful  the sound of Doc's voice and the rippling groove of the banjo. And after being totally and completely obsessed with the mammoth richness and history of Chinese culture  it was like this total relief to hear something so truly American and so truly awesome. I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China. So before going to law school in China I bought a banjo  I threw it in my little red truck and I traveled down through Appalachia and I learned a bunch of old American songs  and I ended up in Kentucky at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention. And I was sitting in a hallway one night and a couple girls came up to me. And they said   Hey  do you want to jam   And I was like   Sure.  So I picked up my banjo and I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them. And a record executive walked up to me and invited me to Nashville  Tennessee to make a record. It's been eight years  and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer. In fact  I went to Nashville. And after a few months I was writing songs. And the first song I wrote was in English  and the second one was in Chinese.  Chinese  Outside your door the world is waiting. Inside your heart a voice is calling. The four corners of the world are watching  so travel daughter  travel. Go get it  girl. It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky. And I've played thousands of shows. And I've collaborated with so many incredible  inspirational musicians around the world. And I see the power of music. I see the power of music to connect cultures. I see it when I stand on a stage in a bluegrass festival in east Virginia and I look out at the sea of lawn chairs and I bust out into a song in Chinese.  Chinese  And everybody's eyes just pop wide open like it's going to fall out of their heads. And they're like   What's that girl doing   And then they come up to me after the show and they all have a story. They all come up and they're like   You know  my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to China and adopted a girl.  And I tell you what  it like everybody's got a story. It's just incredible. And then I go to China and I stand on a stage at a university and I bust out into a song in Chinese and everybody sings along and they roar with delight at this girl with the hair and the instrument  and she's singing their music. And I see  even more importantly  the power of music to connect hearts. Like the time I was in Sichuan Province and I was singing for kids in relocation schools in the earthquake disaster zone. And this little girl comes up to me.  Chinese   Big sister Wong   Washburn  Wong  same difference.  Big sister Wong  can I sing you a song that my mom sang for me before she was swallowed in the earthquake   And I sat down  she sat on my lap. She started singing her song. And the warmth of her body and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks  and I started to cry. And the light that shone off of her eyes was a place I could have stayed forever. And in that moment  we weren't our American selves  we weren't our Chinese selves  we were just mortals sitting together in that light that keeps us here. I want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone. And I know U.S. China relations doesn't need another lawyer. Thank you.\n",

      "The job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when I was    years old. I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex. And I started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way. I went to my school kitchen  and I said   Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at.  I went to the local baker and took their stale bread. I went to the local greengrocer  and I went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets. This was great. My pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork. I sold that pork to my school friends' parents  and I made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance. But I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption  and that I was only scratching the surface  and that right the way up the food supply chain  in supermarkets  greengrocers  bakers  in our homes  in factories and farms  we were hemorrhaging out food. Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting. I'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites  and I thought  surely there is something more sensible to do with food than waste it. One morning  when I was feeding my pigs  I noticed a particularly tasty looking sun dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time. I grabbed hold of it  sat down  and ate my breakfast with my pigs.  Laughter  That was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism  really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste  and the provision of the solution to food waste  which is simply to sit down and eat food  rather than throwing it away. That became  as it were  a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food  and exposing  most importantly  to the public  that when we're talking about food being thrown away  we're not talking about rotten stuff  we're not talking about stuff that's beyond the pale. We're talking about good  fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale. Eventually  I set about writing my book  really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale. What this shows is a nation by nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world. Unfortunately  empirical data  good  hard stats  don't exist  and therefore to prove my point  I first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted. So I took the food supply of every single country and I compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country. That's based on diet intake surveys  it's based on levels of obesity  it's based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people's mouths. That black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste. There will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic that I think we can live in a waste free world. But that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good  stable  secure  nutritional diet for every person in that country. Any dot above that line  and you'll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world  represents unnecessary surplus  and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country. As a country gets richer  it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants  and as you can see  most European and North American countries fall between     and     percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations. So a country like America has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the American people. But the thing that really struck me  when I plotted all this data  and it was a lot of numbers  was that you can see how it levels off. Countries rapidly shoot towards that     mark  and then they level off  and they don't really go on rising as you might expect. So I decided to unpack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or false. And that's what I came up with. If you include not just the food that ends up in shops and restaurants  but also the food that people feed to livestock  the maize  the soy  the wheat  that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products  what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times the amount of food that their population needs to feed itself. A country like America has four times the amount of food that it needs. When people talk about the need to increase global food production to feed those nine billion people that are expected on the planet by       I always think of these graphs. The fact is  we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger. We've never had such gargantuan surpluses before. In many ways  this is a great success story of human civilization  of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve        years ago. It is a success story. It has been a success story. But what we have to recognize now is that we are reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear  and when we chop down forests  as we are every day  to grow more and more food  when we extract water from depleting water reserves  when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest to grow more and more food  and then we throw away so much of it  we have to think about what we can start saving. And yesterday  I went to one of the local supermarkets that I often visit to inspect  if you like  what they're throwing away. I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there. And I thought  well this could serve as a symbol for today. So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that I found in the bin represent the global food supply  okay  We start out with nine. That's what's in fields around the world every single year. The first biscuit we're going to lose before we even leave the farm. That's a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture  whether it's a lack of infrastructure  refrigeration  pasteurization  grain stores  even basic fruit crates  which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields. The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock  the maize  the wheat and the soya. Unfortunately  our beasts are inefficient animals  and they turn two thirds of that into feces and heat  so we've lost those two  and we've only kept this one in meat and dairy products. Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins. This is what most of us think of when we think of food waste  what ends up in the garbage  what ends up in supermarket bins  what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two  and we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on. That is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources  especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world. Having gone through the data  I then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up. Where does it end up  We're used to seeing the stuff on our plates  but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between  Supermarkets are an easy place to start. This is the result of my hobby  which is unofficial bin inspections.  Laughter  Strange you might think  but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores  we wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back  opening up bins and having a look at what's inside. But this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in Britain  in Europe  in North America. It represents a colossal waste of food  but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg. When you start going up the supply chain  you find where the real food waste is happening on a gargantuan scale. Can I have a show of hands if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house  Who lives in a household where that crust    that slice at the first and last end of each loaf    who lives in a household where it does get eaten  Okay  most people  not everyone  but most people  and this is  I'm glad to say  what I see across the world  and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it   Laughter  I certainly haven't. So I kept on thinking  where do those crusts go   Laughter  This is the answer  unfortunately         slices of fresh bread coming out of this one single factory every single day  day fresh bread. In the same year that I visited this factory  I went to Pakistan  where people in      were going hungry as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies. We contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in Britain and elsewhere in the world. We take food off the market shelves that hungry people depend on. Go one step up  and you get to farmers  who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards. This farmer  for example  has invested        pounds in growing spinach  not one leaf of which he harvested  because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it. Potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect  all going for pigs. Parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications  tomatoes in Tenerife  oranges in Florida  bananas in Ecuador  where I visited last year  all being discarded. This is one day's waste from one banana plantation in Ecuador. All being discarded  perfectly edible  because they're the wrong shape or size. If we do that to fruit and vegetables  you bet we can do it to animals too. Liver  lungs  heads  tails  kidneys  testicles  all of these things which are traditional  delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste. Offal consumption has halved in Britain and America in the last    years. As a result  this stuff gets fed to dogs at best  or is incinerated. This man  in Kashgar  Xinjiang province  in Western China  is serving up his national dish. It's called sheep's organs. It's delicious  it's nutritious  and as I learned when I went to Kashgar  it symbolizes their taboo against food waste. I was sitting in a roadside cafe. A chef came to talk to me  I finished my bowl  and halfway through the conversation  he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl. I thought   My goodness  what taboo have I broken  How have I insulted my host   He pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl  and he said   Clean.   Laughter  I thought   My God  you know  I go around the world telling people to stop wasting food. This guy has thrashed me at my own game.   Laughter  But it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we  the people  do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food on a colossal scale  if we make noise about it  tell corporations about it  tell governments we want to see an end to food waste  we do have the power to bring about that change. Fish     to    percent of European fish are discarded at sea  they don't even get landed. In our homes  we've lost touch with food. This is an experiment I did on three lettuces. Who keeps lettuces in their fridge  Most people. The one on the left was kept in a fridge for    days. The one in the middle  on my kitchen table. Not much difference. The one on the right I treated like cut flowers. It's a living organism  cut the slice off  stuck it in a vase of water  it was all right for another two weeks after this. Some food waste  as I said at the beginning  will inevitably arise  so the question is  what is the best thing to do with it  I answered that question when I was   . In fact  humans answered that question       years ago  We domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food. And yet  in Europe  that practice has become illegal since      as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak. It's unscientific. It's unnecessary. If you cook food for pigs  just as if you cook food for humans  it is rendered safe. It's also a massive saving of resources. At the moment  Europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from South America  where its production contributes to global warming  to deforestation  to biodiversity loss  to feed livestock here in Europe. At the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them. If we did that  and fed it to pigs  we would save that amount of carbon. If we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste  to anaerobic digestion  which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity  you save a paltry     kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs. We knew that during the war.  Laughter  A silver lining  It has kicked off globally  the quest to tackle food waste. Feeding the       is an event I first organized in     . We fed       people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted. Since then  it's happened again in London  it's happening internationally  and across the country. It's a way of organizations coming together to celebrate food  to say the best thing to do with food is to eat and enjoy it  and to stop wasting it. For the sake of the planet we live on  for the sake of our children  for the sake of all the other organisms that share our planet with us  we are a terrestrial animal  and we depend on our land for food. At the moment  we are trashing our land to grow food that no one eats. Stop wasting food. Thank you very much.  Applause \n",
      "I write about food. I write about cooking. I take it quite seriously  but I'm here to talk about something that's become very important to me in the last year or two. It is about food  but it's not about cooking  per se. I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow. I'm not a vegetarian    this is the old Nixon line  right  But I still think that this       may be this year's version of this. Now  that is only a little bit hyperbolic. And why do I say it  Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined. There was the bomb  and there's now. And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives  but whether  if we could see the Earth a century from now  we'd recognize it. It's a holocaust of a different kind  and hiding under our desks isn't going to help. Start with the notion that global warming is not only real  but dangerous. Since every scientist in the world now believes this  and even President Bush has seen the light  or pretends to  we can take this is a given. Then hear this  please. After energy production  livestock is the second highest contributor to atmosphere altering gases. Nearly one fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production    more than transportation. Now  you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts  but methane is    times more poisonous than CO   and it's not just methane. Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation  air and water pollution  water shortages and loss of biodiversity. There's more. Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people  but to animals. But lists like this become kind of numbing  so let me just say this  if you're a progressive  if you're driving a Prius  or you're shopping green  or you're looking for organic  you should probably be a semi vegetarian. Now  I'm no more anti cattle than I am anti atom  but it's all in the way we use these things. There's another piece of the puzzle  which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday  and one you already know. There's no question  none  that so called lifestyle diseases    diabetes  heart disease  stroke  some cancers    are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world. And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet. Our demand for meat  dairy and refined carbohydrates    the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day    our demand for these things  not our need  our want  drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us. And those calories are in foods that cause  not prevent  disease. Now global warming was unforeseen. We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility. Maybe a few lung diseases here and there  but  you know  that's not such a big deal. The current health crisis  however  is a little more the work of the evil empire. We were told  we were assured  that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate  the healthier we'd be. No. Overconsumption of animals  and of course  junk food  is the problem  along with our paltry consumption of plants. Now  there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here  but the evidence is that plants    and I want to make this clear    it's not the ingredients in plants  it's the plants. It's not the beta carotene  it's the carrot. The evidence is very clear that plants promote health. This evidence is overwhelming at this point. You eat more plants  you eat less other stuff  you live longer. Not bad. But back to animals and junk food. What do they have in common  One  we don't need either of them for health. We don't need animal products  and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke. Two  both have been marketed heavily  creating unnatural demand. We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles. Three  their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health  and Earth friendly diet. Now  let's imagine a parallel. Let's pretend that our government supported an oil based economy  while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy  knowing all the while that the result would be pollution  war and rising costs. Incredible  isn't it  Yet they do that. And they do this here. It's the same deal. The sad thing is  when it comes to diet  is that even when well intentioned Feds try to do right by us  they fail. Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness  or they are puppets of agribusiness. So  when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants  rather than animals  that made people healthy  they encouraged us  via their overly simplistic food pyramid  to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day  along with more carbs. What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others  and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food. But industry lobbyists would never let that happen. And guess what  Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness. So  instead of substituting plants for animals  our swollen appetites simply became larger  and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged. So called low fat diets  so called low carb diets    these are not solutions. But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local  or whether we're being nice to animals  the most important issues just aren't being addressed. Now  don't get me wrong. I like animals  and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches. But there's no way to treat animals well  when you're killing    billion of them a year. That's our number.    billion. If you strung all of them    chickens  cows  pigs and lambs    to the moon  they'd go there and back five times  there and back. Now  my math's a little shaky  but this is pretty good  and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long  but you get the idea. That's just the United States. And with our hyper consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease  kindness might just be a bit of a red herring. Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down  and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left. Another red herring might be exemplified by the word  locavore   which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary. Seriously. And locavore  for those of you who don't know  is someone who eats only locally grown food    which is fine if you live in California  but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke. Between the official story    the food pyramid    and the hip locavore vision  you have two versions of how to improve our eating. They both get it wrong  though. The first at least is populist  and the second is elitist. How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States. And I'm going to go through that  at least the last hundred years or so  very quickly right now. A hundred years ago  guess what  Everyone was a locavore  even New York had pig farms nearby  and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion. Every family had a cook  usually a mom. And those moms bought and prepared food. It was like your romantic vision of Europe. Margarine didn't exist. In fact  when margarine was invented  several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink  so we'd all know that it was a fake. There was no snack food  and until the '  s  until Clarence Birdseye came along  there was no frozen food. There were no restaurant chains. There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people  but none of them would think to open another one. Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic. And fancy food was entirely French. As an aside  those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the     s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide. Back in those days  before even Julia  back in those days  there was no philosophy of food. You just ate. You didn't claim to be anything. There was no marketing. There were no national brands. Vitamins had not been invented. There were no health claims  at least not federally sanctioned ones. Fats  carbs  proteins    they weren't bad or good  they were food. You ate food. Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient  because it was an ingredient. The cornflake hadn't been invented. The Pop Tart  the Pringle  Cheez Whiz  none of that stuff. Goldfish swam. It's hard to imagine. People grew food  and they ate food. And again  everyone ate local. In New York  an orange was a common Christmas present  because it came all the way from Florida. From the '  s on  road systems expanded  trucks took the place of railroads  fresh food began to travel more. Oranges became common in New York. The South and West became agricultural hubs  and in other parts of the country  suburbs took over farmland. The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere. And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle  as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato  even in summer. Eventually  California produced too much food to ship fresh  so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods. Thus arrived convenience. It was sold to proto feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework. Now  I know everybody over the age of  like       their mouths are watering at this point. If we had a slide of Salisbury steak  even more so  right  But this may have cut down on housework  but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well. Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad. I  for one    and I'm not kidding    didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was   . Who needed it though  Meat was everywhere. What could be easier  more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak  But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally. Rather than spending their lives eating grass  for which their stomachs were designed  they were forced to eat soy and corn. They have trouble digesting those grains  of course  but that wasn't a problem for producers. New drugs kept them healthy. Well  they kept them alive. Healthy was another story. Thanks to farm subsidies  the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress  soy  corn and cattle became king. And chicken soon joined them on the throne. It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began  the thing we're only realizing just now. Listen to this  between      and       the world's population doubled. Meat consumption increased five fold. Now  someone had to eat all that stuff  so we got fast food. And this took care of the situation resoundingly. Home cooking remained the norm  but its quality was down the tubes. There were fewer meals with home cooked breads  desserts and soups  because all of them could be bought at any store. Not that they were any good  but they were there. Most moms cooked like mine  a piece of broiled meat  a quickly made salad with bottled dressing  canned soup  canned fruit salad. Maybe baked or mashed potatoes  or perhaps the stupidest food ever  Minute Rice. For dessert  store bought ice cream or cookies. My mom is not here  so I can say this now. This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself. It wasn't all bad. By the '  s  forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients. We tended gardens  we became interested in organic food  we knew or we were vegetarians. We weren't all hippies  either. Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well. Meanwhile  food production had become industrial. Industrial. Perhaps because it was being produced rationally  as if it were plastic  food gained magical or poisonous powers  or both. Many people became fat phobic. Others worshiped broccoli  as if it were God like. But mostly they didn't eat broccoli. Instead they were sold on yogurt  yogurt being almost as good as broccoli. Except  in reality  the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream. Similarly  let's look at a granola bar. You think that that might be healthy food  but in fact  if you look at the ingredient list  it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal. Sadly  it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma  if not actually killed    the beginning of the heyday of value added food  which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it. Think of the frozen chicken nugget. The chicken is fed corn  and then its meat is ground up  and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder  and then it's fried in corn oil. All you do is nuke it. What could be better  And zapped horribly  pathetically. By the '  s  home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets    and we all have our favorites  actually    made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home. At the same time  masses of women were entering the workforce  and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden. So now  you've got your pizza nights  you've got your microwave nights  you've got your grazing nights  you've got your fend for yourself nights and so on. Leading the way    what's leading the way  Meat  junk food  cheese  the very stuff that will kill you. So  now we clamor for organic food. That's good. And as evidence that things can actually change  you can now find organic food in supermarkets  and even in fast food outlets. But organic food isn't the answer either  at least not the way it's currently defined. Let me pose you a question. Can farm raised salmon be organic  when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet  even if the feed itself is supposedly organic  and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens  swimming in their own filth  And if that salmon's from Chile  and it's killed down there and then flown       miles  whatever  dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere  I don't know. Packed in Styrofoam  of course  before landing somewhere in the United States  and then being trucked a few hundred more miles. This may be organic in letter  but it's surely not organic in spirit. Now here is where we all meet. The locavores  the organivores  the vegetarians  the vegans  the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food. Even though we've come to this from different points  we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food. We need to start acting. And this is not only an issue of social justice  as Ann Cooper said    and  of course  she's completely right    but it's also one of global survival. Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue  the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food. As I said     percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production. How much livestock do you need to produce this     percent of the agricultural land on Earth     percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we'll eat. And this amount is predicted to double in the next    years or so. And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now  it's not going to be    years. There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do. And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life. The most common argument is that we need nutrients    even though we eat  on average  twice as much protein as even the industry obsessed USDA recommends. But listen  experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week. What do you think we eat per day  Half a pound. But don't we need meat to be big and strong  Isn't meat eating essential to health  Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless  sissy  liberals  Some of us might think that would be a good thing. But  no  even if we were all steroid filled football players  the answer is no. In fact  there's no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth  and many will make you much healthier than ours does. We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition  we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition  and it's killing us. To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat    percent less meat    it's not enough of a cut  but it's a start. It would seem absurd  but that's exactly what should happen  and what progressive people  forward thinking people should be doing and advocating  along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants. I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously    one might say indiscriminately    for about    years. During that time  I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything. I'll never stop eating animals  I'm sure  but I do think that for the benefit of everyone  the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly. Ann Cooper's right. The USDA is not our ally here. We have to take matters into our own hands  not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone    and that's the hard part    but by improving our own. And that happens to be quite easy. Less meat  less junk  more plants. It's a simple formula  eat food. Eat real food. We can continue to enjoy our food  and we continue to eat well  and we can eat even better. We can continue the search for the ingredients we love  and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals. We'll reduce not only calories  but our carbon footprint. We can make food more important  not less  and save ourselves by doing so. We have to choose that path. Thank you.\n",
      "Well after many years working in trade and economics  four years ago  I found myself working on the front lines of human vulnerability. And I found myself in the places where people are fighting every day to survive and can't even obtain a meal. This red cup comes from Rwanda from a child named Fabian. And I carry this around as a symbol  really  of the challenge and also the hope. Because one cup of food a day changes Fabian's life completely. But what I'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning  about a billion people on Earth    or one out of every seven    woke up and didn't even know how to fill this cup. One out of every seven people. First  I'll ask you  Why should you care  Why should we care  For most people  if they think about hunger  they don't have to go far back on their own family history    maybe in their own lives  or their parents' lives  or their grandparents' lives    to remember an experience of hunger. I rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience. Some are driven by compassion  feel it's perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity. As Gandhi said   To a hungry man  a piece of bread is the face of God.  Others worry about peace and security  stability in the world. We saw the food riots in       after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight. The destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history. One of the most fundamental acts of civilization is to ensure people can get enough food. Others think about Malthusian nightmares. Will we be able to feed a population that will be nine billion in just a few decades  This is not a negotiable thing  hunger. People have to eat. There's going to be a lot of people. This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain. But I actually came to this issue in a different way. This is a picture of me and my three children. In       I was a new mother with my first child and was holding her and feeding her when an image very similar to this came on the television. And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia. One two years earlier had killed more than a million people. But it never struck me as it did that moment  because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby  and she had no milk to nurse. And the baby's cry really penetrated me  as a mother. And I thought  there's nothing more haunting than the cry of a child that cannot be returned with food    the most fundamental expectation of every human being. And it was at that moment that I just was filled with the challenge and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem. This isn't one of those rare diseases that we don't have the solution for. We know how to fix hunger. A hundred years ago  we didn't. We actually have the technology and systems. And I was just struck that this is out of place. At our time in history  these images are out of place. Well guess what  This is last week in northern Kenya. Yet again  the face of starvation at large scale with more than nine million people wondering if they can make it to the next day. In fact  what we know now is that every    seconds we lose a child to hunger. This is more than HIV AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis combined. And we know that the issue is not just production of food. One of my mentors in life was Norman Borlaug  my hero. But today I'm going to talk about access to food  because actually this year and last year and during the      food crisis  there was enough food on Earth for everyone to have       kilocalories. So why is it that we have a billion people who can't find food  And I also want to talk about what I call our new burden of knowledge. In       Lancet compiled all the research and put forward the compelling evidence that if a child in its first thousand days    from conception to two years old    does not have adequate nutrition  the damage is irreversible. Their brains and bodies will be stunted. And here you see a brain scan of two children    one who had adequate nutrition  another  neglected and who was deeply malnourished. And we can see brain volumes up to    percent less in these children. And in this slide you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain don't form. And what we know now is this has huge impact on economies  which I'll talk about later. But also the earning potential of these children is cut in half in their lifetime due to the stunting that happens in early years. So this burden of knowledge drives me. Because actually we know how to fix it very simply. And yet  in many places  a third of the children  by the time they're three already are facing a life of hardship due to this. I'd like to talk about some of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger  some of the things I've learned in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector. I'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is. Well first  I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth  breastfeeding. You may be surprised to know that a child could be saved every    seconds if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life. But in Niger  for example  less than seven percent of the children are breastfed for the first six months of life  exclusively. In Mauritania  less than three percent. This is something that can be transformed with knowledge. This message  this word  can come out that this is not an old fashioned way of doing business  it's a brilliant way of saving your child's life. And so today we focus on not just passing out food  but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment  and teaching them about breastfeeding. The second thing I'd like to talk about  If you were living in a remote village somewhere  your child was limp  and you were in a drought  or you were in floods  or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet  what would you do  Do you think you could go to the store and get a choice of power bars  like we can  and pick the right one to match  Well I find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count. And I go to those shops  if there are any  or out to the fields to see what they can get  and they cannot obtain the nutrition. Even if they know what they need to do  it's not available. And I'm very excited about this  because one thing we're working on is transforming the technologies that are very available in the food industry to be available for traditional crops. And this is made with chickpeas  dried milk and a host of vitamins  matched to exactly what the brain needs. It costs    cents for us to produce this as  what I call  food for humanity. We did this with food technologists in India and Pakistan    really about three of them. But this is transforming    percent of the kids who get this. One package     cents a day    their malnutrition is overcome. So I am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods. And this is climate proof. It doesn't need to be refrigerated  it doesn't need water  which is often lacking. And these types of technologies  I see  have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutrition  malnutrition out on the front lines. The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding. Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net. When disaster strikes    the economy gets blown  people lose a job  floods  war  conflict  bad governance  all of those things    there is nothing to fall back on. And usually the institutions    churches  temples  other things    do not have the resources to provide a safety net. What we have found working with the World Bank is that the poor man's safety net  the best investment  is school feeding. And if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers  you have a transformative effect. Many kids in the world can't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal. But when that food is there  it's transformative. It costs less than    cents a day to change a kid's life. But what is most amazing is the effect on girls. In countries where girls don't go to school and you offer a meal to girls in school  we see enrollment rates about    percent girls and boys. We see a transformation in attendance by girls. And there was no argument  because it's incentive. Families need the help. And we find that if we keep girls in school later  they'll stay in school until they're     and won't get married if there's food in school. Or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week    it costs about    cents    will keep a girl in school  and they'll give birth to a healthier child  because the malnutrition is sent generation to generation. We know that there's boom and bust cycles of hunger. We know this. Right now on the Horn of Africa  we've been through this before. So is this a hopeless cause  Absolutely not. I'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope. Cameroon  northern Cameroon  boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades. Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons. Well two years ago  we decided  let's transform the model of fighting hunger  and instead of giving out the food aid  we put it into food banks. And we said  listen  during the lean season  take the food out. You manage  the village manages these warehouses. And during harvest  put it back with interest  food interest. So add in five percent     percent more food. For the past two years      of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid    they're self sufficient. And the food banks are growing. And they're starting school feeding programs for their children by the people in the village. But they've never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources. I love this idea that came from the village level  three keys to unlock that warehouse. Food is gold there. And simple ideas can transform the face  not of small areas  of big areas of the world. I'd like to talk about what I call digital food. Technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine. Amartya Sen won his Nobel Prize for saying   Guess what  famines happen in the presence of food because people have no ability to buy it.  We certainly saw that in     . We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa where food prices are up     percent in some areas over last year. Food can be there and people can't buy it. Well this picture    I was in Hebron in a small shop  this shop  where instead of bringing in food  we provide digital food  a card. It says  bon appetit  in Arabic. And the women can go in and swipe and get nine food items. They have to be nutritious  and they have to be locally produced. And what's happened in the past year alone is the dairy industry    where this card's used for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus    the dairy industry has gone up    percent. The shopkeepers are hiring more people. It is a win win win situation that starts the food economy moving. We now deliver food in over    countries over cell phones  transforming even the presence of refugees in countries  and other ways. Perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that Bill Gates  Howard Buffett and others have supported boldly  which is to ask the question  What if  instead of looking at the hungry as victims    and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families    what if we view them as the solution  as the value chain to fight hunger  What if from the women in Africa who cannot sell any food    there's no roads  there's no warehouses  there's not even a tarp to pick the food up with    what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children elsewhere  And Purchasing for Progress today is in    countries. And guess what  In virtually every case  when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market    if you say   We will buy     metric tons of this. We'll pick it up. We'll make sure it's stored properly.     their yields have gone up two   three   fourfold and they figure it out  because it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life. And we're seeing people transform their lives. Today  food aid  our food aid    huge engine       percent of it is bought in the developing world. Total transformation that can actually transform the very lives that need the food. Now you'd ask  can this be done at scale  These are great ideas  village level ideas. Well I'd like to talk about Brazil  because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years  when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on Earth right now. And what I've found is  rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things  they invested in a school feeding program. And they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity. And they're doing this at huge scale after President Lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day. And this zero hunger program costs .  percent of GDP and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty. It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil  and it's at scale  and it's creating opportunities. I've gone out there  I've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this. Now if we look at the economic imperative here  this isn't just about compassion. The fact is studies show that the cost of malnutrition and hunger    the cost to society  the burden it has to bear    is on average six percent  and in some countries up to    percent  of GDP a year. And if you look at the    countries with the highest burden of malnutrition  that's     billion lost from a productive economy every year. Well  the World Bank estimates it would take about    billion dollars      .     to address malnutrition in those countries. You look at the cost benefit analysis  and my dream is to take this issue  not just from the compassion argument  but to the finance ministers of the world  and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate  affordable nutrition for all of humanity. The amazing thing I've found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader. When a leader says   Not under my watch   everything begins to change. And the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this. And the fact that France has put food at the center of the G   is really important. Because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person  nation by nation. We have to stand together. And we're seeing nations in Africa. WFP's been able to leave    nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations. What I would like to offer here is a challenge. I believe we're living at a time in human history where it's just simply unacceptable that children wake up and don't know where to find a cup of food. Not only that  transforming hunger is an opportunity  but I think we have to change our mindsets. I am so honored to be here with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers. And I would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say   No more. No more are we going to accept this.  And we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted  but that exists no more. Thank you.\n",
      "How do you feed a city  It's one of the great questions of our time. Yet it's one that's rarely asked. We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant  or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time  there is going to be food there waiting for us  having magically come from somewhere. But when you think that every day for a city the size of London  enough food has to be produced  transported  bought and sold  cooked  eaten  disposed of  and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth  it's remarkable that cities get fed at all. We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world  forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat  we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were. And as more of us move into cities  more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me    it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil    in order to feed us. These are extraordinary landscapes  but few of us ever get to see them. And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either. As more of us move into cities  more of us are eating meat  so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals. And given that it takes three times as much grain    actually ten times as much grain    to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first  that's not a very efficient way of feeding us. And it's an escalating problem too. By       it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities. And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed. So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand. And that's going to pose an enormous problem. Six billion hungry carnivores to feed  by     . That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are  it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve. Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land. Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion. We're very hungry for fossil fuels too. It takes about    calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West. And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost  we don't actually value it. Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away. And to end all of this  at the end of this long process  we're not even managing to feed the planet properly. A billion of us are obese  while a further billion starve. None of it makes very much sense. And when you think that    percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations  it's a grim picture. As we're moving into cities  the world is also embracing a Western diet. And if we look to the future  it's an unsustainable diet. So how did we get here  And more importantly  what are we going to do about it  Well  to answer the slightly easier question first  about        years ago  I would say  is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East  known as the Fertile Crescent. Because  as you can see  it was crescent shaped. And it was also fertile. And it was here  about        years ago  that two extraordinary inventions  agriculture and urbanism  happened roughly in the same place and at the same time. This is no accident  because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other. Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements. And if we look at what those settlements were like  we see they were compact. They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur  that were  in fact  effectively  spiritualized  central food distribution centers. Because it was the temples that organized the harvest  gathered in the grain  offered it to the gods  and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people. So  if you like  the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them. And in fact  that's true of every ancient city. But of course not all of them were that small. Famously  Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D. So how did a city like this feed itself  The answer is what I call  ancient food miles.  Basically  Rome had access to the sea  which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away. This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world  because it was very difficult to transport food over roads  which were rough. And the food obviously went off very quickly. So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves. And  in fact  you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long  drawn out militarized shopping spree  really. In fact    I love the fact  I just have to mention this  Rome in fact used to import oysters from London  at one stage. I think that's extraordinary. So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite. But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre industrial world. If we look at a map of London in the   th century  we can see that its grain  which is coming in from the Thames  along the bottom of this map. So the grain markets were to the south of the city. And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside  which was the main market  were also grain markets. And if you look at the name of one of those streets  Bread Street  you can tell what was going on there     years ago. And the same of course was true for fish. Fish was  of course  coming in by river as well. Same thing. And of course Billingsgate  famously  was London's fish market  operating on site here until the mid     s. Which is extraordinary  really  when you think about it. Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port. This is another thing about food in cities  Once its roots into the city are established  they very rarely move. Meat is a very different story because  of course  animals could walk into the city. So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest  from Scotland and Wales. So it was coming in  and arriving at the city at the northwest  which is why Smithfield  London's very famous meat market  was located up there. Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on  to the northeast. I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway  and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes. And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside  that's where they were sold  which is why it's called Poultry. And  in fact  if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age  you can trace food coming in to it. You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food  both by reading the names of the streets  which give you a lot of clues. Friday Street  in a previous life  is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday. But also you have to imagine it full of food. Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold. And if we look at an image of Smithfield in      you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from. In fact  if you were having Sunday lunch  the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier. So this was obviously an organic city  part of an organic cycle. And then    years later everything changed. This is an image of the Great Western in     . And as you can see  some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep. So all of a sudden  these animals are no longer walking into market. They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind  somewhere in the countryside. And they're coming into the city by rail. And this changes everything. To start off with  it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities  really any size and shape  in any place. Cities used to be constrained by geography  they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means. All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography. And as you can see from these maps of London  in the    years after the trains came  it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot  and so on  to a large splurge  that would be very  very difficult to feed with anybody on foot  either animals or people. And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars  and really this marks the end of this process. It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all. And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell  devoid of mess  certainly devoid of people  because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape. In fact  what they did to get food was they got in their cars  drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts  came back with a week's worth of shopping  and wondered what on earth to do with it. And this really is the moment when our relationship  both with food and cities  changes completely. Here we have food    that used to be the center  the social core of the city    at the periphery. It used to be a social event  buying and selling food. Now it's anonymous. We used to cook  now we just add water  or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something. We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat. We just read the back of a label on a packet. And we don't value food. We don't trust it. So instead of trusting it  we fear it. And instead of valuing it  we throw it away. One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder. By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place  they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship  which is that of us and nature. And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver  that  as we've seen  are unsustainable. So what are we going to do about that  It's not a new question.     years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself. This is the frontispiece of his book  Utopia.  And it was a series of semi independent city states  if that sounds remotely familiar  a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming mad  and grew vegetables in their back gardens  and ate communal meals together  and so on. And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia  even though More never framed it that way. And here is another very famous  Utopian  vision  that of Ebenezer Howard   The Garden City.  Same idea  series of semi independent city states  little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around  joined to one another by railway. And again  food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision. It even got built  but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had. And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas  that they are Utopian. Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately. It was a kind of joke  because it's got a double derivation from the Greek. It can either mean a good place  or no place. Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it. And I think  as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling  that makes it not much use. So I've come up with an alternative  which is Sitopia  from the ancient Greek   sitos  for food  and  topos  for place. I believe we already live in Sitopia. We live in a world shaped by food  and if we realize that  we can use food as a really powerful tool    a conceptual tool  design tool  to shape the world differently. So if we were to do that  what might Sitopia look like  Well I think it looks a bit like this. I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog. But anyway  this is     Laughter  it's food at the center of life  at the center of family life  being celebrated  being enjoyed  people taking time for it. This is where food should be in our society. But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this. By the way  these can be men as well. It's people who think about food  who think ahead  who plan  who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them. We need these people. We're part of a network. Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this. Here  I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable. But networks  markets where food is being grown locally. It's common. It's fresh. It's part of the social life of the city. Because without that  you can't have this kind of place  food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape  and is not just a zero sum commodity off in some unseen hell hole. Cows with a view. Steaming piles of humus. This is basically bringing the whole thing together. And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto. It's a greenhouse  where kids get told all about food and growing their own food. Here is a plant called Kevin  or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know. But anyway  these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important. So Sitopia  for me  is really a way of seeing. It's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere. The trick is to join them up  to use food as a way of seeing. And if we do that  we're going to stop seeing cities as big  metropolitan  unproductive blobs  like this. We're going to see them more like this  as part of the productive  organic framework of which they are inevitably a part  symbiotically connected. But of course  that's not a great image either  because we need not to be producing food like this anymore. We need to be thinking more about permaculture  which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing. It's a re conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives. The best image I know of this is from     years ago. It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's  Allegory of Good Government.  It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside. And I think the message of this is very clear. If the city looks after the country  the country will look after the city. And I want us to ask now  what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today  What would an allegory of good government look like today  Because I think it's an urgent question. It's one we have to ask  and we have to start answering. We know we are what we eat. We need to realize that the world is also what we eat. But if we take that idea  we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better. Thank you very much.\n",
      "I'm Ellen  and I'm totally obsessed with food. But I didn't start out obsessed with food. I started out obsessed with global security policy because I lived in New York during       and it was obviously a very relevant thing. And I got from global security policy to food because I realized when I'm hungry  I'm really pissed off  and I'm assuming that the rest of the world is too. Especially if you're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry  you're pretty angry. And actually  lo and behold  it looks pretty much like the areas of the world that are hungry are also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure. So I took a job at the United Nations World Food Programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues. And while I was there  I came across what I think is the most brilliant of their programs. It's called School Feeding  and it's a really simple idea to sort of get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger that continues for a lot of people around the world  and stop it. By giving kids a free school meal  it gets them into school  which is obviously education  the first step out of poverty  but it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need to really develop both mentally and physically. While I was working at the U.N.  I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush. And she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag called the  Feed Bag     which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the Feed Bag. But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid. It's so simple  and we thought  you know  okay  it costs between    and    bucks to provide school feeding for a year. We could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and a ton of awareness for the World Food Programme. But of course  you know at the U.N.  sometimes things move slowly  and they basically said no. And we thought  God  this is such a good idea and it's going to raise so much money. So we said screw it  we'll just start our own company  which we did three years ago. So that was kind of my first dream  was to start this company called FEED  and here's a screenshot of our website. We did this bag for Haiti  and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in Haiti. So FEED's doing great. We've so far provided    million meals to kids around the world by selling now         bags  a ton of bags  a lot of bags. All this time you're    when you think about hunger  it's a hard thing to think about  because what we think about is eating. I think about eating a lot  and I really love it. And the thing that's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know   What are you doing in America    What are you doing for America's kids   There's definitely hunger in America     million people and almost   .  million children. I mean that's pretty dramatic for our own country. Hunger definitely means something a little bit different in America than it does internationally  but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country. But obviously the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity  and it's dramatic. The other thing that's dramatic is that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last    years. Unfortunately  obesity's not only an American problem. It's actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we're exporting. The numbers are pretty crazy. There's a billion people obese or overweight and a billion people hungry. So those seem like two bifurcated problems  but I kind of started to think about  you know  what is obesity and hunger  What are both those things about  Well  they're both about food. And when you think about food  the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture. And agriculture is where food comes from. Well  agriculture in America's very interesting. It's very consolidated  and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat. Well  the foods that are produced are  more or less  corn  soy and wheat. And as you can see  that's three quarters of the food that we're eating for the most part  processed foods and fast foods. Unfortunately  in our agricultural system  we haven't done a good job in the last three decades of exporting those technologies around the world. So African agriculture  which is the place of most hunger in the world  has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen. So somehow we're not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world. Who is farming them  That's what I was wondering. So I went and stood on a big grain bin in the Midwest  and that really didn't help me understand farming  but I think it's a really cool picture. And you know  the reality is that between farmers in America  who actually  quite frankly  when I spend time in the Midwest  are pretty large in general. And their farms are also large. But farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny  and that's because they're starving. Most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers. And most of those people are women    which is a totally other topic that I won't get on right now  but I'd love to do the feminist thing at some point. I think it's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides. There's this large  consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America  and it's really been since around       after the oil crisis  when  you know  mass consolidation  mass exodus of small farmers in this country. And then in the same time period  you know  we've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing. Unfortunately  what is farmed ends up as what we eat. And in America  a lot of what we eat has led to obesity and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is in the last    years. It's crazy. A fifth of kids under two drinks soda. Hello. You don't put soda in bottles. But people do because it's so cheap  and so our whole food system in the last    years has really shifted. I think  you know  it's not just in our own country  but really we're exporting the system around the world  and when you look at the data of least developed countries    especially in cities  which are growing really rapidly    people are eating American processed foods. And in one generation  they're going from hunger  and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger  to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation. So the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity. Not to beat a dead horse  but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese. I think that's the only way to look at it. And instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate  it's really important to look at them as one system. We get a lot of our food from all around the world  and people from all around the world are importing our food system  so it's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it. The thing is  I've learned    and the technology people that are here  which I'm totally not one of them    but apparently  it really takes    years for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us  like the mouse and the Internet and Windows. You know  there's    year cycles. I think      can be a really interesting year because it is the end of the    year cycle  and it's the birthday of the global food system. So that's the first birthday I want to talk about. You know  I think if we really think that this is something that's happened in the last    years  there's hope in that. It's the thirtieth anniversary of GMO crops and the Big Gulp  Chicken McNuggets  high fructose corn syrup  the farm crisis in America and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally. So there's a lot of reasons to take this    year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system. I'm not the only one who's obsessed with this whole    year thing. The icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish both addressed this last three decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change. Well  I really care about      because it's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year. And so in my lifetime  a lot of what's happened in the world    and being a person obsessed with food    a lot of this has really changed. So my second dream is that I think we can look to the next    years as a time to change the food system again. And we know what's happened in the past  so if we start now  and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term  we might be able to recreate the food system so when I give my next talk and I'm    years old  I'll be able to say that it's been a success. So I'm announcing today the start of a new organization  or a new fund within the FEED Foundation  called the    Project. And the    Project is really focused on these long term ideas for food system change. And I think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity  we might actually look for long term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone. We all tend to think that these systems are quite different  and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world  but if we take a    year view  there's more hope in collaborative ideas. So I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the ONE campaign and Slow Food  which don't seem right now to have much in common  we can talk about holistic  long term  systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone. Some ideas I've had is like  look  the reality is    kids in the South Bronx need apples and carrots and so do kids in Botswana. And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods  Another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish. Understanding how to produce protein in a way that's healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers. And you know  these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in Africa who are small farmers and people in America who are farmers and eaters. And I also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way  where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips. Well  if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple  then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three quarters of the products being made just from corn  soy and wheat. The   Project.org is launched  and I've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start. And it'll be growing over the next few months. But I really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at things like the food system and make change.\n",

      "I'm a cancer doctor  and I walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago  and this was the cover of Fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy. And so  as a cancer doctor  you look at this  and you get a little bit downhearted. But when you start to read the article by Cliff  who himself is a cancer survivor  who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York to get an experimental therapy for    at the time    Hodgkin's disease  which saved his life  he makes remarkable points here. And the point of the article was that we have gotten reductionist in our view of biology  in our view of cancer. For the last    years  we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer  not in controlling cancer. So  this is an astounding table. And this is something that sobers us in our field everyday in that  obviously  we've made remarkable impacts on cardiovascular disease  but look at cancer. The death rate in cancer in over    years hasn't changed. We've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia  where we have a pill that can put     percent of people in remission  but in general  we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer. So  what I'm going to tell you today  is a little bit of why I think that's the case  and then go out of my comfort zone and tell you where I think it's going  where a new approach    that we hope to push forward in terms of treating cancer. Because this is wrong. So  what is cancer  first of all  Well  if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value  you go to a doctor  they stick a needle in. They way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition  Does it look normal  Does it look abnormal  So  that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle. This is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell. That is the state of the art today in diagnosing cancer. There's no molecular test  there's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday  there's no fancy looking at the chromosomes. This is the state of the art and how we do it. You know  I know very well  as a cancer doctor  I can't treat advanced cancer. So  as an aside  I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early. It is the only way you can start to fight cancer  is by catching it early. We can prevent most cancers. You know  the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease. We could do the same in cancer. I co founded a company called Navigenics  where  if you spit into a tube    and we can look look at    or    genetic markers for disease  all of which are delayable in many of the cancers    you start to identify what you could get  and then we can start to work to prevent them. Because the problem is  when you have advanced cancer  we can't do that much today about it  as the statistics allude to. So  the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged. Why is it a disease of the aged  Because evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children. See  evolution protected us during our childbearing years and then  after age    or    or     it said  It doesn't matter anymore  because they've had their progeny.  So if you look at cancers  it is very rare    extremely rare    to have cancer in a child  on the order of thousands of cases a year. As one gets older  Very  very common. Why is it hard to treat  Because it's heterogeneous  and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer. It starts to select out for those bad  aggressive cells  what we call clonal selection. But  if we start to understand that cancer isn't just a molecular defect  it's something more  then we'll get to new ways of treating it  as I'll show you. So  one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that  right now  we describe it by a number of adjectives  symptoms   I'm tired  I'm bloated  I have pain  etc.  You then have some anatomic descriptions  you get that CT scan   There's a three centimeter mass in the liver.  You then have some body part descriptions   It's in the liver  in the breast  in the prostate.  And that's about it. So  our dictionary for describing cancer is very  very poor. It's basically symptoms. It's manifestations of a disease. What's exciting is that over the last two or three years  the government has spent     million dollars  and they've allocated another billion dollars  to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project. So  it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer  and giving us a new lexicon  a new dictionary to describe it. You know  in the mid     's in France  they started to describe cancer by body part. That hasn't changed in over     years. It is absolutely archaic that we call cancer by prostate  by breast  by muscle. It makes no sense  if you think about it. So  obviously  the technology is here today  and  over the next several years  that will change. You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic. You will go to a HER  amplified clinic  or an EGFR activated clinic  and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions that were involved in causing this individual cancer. So  hopefully  we will go from being the art of medicine more to the science of medicine  and be able to do what they do in infectious disease  which is look at that organism  that bacteria  and then say   This antibiotic makes sense  because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it.  When one is exposed to H N   you take Tamiflu  and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease. Why  Because we know what you have  and we know how to treat it    although we can't make vaccine in this country  but that's a different story. The Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now. The first cancer was done  which was brain cancer. In the next month  the end of December  you'll see ovarian cancer  and then lung cancer will come several months after. There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes  which I think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease. But remember  I'm not pushing genomics  proteomics  to be a reductionist. I'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against. And there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to. In health care today  we spend most of the dollars    in terms of treating disease    most of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life. We spend very little  if any  dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against. If you could start to move that  to identify what you're up against  you're going to do things a hell of a lot better. If we could even take it one step further and prevent disease  we can take it enormously the other direction  and obviously  that's where we need to go  going forward. So  this is the website of the National Cancer Institute. And I'm here to tell you  it's wrong. So  the website of the National Cancer Institute says that cancer is a genetic disease. The website says   If you look  there's an individual mutation  and maybe a second  and maybe a third  and that is cancer.  But  as a cancer doc  this is what I see. This isn't a genetic disease. So  there you see  it's a liver with colon cancer in it  and you see into the microscope a lymph node where cancer has invaded. You see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver. Cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment. It's not in the abstract  it's the interaction with the environment. It's what we call a system. The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer. And I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades  is that we have strived to understand cancer. The goal is to control cancer. And that is a very different optimization scheme  a very different strategy for all of us. I got up at the American Association of Cancer Research  one of the big cancer research meetings  with        people there  and I said   We've made a mistake. We've all made a mistake  myself included  by focusing down  by being a reductionist. We need to take a step back.  And  believe it or not  there were hisses in the audience. People got upset  but this is the only way we're going to go forward. You know  I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago. We were pushed together  and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other. I said   Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney  who designed computers   And he was saying  Does he really want to meet another doctor  But people prevailed on us  and we got together  and it's been transformative in what I do  absolutely transformative. We have designed  and we have worked on the modeling    and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team    the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system. And I'll show you some data there where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it. The key is  when you look at these variables and you look at this data  you have to understand the data inputs. You know  if I measured your temperature over    days  and I asked   What was the average temperature   and it came back at   .   I would say   Great.  But if during one of those days your temperature spiked to     for six hours  and you took Tylenol and got better  etc.  I would totally miss it. So  one of the problems  the fundamental problems in medicine is that you and I  and all of us  we go to our doctor once a year. We have discrete data elements  we don't have a time function on them. Earlier it was referred to this direct life device. You know  I've been using it for two and a half months. It's a staggering device  not because it tells me how many kilocalories I do every day  but because it looks  over    hours  what I've done in a day. And I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk  and I'm not moving at all. And a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here are really different than we understand them  because we're not measuring them dynamically. And so  if you think of cancer as a system  there's an input and an output and a state in the middle. So  the states  are equivalent classes of history  and the cancer patient  the input  is the environment  the diet  the treatment  the genetic mutations. The output are our symptoms  Do we have pain  Is the cancer growing  Do we feel bloated  etc.  Most of that state is hidden. So what we do in our field is we change and input  we give aggressive chemotherapy  and we say   Did that output get better  Did that pain improve  etc.   And so  the problem is that it's not just one system  it's multiple systems on multiple scales. It's a system of systems. And so  when you start to look at emergent systems  you can look at a neuron under a microscope. A neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here  but when you start to put them together in a complex system  and you start to see that it becomes a brain  and that brain can create intelligence  what we're talking about in the body  and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system. Well  the bad news is that these robust    and robust is a key word    emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail. The good news is you can manipulate them. You can try to control them without that fundamental understanding of every component. One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine  where they took women who were pre menopausal with breast cancer. So  about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get. They had gotten their chemotherapy  and then they randomized them  where half got placebo  and half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone. It's used to treat osteoporosis  and they got that twice a year. They looked and  in these       women  given twice a year a drug that builds bone  you reduce the recurrence of cancer by    percent. Reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug that doesn't even touch the cancer. So the notion  you change the soil  the seed doesn't grow as well. You change that system  and you could have a marked effect on the cancer. Nobody has ever shown    and this will be shocking    nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell. It's never been shown. There's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes  that if you give this cancer drug  you can do this effect to the cell  but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near the doses that happen in the body. If I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol every three weeks  which is the standard  about    percent of women with metastatic cancer have a great response to that drug. And a response is    percent shrinkage. Well  remember that's not even an order of magnitude  but that's a different story. They then recur  I give them that same drug every week. Another    percent will respond. They then recur  I give them that same drug over    hours by continuous infusion  another    or    percent will respond. So  you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size. It's not. We have no idea the mechanism. So the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system  just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence  chemotherapy may work by that same exact way. The wild thing about that trial also  was that it reduced new primaries  so new cancers  by    percent also. So  the problem is  yours and mine  all of our systems are changing. They're dynamic. I mean  this is a scary slide  not to take an aside  but it looks at obesity in the world. And I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers  they're kind of small. But  if you start to look at it  that red  that dark color there  more than    percent of the population of those countries are obese. Look a decade ago  look two decades ago  markedly different. So  our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago. So the diseases we have today  which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades  are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this. So  this picture  although it is beautiful  is a    gigabyte picture of the whole proteome. So this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet  and we're able to get resolution where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body. We can start to see that system. Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified. The power of these magnets  the power of what we can do here  is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology. So  again  this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis and a group called Applied Proteomics  where we can start to see individual neutron differences  and we can start to look at that system like we never have before. So  instead of a reductionist view  we're taking a step back. So this is a woman     years old  who had recurrent lung cancer. It was in her brain  in her lungs  in her liver. She had gotten Carboplatin Taxol  Carboplatin Taxotere  Gemcitabine  Navelbine  Every drug we have she had gotten  and that disease continued to grow. She had three kids under the age of     and this is her CT scan. And so what this is  is we're taking a cross section of her body here  and you can see in the middle there is her heart  and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her  untreated  in a matter of weeks. She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway  and again  I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system  in the cancer  but it targeted a pathway  and a month later  pow  that cancer's gone. Six months later it's still gone. That cancer recurred  and she passed away three years later from lung cancer  but she got three years from a drug whose symptoms predominately were acne. That's about it. So  the problem is that the clinical trial was done  and we were a part of it  and in the fundamental clinical trial    the pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three  we refused to use a placebo. Would you want your mother  your brother  your sister to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live  And the answer  obviously  is not. So  it was done on this group of patients. Ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here  and the drug went to the FDA  and the FDA said   Without a placebo  how do I know patients actually benefited from the drug   So the morning the FDA was going to meet  this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal. And so  what do you know  that drug was approved. The amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial  where they gave half placebo and half the drug. And we learned something important there. What's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada  where it's  more ethical to give placebos.  They had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval  so I think there were three U.S. patients in upstate New York who were part of the trial. But they did that  and what they found is that    percent of the non responders lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo. So it challenged everything we knew in cancer  is that you don't need to get a response. You don't need to shrink the disease. If we slow the disease  we may have more of a benefit on patient survival  patient outcome  how they feel  than if we shrink the disease. The problem is that  if I'm this doc  and I get your CT scan today and you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver  and you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters  did that drug help you or not  How do I know  Would it have been    centimeters  or am I giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost  So  it's a fundamental problem. And  again  that's where these new technologies can come in. And so  the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office    well  the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease  right  The ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening. That is the most effective  cost effective  best way we can do things today. But if one is unfortunate to get a disease  you'll go into your doctor's office  he or she will take a drop of blood  and we will start to know how to treat your disease. The way we've approached it is the field of proteomics  again  this looking at the system. It's taking a big picture. The problem with technologies like this is that if one looks at proteins in the body  there are    orders of magnitude difference between the high abundant and the low abundant proteins. So  there's no technology in the world that can span    orders of magnitude. And so  a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles  try to bring the software. We can start to look at different components along this spectrum. And so  earlier was talked about cross discipline  about collaboration. And I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now is that people from those fields are coming in. Yesterday  the National Cancer Institute announced a new program called the Physical Sciences and Oncology  where physicists  mathematicians  are brought in to think about cancer  people who never approached it before. Danny and I got    million dollars  they announced yesterday  to try to attach this problem. A whole new approach  instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by different mechanisms  to try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body. So  just for two seconds  how these technologies work    because I think it's important to understand it. What happens is every protein in your body is charged  so the proteins are sprayed in  the magnet spins them around  and then there's a detector at the end. When it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge. And so we can accurately    if the magnet is big enough  and your resolution is high enough    you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding of the individual system. And so  as a cancer doctor  instead of having paper in my chart  in your chart  and it being this thick  this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices  where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data. Electronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease. And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter and actually move forward  instead of just having encounter and encounter  without fundamental learning. So  to conclude  we need to get away from reductionist thinking. We need to start to think differently and radically. And so  I implore everyone here  Think differently. Come up with new ideas. Tell them to me or anyone else in our field  because over the last    years  nothing has changed. We need a radically different approach. You know  Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel    and Andy was one of my mentors  tough individual. When Andy stepped down  he said   No technology will win. Technology itself will win.  And I'm a firm believer  in the field of medicine and especially cancer  that it's going to be a broad platform of technologies that will help us move forward and hopefully help patients in the near term. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Everyone's familiar with cancer  but we don't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease. The Tasmanian devil has shown us that  not only can cancer be a contagious disease  but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction. So first of all  what is a Tasmanian devil  Many of you might be familiar with Taz  the cartoon character  the one that spins around and around and around. But not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil  and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial. A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo. The Tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes. The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger  and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.  The  Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania  which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia. And despite their ferocious appearance  Tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals. In fact  growing up in Tasmania  it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a Tasmanian devil in the wild. But the Tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline. And in fact  there's concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within    to    years. And the reason for that is the emergence of a new disease  a contagious cancer. The story begins in      when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a Tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face. At the time  this was thought to be a one off. Animals  just like humans  sometimes get strange tumors. However  we now believe that this is the first sighting of a new disease  which is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania. The disease was first sighted in the northeast of Tasmania in      and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave. Now there's only a small part of the population  which remains unaffected. This disease appears first as tumors  usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected Tasmanian devils. These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors  such as these ones here. And the next image I'm going to show is quite gruesome. But inevitably  these tumors progress towards being enormous  ulcerating tumors like this one here. This one in particular sticks in my mind  because this is the first case of this disease that I saw myself. And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil with this huge ulcerating  foul smelling tumor inside her mouth that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw. She hadn't eaten for days. Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms. Her body was riddled with secondary tumors. And yet  she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils in her pouch. Of course  they died along with the mother. They were too young to survive without their mother. In fact  in the area where she comes from  more than    percent of the Tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease. Scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer  this infectious cancer  that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population. And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women  which is spread by a virus  and to the AIDS epidemic  which is associated with a number of different types of cancer. All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus. However  we now know    and I'll tell you right now    that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus. In fact  the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister  and something that we hadn't really thought of before. But in order for me to explain what that is  I need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself. Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year. One in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives. I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when I was only   . Cancer occurs when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes that cause that cell to start to produce more and more and more copies of itself. Paradoxically  once established  natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer. Natural selection is survival of the fittest. And when you have a population of fast dividing cancer cells  if one of them acquires new mutations  which allow them to grow more quickly  acquire nutrients more successfully  invade the body  they'll be selected for by evolution. That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat. It evolves. Throw a drug at it  and resistant cells will grow back. An amazing fact is that  given the right environment and the right nutrients  a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever. However cancer is constrained by living inside our bodies  and its continued growth  its spreading through our bodies and eating away at our tissues  leads to the death of the cancer patient and also to the death of the cancer itself. So cancer could be thought of as a strange  short lived  self destructive life form    an evolutionary dead end. But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation. And the answer came from studying the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA. This was work from many people  but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that I did a few years ago. The next slide is going to be gruesome. This is Jonas. He's a Tasmanian devil that we found with a large tumor on his face. And being a geneticist  I'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations. So I took this opportunity to collect some samples from Jonas' tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body. I took these back to the lab. I extracted DNA from them. And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA  and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor to that of the rest of his body  I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile. In fact  Jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you. What this told us was that Jonas' tumor did not arise from cells of his own body. In fact  more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in Jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil    and Jonas was clearly a male. So how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on Jonas' face  Well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers from all around Tasmania. We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA. Think about that for a minute. That means that all of these cancers actually are the same cancer that arose once from one individual devil  that have broken free of that first devil's body and spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population. But how can a cancer spread in a population  Well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild. They tend to bite each other  often quite ferociously and usually on the face. We think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor  get into the saliva. When the devil bites another devil  it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil  so the tumor continues to grow. So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer. It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it. It spreads through the population  has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system  and it's the only cancer that we know of that's threatening an entire species with extinction. But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils  why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans  Well the answer is  it has. This is Kimbo. He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya. Last year  his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region. She took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting. And if you're squeamish  please look away now. He discovered this  a huge bleeding tumor at the base of Kimbo's penis. The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor  a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs. And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells  so is this dog cancer. But this dog cancer is quite remarkable  because it spread all around the world. And in fact  these same cells that are affecting Kimbo here are also found affecting dogs in New York City  in mountain villages in the Himalayas and in Outback Australia. We also believe this cancer might be very old. In fact  genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old  which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the Neanderthals. This cancer is remarkable. It's the oldest mammalian derived life form that we know of. It's a living relic of the distant past. So we've seen that this can happen in animals. Could cancers be contagious between people  Well this is a question which fascinated Chester Southam  a cancer doctor in the     s. Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else. And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in      injecting cancer into a volunteer  who in this case was an inmate in Ohio State Penitentiary. Most of the people that Dr. Southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells. But a small number of them did  and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill    whose immune systems were probably compromised. What this tells us  ethical issues aside  is that ... it's probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people. However  under some circumstances  it can happen. And I think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future. So just finally  cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments. But that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer. In fact  I believe  given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth  we can defeat cancer. My personal aim is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer. Let's prevent the Tasmanian devil from being the first animal to go extinct from cancer. Thank you.\n",
      "Almost a year ago  my aunt started suffering back pains. She went to see the doctor and they told her it was a normal injury for someone who had been playing tennis for almost    years. They recommended that she do some therapy  but after a while she wasn't feeling better  so the doctors decided to do further tests. They did an x ray and discovered an injury in her lungs  and at the time they thought that the injury was a strain in the muscles and tendons between her ribs  but after a few weeks of treatment  again her health wasn't getting any better. So finally  they decided to do a biopsy  and two weeks later  the results of the biopsy came back. It was stage   lung cancer. Her lifestyle was almost free of risk. She never smoked a cigarette  she never drank alcohol  and she had been playing sports for almost half her life. Perhaps  that is why it took them almost six months to get her properly diagnosed. My story might be  unfortunately  familiar to most of you. One out of three people sitting in this audience will be diagnosed with some type of cancer  and one out of four will die because of it. Not only did that cancer diagnosis change the life of our family  but that process of going back and forth with new tests  different doctors describing symptoms  discarding diseases over and over  was stressful and frustrating  especially for my aunt. And that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done since the beginning of history. We have   st century medical treatments and drugs to treat cancer  but we still have   th century procedures and processes for diagnosis  if any. Today  most of us have to wait for symptoms to indicate that something is wrong. Today  the majority of people still don't have access to early cancer detection methods  even though we know that catching cancer early is basically the closest thing we have to a silver bullet cure against it. We know that we can change this in our lifetime  and that is why my team and I have decided to begin this journey  this journey to try to make cancer detection at the early stages and monitoring the appropriate  response at the molecular level easier  cheaper  smarter and more accessible than ever before. The context  of course  is that we're living at a time where technology is disrupting our present at exponential rates  and the biological realm is no exception. It is said today that biotech is advancing at least six times faster than the growth rate of the processing power of computers. But progress in biotech is not only being accelerated  it is also being democratized. Just as personal computers or the Internet or smartphones leveled the playing field for entrepreneurship  politics or education  recent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well  and that is allowing multidisciplinary teams like ours to try to tackle and look at these problems with new approaches. We are a team of scientists and technologists from Chile  Panama  Mexico  Israel and Greece  and based on recent scientific discoveries  we believe that we have found a reliable and accurate way of detecting several types of cancer at the very early stages through a blood sample. We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that circulate freely in our blood called microRNAs. To explain what microRNAs are and their important role in cancer  I need to start with proteins  because when cancer is present in our body  protein modification is observed in all cancerous cells. As you might know  proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body  like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating DNA  but before a protein is expressed or produced  relevant parts of its genetic code present in the DNA are copied into the messenger RNA  so this messenger RNA has instructions on how to build a specific protein  and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins  but the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build are microRNAs. So microRNAs are small molecules that regulate gene expression. Unlike DNA  which is mainly fixed  microRNAs can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time  telling us which genes are actively  expressed at that particular moment. And that is what makes microRNAs such a promising biomarker for cancer  because as you know  cancer is a disease of altered gene expression. It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes. Another important thing to consider is that no two cancers are the same  but at the microRNA level  there are patterns. Several scientific studies have shown that abnormal microRNA expression levels varies and creates a unique  specific pattern for each type of cancer  even at the early stages  reflecting the progression of the disease  and whether it's responding to medication or in remission  making microRNAs a perfect  highly sensitive biomarker. However  the problem with microRNAs is that we cannot use existing DNA based technology to detect them in a reliable way  because they are very short sequences of nucleotides  much smaller than DNA. And also  all microRNAs are very similar to each other  with just tiny differences. So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules  extremely similar  extremely small. We believe that we have found a way to do so  and this is the first time that we've shown it in public. Let me do a demonstration. Imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test  a lab technician extracts a total RNA  which is quite simple today  and puts it in a standard     well plate like this one. Each well of these plates has specific biochemistry that we assign  that is looking for a specific microRNA  acting like a trap that closes only when the microRNA is present in the sample  and when it does  it will shine with green color. To run the reaction  you put the plate inside a device like this one  and then you can put your smartphone on top of it. If we can have a camera here so you can see my screen. A smartphone is a connected computer and it's also a camera  good enough for our purpose. The smartphone is taking pictures  and when the reaction is over  it will send the pictures to our online database for processing and interpretation. This entire process lasts around    minutes  but when the process is over  wells that shine are matched  with the specific microRNAs and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast they shine. And then  when this entire process is over  this is what happens. This chart is showing the specific microRNAs present in this sample and how they reacted over time. Then  if we take this specific pattern of microRNA of this person's samples and compare it with existing scientific documentation that correlates microRNA patterns with a specific presence of a disease  this is how pancreatic cancer looks like. This inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer. Another important aspect of this approach is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud  so we can get results in real time and analyze them with our contextual information. If we want to better understand and decode diseases like cancer  we need to stop treating them as acute  isolated episodes  and consider and measure everything that affects our health on a permanent basis. This entire platform is a working prototype. It uses state of the art molecular biology  a low cost   D printed device  and data science to try to tackle one of humanity's  toughest challenges. Since we believe early cancer detection should really be democratized  this entire solution costs at least    times less than current available methods  and we know that the community can help us accelerate this even more  so we're making the design of the device open source. Let me say very clearly that we are at the very early stages  but so far  we have been able to successfully identify the microRNA pattern of pancreatic cancer  lung cancer  breast cancer and hepatic cancer. And currently  we're doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center with     women for breast cancer. This is the single non invasive  accurate and affordable test that has the potential to dramatically change how cancer procedures and diagnostics have been done. Since we're looking for the microRNA patterns in your blood at any given time  you don't need to know which cancer you're looking for. You don't need to have any symptoms. You only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools. Today  cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear. That is  at stage   or    and I believe that is too late. It is too expensive for our families. It is too expensive for humanity. We cannot lose the war against cancer. It not only costs us billions of dollars  but it also costs us the people we love. Today  my aunt  she's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude. However  I want fights like this to become very rare. I want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages  and I'm certain that in the very near future  because of this and other breakthroughs that we are seeing every day in the life sciences  the way we see cancer will radically change. It will give us the chance of detecting it early  understanding it better  and finding a cure. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Good afternoon. There's a medical revolution happening all around us  and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions  including cancer. The revolution is called angiogenesis  and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels. So why should we care about blood vessels  Well  the human body is literally packed with them           miles worth in a typical adult. End to end  that would form a line that would circle the earth twice. The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries. We've got    billion of them in our bodies. And these are the vessels of life  and as I'll show you  they can also be the vessels of death. Now  the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in. For example  in the liver  they form channels to detoxify the blood  in the lungs  they line air sacs for gas exchange. In muscle  they corkscrew  so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation. And in nerves  they course along like power lines  keeping those nerves alive. We get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb. And what that means is that as adults  blood vessels don't normally grow. Except in a few special circumstances. In women  blood vessels grow every month  to build the lining of the uterus. During pregnancy  they form the placenta  which connects mom and baby. And after injury  blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound. And this is actually what it looks like  hundreds of blood vessels  all growing toward the center of the wound. So the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time. It does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances  stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis  such that  when we need a brief burst of blood vessels  the body can do this by releasing stimulators  proteins called angiogenic factors  that act as natural fertilizer  and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout. When those excess vessels are no longer needed  the body prunes them back to baseline  using naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis. There are other situations where we start beneath the baseline  and we need to grow more blood vessels  just to get back to normal levels    for example  after an injury    and the body can do that too  but only to that normal level  that set point. But what we now know  is that for a number of diseases  there are defects in the system  where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels  or can't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time. And in these situations  angiogenesis is out of balance. And when angiogenesis is out of balance  a myriad of diseases result. For example  insufficient angiogenesis    not enough blood vessels    leads to wounds that don't heal  heart attacks  legs without circulation  death from stroke  nerve damage. And on the other end  excessive angiogenesis    too many blood vessels    drives disease  and we see this in cancer  blindness  arthritis  obesity  Alzheimer's disease. In total  there are more than    major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide  that all look on the surface to be different from one another  but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator. And this realization is allowing us to re conceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases  by controlling angiogenesis. Now  I'm going to focus on cancer  because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer    every type of cancer. So here we go. This is a tumor  dark  gray  ominous mass growing inside a brain. And under the microscope  you can see hundreds of these brown stained blood vessels  capillaries that are feeding cancer cells  bringing oxygen and nutrients. But cancers don't start out like this  and in fact  cancers don't start out with a blood supply. They start out as small  microscopic nests of cells  that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size. That's the tip of a ballpoint pen. Then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply  so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients. In fact  we're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body. Autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about    percent of women between the ages of    and    actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts. About    percent of men in their   s and   s have microscopic prostate cancers  and virtually     percent of us  by the time we reach our   s  will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid. Yet  without a blood supply  most of these cancers will never become dangerous. Dr. Judah Folkman  who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field  once called this  cancer without disease.  So the body's ability to balance angiogenesis  when it's working properly  prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers. And this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer. In fact  if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells  tumors simply can't grow up. But once angiogenesis occurs  cancers can grow exponentially. And this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless  to being deadly. Cancer cells mutate  and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors  natural fertilizer  that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer. And once those vessels invade the cancer  it can expand  it can invade local tissues  and the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases. And unfortunately  this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed  when angiogenesis is already turned on  and cancer cells are growing like wild. So  if angiogenesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one  then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply. We call this antiangiogenic therapy  and it's completely different from chemotherapy  because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers. We can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal  healthy vessels we see in other places of the body    they're abnormal  they're very poorly constructed  and because of that  they're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them. In effect  when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy    here  an experimental drug for a glioma  which is a type of brain tumor    you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved. Here's a woman with a breast cancer  being treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin  which is FDA approved. And you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment. Well  I've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy. So a few years ago  I asked myself   Can we take this one step further and treat other cancers  even in other species   So here is a nine year old boxer named Milo  who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder. It invaded into his lungs. His veterinarian only gave him three months to live. So we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food  as well as an antiangiogenic cream  that could be applied on the surface of the tumor. And within a few weeks of treatment  we were able to slow down that cancer's growth  such that we were ultimately able to extend Milo s survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted  all with a very good quality of life. And we've subsequently treated more than     dogs. We have about a    percent response rate  and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized. So let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples. This is    year old dolphin living in Florida  and she had these lesions in her mouth that  over the course of three years  developed into invasive squamous cell cancers. So we created an antiangiogenic paste. We had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week. And over the course of seven months  the cancers completely disappeared  and the biopsies came back as normal. Here's a cancer growing on the lip of a Quarter Horse named Guinness. It's a very  very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma. It had already spread to his lymph nodes  so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip  and the oral cocktail  so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside. And over the course of six months  he experienced a complete remission. And here he is six years later  Guinness  with his very happy owner. Now obviously  antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers. And in fact  the first pioneering treatments for people as well as dogs  are already becoming available. There are    different drugs     different cancer types. But the real question is  How well do these work in practice  So here's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer. The bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy  or surgery  or radiation available. But starting in       when antiangiogenic therapies first became available  you can see that there has been a    to     percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer  multiple myeloma  colorectal cancer  and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. That's impressive. But for other tumors and cancer types  the improvements have only been modest. So I started asking myself   Why haven't we been able to do better   And the answer  to me  is obvious  we're treating cancer too late in the game  when it's already established  and oftentimes  it's already spread or metastasized. And as a doctor  I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage  achieving a cure can be difficult  if not impossible. So I went back to the biology of angiogenesis  and started thinking  Could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis  beating cancer at its own game  so the cancers could never become dangerous  This could help healthy people  as well as people who've already beaten cancer once or twice  and want to find a way to keep it from coming back. So to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer  I went back to look at cancer's causes. And what really intrigued me  was when I saw that diet accounts for    to    percent of environmentally caused cancers. Now the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet  what to strip out  take away. But I actually took a completely opposite approach  and began asking  What could we be adding to our diet that's naturally antiangiogenic  and that could boost the body's defense system  and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers  In other words  can we eat to starve cancer  Well  the answer is yes  and I'm going to show you how. And our search for this has taken us to the market  the farm and to the spice cabinet  because what we've discovered is that Mother Nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis. Here's a test system we developed. At the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion. And we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating. Let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes. The active ingredient is resveratrol  it's also found in red wine. This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis  by    percent. Here's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries. It potently inhibits angiogenesis. And extract from soybeans. And here is a growing list of antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying. For each food type  we believe that there are different potencies within different strains and varietals. And we want to measure this because  well  while you're eating a strawberry or drinking tea  why not select the one that's most potent for preventing cancer  So here are four different teas that we've tested. They're all common ones  Chinese jasmine  Japanese sencha  Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared  and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency  from less potent to more potent. But what's very cool is when we combine the two less potent teas together  the combination  the blend  is more potent than either one alone. This means there's food synergy. Here's some more data from our testing. Now in the lab  we can simulate tumor angiogenesis  represented here in a black bar. And using this system  we can test the potency of cancer drugs. So the shorter the bar  the less angiogenesis    that's good. And here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people. Statins  nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  and a few others    they inhibit angiogenesis  too. And here are the dietary factors going head to head against these drugs. You can see they clearly hold their own  and in some cases  they're more potent than the actual drugs. Soy  parsley  garlic  grapes  berries. I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients. Imagine if we could create the world's first rating system  in which we could score foods according to their antiangiogenic  cancer preventative properties. And that's what we're doing right now. Now  I've shown you a bunch of lab data  and so the real question is  What is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer  Well  the best example I know is a study of        men followed over    years  in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week  had up to a    percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer. Now  we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene  and lycopene is antiangiogenic. But what's even more interesting from this study  is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer  those who ate more servings of tomato sauce  actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer. So this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels  can have an impact on cancer. And we're now studying the role of a healthy diet    with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University    the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream. Obviously  what I've shared with you has some far ranging implications  even beyond cancer research. Because if we're right  it could impact consumer education  food services  public health and even the insurance industry. And in fact  some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines. Check out this ad from BlueCross BlueShield of Minnesota. For many people around the world  dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution  because not everybody can afford expensive end stage cancer treatments  but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local  sustainable  antiangiogenic crops. Now  finally  I've talked to you about food  and I've talked to you about cancer  so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about  and that's obesity. Because it turns out that adipose tissue    fat    is highly angiogenesis dependent. And like a tumor  fat grows when blood vessels grow. So the question is  Can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply  The top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop until it turns fat  like this furry tennis ball. And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse. If you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor  it loses weight. Stop the treatment  gains the weight back. Restart the treatment  loses the weight. Stop the treatment  it gains the weight back. And  in fact  you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting angiogenesis. So this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity. The truly interesting thing about this is that we can't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be. In other words  we can't create supermodel mice. And this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy set points. Albert Szent Gy rgi once said   Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen  and thinking what no one has thought.  I hope I've convinced you that for diseases like cancer  obesity and other conditions  there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator  angiogenesis. And that's what I think the world needs now. Thank you. June Cohen  I have a quick question for you. JC  So these drugs aren't exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now. For anyone out here who has cancer  what would you recommend  Do you recommend pursuing these treatments now  for most cancer patients  William Li  There are antiangiogenic treatments that are FDA approved  and if you're a cancer patient  or working for one or advocating for one  you should ask about them. And there are many clinical trials. The Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost     companies  and there are about     more drugs in that pipeline. So  consider the approved ones  look for clinical trials  but then between what the doctor can do for you  we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves. This is one of the themes I'm talking about  We can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can't do for us  which is to use knowledge and take action. And if Mother Nature has given us some clues  we think there might be a new future in the value of how we eat  and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day. JC  Right. And along those lines  for people who might have risk factors for cancer  would you recommend pursuing any treatments prophylactically  or simply pursuing the right diet  with lots of tomato sauce  WL  Well  you know  there's abundant epidemiological evidence  and I think in the information age  it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed  the National Library of Medicine  to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications. And that's certainly something that anybody can look into. JC  Okay. Well  thank you so much.\n",
      "Cancer affects all of us    especially the ones that come back over and over again  the highly invasive and drug resistant ones  the ones that defy medical treatment  even when we throw our best drugs at them. Engineering at the molecular level  working at the smallest of scales  can provide exciting new ways to fight the most aggressive forms of cancer. Cancer is a very clever disease. There are some forms of cancer  which  fortunately  we've learned how to address relatively well with known and established drugs and surgery. But there are some forms of cancer that don't respond to these approaches  and the tumor survives or comes back  even after an onslaught of drugs. We can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer as kind of supervillains in a comic book. They're clever  they're adaptable  and they're very good at staying alive. And  like most supervillains these days  their superpowers come from a genetic mutation. The genes that are modified inside these tumor cells can enable and encode for new and unimagined modes of survival  allowing the cancer cell to live through even our best chemotherapy treatments. One example is a trick in which a gene allows a cell  even as the drug approaches the cell  to push the drug out  before the drug can have any effect. Imagine    the cell effectively spits out the drug. This is just one example of the many genetic tricks in the bag of our supervillain  cancer. All due to mutant genes. So  we have a supervillain with incredible superpowers. And we need a new and powerful mode of attack. Actually  we can turn off a gene. The key is a set of molecules known as siRNA. siRNA are short sequences of genetic code that guide a cell to block a certain gene. Each siRNA molecule can turn off a specific gene inside the cell. For many years since its discovery  scientists have been very excited about how we can apply these gene blockers in medicine. But  there is a problem. siRNA works well inside the cell. But if it gets exposed to the enzymes that reside in our bloodstream or our tissues  it degrades within seconds. It has to be packaged  protected through its journey through the body on its way to the final target inside the cancer cell. So  here's our strategy. First  we'll dose the cancer cell with siRNA  the gene blocker  and silence those survival genes  and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug. But how do we carry that out  Using molecular engineering  we can actually design a superweapon that can travel through the bloodstream. It has to be tiny enough to get through the bloodstream  it's got to be small enough to penetrate the tumor tissue  and it's got to be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell. To do this job well  it has to be about one one hundredth the size of a human hair. Let's take a closer look at how we can build this nanoparticle. First  let's start with the nanoparticle core. It's a tiny capsule that contains the chemotherapy drug. This is the poison that will actually end the tumor cell's life. Around this core  we'll wrap a very thin  nanometers thin blanket of siRNA. This is our gene blocker. Because siRNA is strongly negatively charged  we can protect it with a nice  protective layer of positively charged polymer. The two oppositely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction  and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the siRNA from degrading in the bloodstream. We're almost done. But there is one more big obstacle we have to think about. In fact  it may be the biggest obstacle of all. How do we deploy this superweapon  I mean  every good weapon needs to be targeted  we have to target this superweapon to the supervillain cells that reside in the tumor. But our bodies have a natural immune defense system  cells that reside in the bloodstream and pick out things that don't belong  so that it can destroy or eliminate them. And guess what  Our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object. We have to sneak our nanoparticle past the tumor defense system. We have to get it past this mechanism of getting rid of the foreign object by disguising it. So we add one more negatively charged layer around this nanoparticle  which serves two purposes. First  this outer layer is one of the naturally charged  highly hydrated polysaccharides that resides in our body. It creates a cloud of water molecules around the nanoparticle that gives us an invisibility cloaking effect. This invisibility cloak allows the nanoparticle to travel through the bloodstream long and far enough to reach the tumor  without getting eliminated by the body. Second  this layer contains molecules which bind specifically to our tumor cell. Once bound  the cancer cell takes up the nanoparticle  and now we have our nanoparticle inside the cancer cell and ready to deploy. Alright  I feel the same way. Let's go  The siRNA is deployed first. It acts for hours  giving enough time to silence and block those survival genes. We have now disabled those genetic superpowers. What remains is a cancer cell with no special defenses. Then  the chemotherapy drug comes out of the core and destroys the tumor cell cleanly and efficiently. With sufficient gene blockers  we can address many different kinds of mutations  allowing the chance to sweep out tumors  without leaving behind any bad guys. So  how does our strategy work  We've tested these nanostructure particles in animals using a highly aggressive form of triple negative breast cancer. This triple negative breast cancer exhibits the gene that spits out cancer drug as soon as it is delivered. Usually  doxorubicin    let's call it  dox     is the cancer drug that is the first line of treatment for breast cancer. So  we first treated our animals with a dox core  dox only. The tumor slowed their rate of growth  but they still grew rapidly  doubling in size over a period of two weeks. Then  we tried our combination superweapon. A nanolayer particle with siRNA against the chemo pump  plus  we have the dox in the core. And look    we found that not only did the tumors stop growing  they actually decreased in size and were eliminated in some cases. The tumors were actually regressing. What's great about this approach is that it can be personalized. We can add many different layers of siRNA to address different mutations and tumor defense mechanisms. And we can put different drugs into the nanoparticle core. As doctors learn how to test patients and understand certain tumor genetic types  they can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy and which gene blockers we can use. Ovarian cancer strikes a special chord with me. It is a very aggressive cancer  in part because it's discovered at very late stages  when it's highly advanced and there are a number of genetic mutations. After the first round of chemotherapy  this cancer comes back for    percent of patients. And it usually comes back in a drug resistant form. High grade ovarian cancer is one of the biggest supervillains out there. And we're now directing our superweapon toward its defeat. As a researcher  I usually don't get to work with patients. But I recently met a mother who is an ovarian cancer survivor  Mimi  and her daughter  Paige. I was deeply inspired by the optimism and strength that both mother and daughter displayed and by their story of courage and support. At this event  we spoke about the different technologies directed at cancer. And Mimi was in tears as she explained how learning about these efforts gives her hope for future generations  including her own daughter. This really touched me. It's not just about building really elegant science. It's about changing people's lives. It's about understanding the power of engineering on the scale of molecules. I know that as students like Paige move forward in their careers  they'll open new possibilities in addressing some of the big health problems in the world    including ovarian cancer  neurological disorders  infectious disease    just as chemical engineering has found a way to open doors for me  and has provided a way of engineering on the tiniest scale  that of molecules  to heal on the human scale.

      "So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers  Thomas Starzl  who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in       and Sir Roy Calne  who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K. in the following year. I returned to Singapore and  in       performed Asia's first successful cadaveric liver transplant procedure  but against all odds. Now when I look back  the transplant was actually the easiest part. Next  raising the money to fund the procedure. But perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators    a matter which was debated in the parliament    that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country. But    years on  my patient  Surinder  is Asia's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date. And perhaps more important  I am the proud godmother to her    year old son. But not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate. The truth is  there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around. As the demand for donor organs continues to rise  in large part due to the aging population  the supply has remained relatively constant. In the United States alone          men  women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs  and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs. The transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation. And the gift of life has been extended from brain dead donors to living  related donors    relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ  like a split liver graft  to a relative or loved one. But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs  the gift of life was then extended from living  related donors to now living  unrelated donors. And this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy. How can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from  for example  a submissive spouse  an in law  a servant  a slave  an employee  Where and how can we draw the line  In my part of the world  too many people live below the poverty line. And in some areas  the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living  unrelated donors. Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant  I received my next assignment  and that was to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners. I was also pregnant at the time. Pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman's life. But my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts    thoughts of walking through the prison's high security death row  as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room. And at each time  I would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me. And for two years  I struggled with the dilemma of waking up at      am on a Friday morning  driving to the prison  getting down  gloved and scrubbed  ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner  remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life to a recipient the same afternoon. No doubt  I was informed  the consent had been obtained. But  in my life  the one fulfilling skill that I had was now invoking feelings of conflict    conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk. In my team  the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience. Some of us may have been sublimated  but really none of us remained the same. I was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos. And in my mind  I realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence. It made me wonder if there could be a better way    a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide. Now just about that time  the practice of surgery evolved from big to small  from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures  tiny incisions. And in transplantation  concepts shifted from whole organs to cells. In       at the University of Minnesota  I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants. I witnessed the technical difficulty. And this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells. I thought to myself  why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas    the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes    and transplant these cells     technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ. And at that time  stem cell research had gained momentum  following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the     s. The observation that stem cells  as master cells  could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types    heart cells  liver cells  pancreatic islet cells    captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public. I too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology  and this inspired a shift in my mindset  from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells. And I focused my research on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants. Today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells. Embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage  chiefly because of their pluripotency    that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types. But the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells    the fact that these cells are derived from five day old human embryos    has encouraged research into other types of stem cells. Now to the ridicule of my colleagues  I inspired my lab to focus on what I thought was the most non controversial source of stem cells  adipose tissue  or fat  yes fat    nowadays available in abundant supply    you and I  I think  would be very happy to get rid of anyway. Fat derived stem cells are adult stem cells. And adult stem cells are found in you and me    in our blood  in our bone marrow  in our fat  our skin and other organs. And as it turns out  fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells. But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells. And here is the limitation  adult stem cells are mature cells  and  like mature human beings  these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types  as embryonic stem cells  can . But in       two remarkable individuals  Shinya Yamanaka of Japan and Jamie Thomson of the United States  made an astounding discovery. They discovered that adult cells  taken from you and me  could be reprogrammed back into embryonic like cells  which they termed IPS cells  or induced pluripotent stem cells. And so guess what  scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells    aging adult cells from you and me    they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful IPS cells. And in our lab  we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells    cells that we may use to then form other  more specialized  cells  which one day may be used as cell transplants. If this research is successful  it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos. Indeed  there is a lot of hype  but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions. Heart disease  stroke  diabetes  spinal cord injury  muscular dystrophy  retinal eye diseases    are any of these conditions relevant  personally  to you  In May       something horrible happened to me. I was about to start a robotic operation  but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room  I realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness. Earlier that week  I had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing    yes  I fell. And I started to see floaters and stars  which I casually dismissed as too much high altitude sun exposure. What happened to me might have been catastrophic  if not for the fact that I was in reach of good surgical access. And I had my vision restored  but not before a prolonged period of convalescence    three months    in a head down position. This experience taught me to empathize more with my patients  and especially those with retinal diseases.    million people worldwide are blind  and     million more suffer from impaired vision. Stem cell derived retinal transplants  now in a research phase  may one day restore vision  or part vision  to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide. Indeed  we live in both challenging as well as exciting times. As the world population ages  scientists are racing to discover new ways to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells. It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured  our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation. And these stem cells then float in the bloodstream and hone in to damaged organs to release growth factors to repair the damaged tissue. Stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body  or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver. As we speak  there are     or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases. What lies ahead  Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.  .  million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly.  .  million suffer cardiac failure. Stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function. There are     clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease. While still in a research phase  stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology. Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings    small  incremental steps  cells rather than organs  repair rather than replacement. Stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs. Powerful new technologies always present enigmas. As we speak  the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the USFDA approval. And in the U.K.  neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial. The research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers. Each one has his story. My story has been about my journey from organs to cells    a journey through controversy  inspired by hope    hope that  as we age  you and I may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life. Thank you.\n",
      "So  embryonic stem cells are really incredible cells. They are our body's own repair kits  and they're pluripotent  which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies. Soon  we actually will be able to use stem cells to replace cells that are damaged or diseased. But that's not what I want to talk to you about  because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells that are completely changing the way we look and model disease  our ability to understand why we get sick  and even develop drugs. I truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow our children to look at Alzheimer's and diabetes and other major diseases the way we view polio today  which is as a preventable disease. So here we have this incredible field  which has enormous hope for humanity  but much like IVF over    years ago  until the birth of a healthy baby  Louise  this field has been under siege politically and financially. Critical research is being challenged instead of supported  and we saw that it was really essential to have private safe haven laboratories where this work could be advanced without interference. And so  in       we started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory so that we would have a small organization that could do this work and support it. What we saw very quickly is the world of both medical research  but also developing drugs and treatments  is dominated by  as you would expect  large organizations  but in a new field  sometimes large organizations really have trouble getting out of their own way  and sometimes they can't ask the right questions  and there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger between academic research on the one hand and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs and many of our treatments  and so we knew that to really accelerate cures and therapies  we were going to have to address this with two things  new technologies and also a new research model. Because if you don't close that gap  you really are exactly where we are today. And that's what I want to focus on. We've spent the last couple of years pondering this  making a list of the different things that we had to do  and so we developed a new technology  It's software and hardware  that actually can generate thousands and thousands of genetically diverse stem cell lines to create a global array  essentially avatars of ourselves. And we did this because we think that it's actually going to allow us to realize the potential  the promise  of all of the sequencing of the human genome  but it's going to allow us  in doing that  to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells  not animal cells  to generate drugs and treatments that are much more effective  much safer  much faster  and at a much lower cost. So let me put that in perspective for you and give you some context. This is an extremely new field. In       human embryonic stem cells were first identified  and just nine years later  a group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell  or what we refer to as an IPS cell. This was really an extraordinary advance  because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells  which still remain the gold standard  they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery. So a few months later  in       one of our scientists built on that research. He took skin biopsies  this time from people who had a disease  ALS  or as you call it in the U.K.  motor neuron disease. He turned them into the IPS cells that I've just told you about  and then he turned those IPS cells into the motor neurons that actually were dying in the disease. So basically what he did was to take a healthy cell and turn it into a sick cell  and he recapitulated the disease over and over again in the dish  and this was extraordinary  because it was the first time that we had a model of a disease from a living patient in living human cells. And as he watched the disease unfold  he was able to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying in the disease in a different way than the field had previously thought. There was another kind of cell that actually was sending out a toxin and contributing to the death of these motor neurons  and you simply couldn't see it until you had the human model. So you could really say that researchers trying to understand the cause of disease without being able to have human stem cell models were much like investigators trying to figure out what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash without having a black box  or a flight recorder. They could hypothesize about what had gone wrong  but they really had no way of knowing what led to the terrible events. And stem cells really have given us the black box for diseases  and it's an unprecedented window. It really is extraordinary  because you can recapitulate many  many diseases in a dish  you can see what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation well before you would ever see symptoms appear in a patient. And this opens up the ability  which hopefully will become something that is routine in the near term  of using human cells to test for drugs. Right now  the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic. To bring a successful drug to market  it takes  on average     years   that's one drug   with a sunk cost of   billion dollars  and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road are actually going to get there. You can't imagine other businesses that you would think of going into that have these kind of numbers. It's a terrible business model. But it is really a worse social model because of what's involved and the cost to all of us. So the way we develop drugs now is by testing promising compounds on    We didn't have disease modeling with human cells  so we'd been testing them on cells of mice or other creatures or cells that we engineer  but they don't have the characteristics of the diseases that we're actually trying to cure. You know  we're not mice  and you can't go into a living person with an illness and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells and then start fooling around in a lab to test for  you know  a promising drug. But what you can do with human stem cells  now  is actually create avatars  and you can create the cells  whether it's the live motor neurons or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells or other kinds of cells  and you can test for drugs  promising compounds  on the actual cells that you're trying to affect  and this is now  and it's absolutely extraordinary  and you're going to know at the beginning  the very early stages of doing your assay development and your testing  you're not going to have to wait    years until you've brought a drug to market  only to find out that actually it doesn't work  or even worse  harms people. But it isn't really enough just to look at the cells from a few people or a small group of people  because we have to step back. We've got to look at the big picture. Look around this room. We are all different  and a disease that I might have  if I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease  it probably would affect me differently than if one of you had that disease  and if we both had Parkinson's disease  and we took the same medication  but we had different genetic makeup  we probably would have a different result  and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully for me was actually ineffective for you  and similarly  it could be that a drug that is harmful for you is safe for me  and  you know  this seems totally obvious  but unfortunately it is not the way that the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs because  until now  it hasn't had the tools. And so we need to move away from this one size fits all model. The way we've been developing drugs is essentially like going into a shoe store  no one asks you what size you are  or if you're going dancing or hiking. They just say   Well  you have feet  here are your shoes.  It doesn't work with shoes  and our bodies are many times more complicated than just our feet. So we really have to change this. There was a very sad example of this in the last decade. There's a wonderful drug  and a class of drugs actually  but the particular drug was Vioxx  and for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain  the drug was an absolute lifesaver  but unfortunately  for another subset of those people  they suffered pretty severe heart side effects  and for a subset of those people  the side effects were so severe  the cardiac side effects  that they were fatal. But imagine a different scenario  where we could have had an array  a genetically diverse array  of cardiac cells  and we could have actually tested that drug  Vioxx  in petri dishes  and figured out  well  okay  people with this genetic type are going to have cardiac side effects  people with these genetic subgroups or genetic shoes sizes  about        of them  are not going to have any problems. The people for whom it was a lifesaver could have still taken their medicine. The people for whom it was a disaster  or fatal  would never have been given it  and you can imagine a very different outcome for the company  who had to withdraw the drug. So that is terrific  and we thought  all right  as we're trying to solve this problem  clearly we have to think about genetics  we have to think about human testing  but there's a fundamental problem  because right now  stem cell lines  as extraordinary as they are  and lines are just groups of cells  they are made by hand  one at a time  and it takes a couple of months. This is not scalable  and also when you do things by hand  even in the best laboratories  you have variations in techniques  and you need to know  if you're making a drug  that the Aspirin you're going to take out of the bottle on Monday is the same as the Aspirin that's going to come out of the bottle on Wednesday. So we looked at this  and we thought  okay  artisanal is wonderful in  you know  your clothing and your bread and crafts  but artisanal really isn't going to work in stem cells  so we have to deal with this. But even with that  there still was another big hurdle  and that actually brings us back to the mapping of the human genome  because we're all different. We know from the sequencing of the human genome that it's shown us all of the A's  C's  G's and T's that make up our genetic code  but that code  by itself  our DNA  is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code without having a computer that can read it. It's like having an app without having a smartphone. We needed to have a way of bringing the biology to that incredible data  and the way to do that was to find a stand in  a biological stand in  that could contain all of the genetic information  but have it be arrayed in such a way as it could be read together and actually create this incredible avatar. We need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub types that represent who we are. So this is what we've built. It's an automated robotic technology. It has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands of stem cell lines. It's genetically arrayed. It has massively parallel processing capability  and it's going to change the way drugs are discovered  we hope  and I think eventually what's going to happen is that we're going to want to re screen drugs  on arrays like this  that already exist  all of the drugs that currently exist  and in the future  you're going to be taking drugs and treatments that have been tested for side effects on all of the relevant cells  on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells. It really has brought us to the threshold of personalized medicine. It's here now  and in our family  my son has type   diabetes  which is still an incurable disease  and I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer  but I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you  because probably a version of it is your story. At some point in our lives  all of us  or people we care about  become patients  and that's why I think that stem cell research is incredibly important for all of us. Thank you.  Applause \n",
      "Good morning everybody. I work with really amazing  little  itty bitty creatures called cells. And let me tell you what it's like to grow these cells in the lab. I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment. We plate them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes. And we feed them    sterilely of course    with what we call cell culture media    which is like their food    and we grow them in incubators. Why do I do this  We observe the cells in a plate  and they're just on the surface. But what we're really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tissues out of them. What does that even mean  Well it means growing an actual heart  let's say  or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body. Not only that  but they can also be used for disease models. And for this purpose  traditional cell culture techniques just really aren't enough. The cells are kind of homesick  the dish doesn't feel like their home. And so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive. We call this the biomimetic paradigm    copying nature in the lab. Let's take the example of the heart  the topic of a lot of my research. What makes the heart unique  Well  the heart beats  rhythmically  tirelessly  faithfully. We copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes. These electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab. What else do we know about the heart  Well  heart cells are pretty greedy. Nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very  very dense blood supply. In the lab  we micro pattern channels in the biomaterials on which we grow the cells  and this allows us to flow the cell culture media  the cells' food  through the scaffolds where we're growing the cells    a lot like what you might expect from a capillary bed in the heart. So this brings me to lesson number one  life can do a lot with very little. Let's take the example of electrical stimulation. Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be. On the left  we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue that I engineered from rat cells in the lab. It's about the size of a mini marshmallow. And after one week  it's beating. You can see it in the upper left hand corner. But don't worry if you can't see it so well. It's amazing that these cells beat at all. But what's really amazing is that the cells  when we electrically stimulate them  like with a pacemaker  that they beat so much more. But that brings me to lesson number two  cells do all the work. In a sense  tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here  because structural engineers build bridges and big things  computer engineers  computers  but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves. What does this mean for us  Let's do something really simple. Let's remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept. Let's remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way.  We are what we eat   could easily be described as   We are what our cells eat.  And in the case of the flora in our gut  these cells may not even be human. But it's also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life. Behind every sound  sight  touch  taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us. It begs the question  shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies  I invite you to talk about this with me further  and in the meantime  I wish you luck. May none of your non cancer cells become endangered species. Thank you.\n",
      "This is actually a painting that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School. And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted. In the front  you see  actually  Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant  while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison  the Chief of Urology at Harvard  actually harvesting the kidney. The kidney was indeed the first organ ever to be transplanted to the human. That was back in          years ago. Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago. Certainly many advances  many lives saved. But we have a major shortage of organs. In the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled. While  at the same time  the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat. That really has to do with our aging population. We're just getting older. Medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive. But as we age  our organs tend to fail more. So  that's a challenge  not just for organs but also for tissues. Trying to replace pancreas  trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's. These are major issues. This is actually a very stunning statistic. Every    seconds a patient dies from diseases that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement. So  what can we do about it  We've talked about stem cells tonight. That's a way to do it. But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients  in terms of actual therapies for organs. Wouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate  Wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies  to actually heal ourselves  It's not really that foreign of a concept  actually  it happens on the Earth every day. This is actually a picture of a salamander. Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate. You see here a little video. This is actually a limb injury in this salamander. And this is actually real photography  timed photography  showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days. You see the scar form. And that scar actually grows out a new limb. So  salamanders can do it. Why can't we  Why can't humans regenerate  Actually  we can regenerate. Your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day. As you age  as you get older. Your bones regenerate every    years. Your skin regenerates every two weeks. So  your body is constantly regenerating. The challenge occurs when there is an injury. At the time of injury or disease  the body's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body. It basically wants to fight off infection  and seal itself  whether it's organs inside your body  or your skin  the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in  to seal itself off from the outside. So  how can we harness that power  One of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials. How does this work  Well  on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured. This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body. And you see that it is injured. We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge. If you build that bridge  and you close off from the outside environment  then you can create that bridge  and cells that regenerate in your body  can then cross that bridge  and take that path. That's exactly what you see here. It's actually a smart biomaterial that we used  to actually treat this patient. This was an injured urethra on the left side. We used that biomaterial in the middle. And then  six months later on the right hand side you see this reengineered urethra. Turns out your body can regenerate  but only for small distances. The maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter. So  we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps. So  we do regenerate  but for limited distances. What do we do now  if you have injury for larger organs  What do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter  Then we can start to use cells. The strategy here  is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ  you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ  less than half the size of a postage stamp  you can then tease that tissue apart  and look at its basic components  the patient's own cells  you take those cells out  grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities  and then we then use scaffold materials. To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse  or your shirt  but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body. It disintegrates a few months later. It's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle. It's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue  and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away. And that's what we did for this piece of muscle. This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle. We take the cells  we expand them  we place the cells on the scaffold  and we then place the scaffold back into the patient. But actually  before placing the scaffold into the patient  we actually exercise it. We want to make sure that we condition this muscle  so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient. That's what you're seeing here. You're seeing this muscle bio reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth. Okay. These are flat structures that we see here  the muscle. What about other structures  This is actually an engineered blood vessel. Very similar to what we just did  but a little bit more complex. Here we take a scaffold  and we basically    scaffold can be like a piece of paper here. And we can then tubularize this scaffold. And what we do is we  to make a blood vessel  same strategy. A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types. We take muscle cells  we paste  or coat the outside with these muscle cells  very much like baking a layer cake  if you will. You place the muscle cells on the outside. You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside. You now have your fully seeded scaffold. You're going to place this in an oven like device. It has the same conditions as a human body     degrees centigrade     percent oxygen. You then exercise it  as what you saw on that tape. And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered. This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain. And this is an X ray showing you the patent  functional blood vessel. More complex structures such as blood vessels  urethras  which I showed you  they're definitely more complex because you're introducing two different cell types. But they are really acting mostly as conduits. You're allowing fluid or air to go through at steady states. They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs. Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity  because you're asking these organs to act on demand. So  the bladder is one such organ. Same strategy  we take a very small piece of the bladder  less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components  muscle  and these bladder specialized cells. We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities. It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ. We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder. We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells. We coat the outside with these muscle cells. We place it back into this oven like device. From the time you take that piece of tissue  six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient. This actually shows the scaffold. The material is actually being coated with the cells. When we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient. We brought patients in  six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery  did X rays  and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size pelvic cavity. For the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes  small  medium  large and extra large. It's true. And I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra large. Right  So  bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures. But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it. This is actually a heart valve  which we engineered. And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy. We take the scaffold  we seed it with cells  and you can now see here  the valve leaflets opening and closing. We exercise these prior to implantation. Same strategy. And then the most complex are the solid organs. For solid organs  they're more complex because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter. This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear. It's now being seeded with cartilage. That's the oven like device  once it's coated it gets placed there. And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold. This is actually digits that we're engineering. These are being layered  one layer at a time  first the bone  we fill in the gaps with cartilage. We then start adding the muscle on top. And you start layering these solid structures. Again  fairly more complex organs  but by far  the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized  highly vascularized  a lot of blood vessel supply  organs such as the heart  the liver  the kidneys. This is actually an example    several strategies to engineer solid organs. This is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer. And instead of using ink  we use    you just saw an inkjet cartridge    we just use cells. This is actually your typical desktop printer. It's actually printing this two chamber heart  one layer at a time. You see the heart coming out there. It takes about    minutes to print  and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract. This technology was developed by Tao Ju  who worked at our institute. And this is actually still  of course  experimental  not for use in patients. Another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs. We actually take donor organs  organs that are discarded  and we then can use very mild detergents to take all the cell elements out of these organs. So  for example on the left panel  top panel  you see a liver. We actually take the donor liver  we use very mild detergents  and we  by using these mild detergents  we take all the cells out of the liver. Two weeks later  we basically can lift this organ up  it feels like a liver  we can hold it like a liver  it looks like a liver  but it has no cells. All we are left with is the skeleton  if you will  of the liver  all made up of collagen  a material that's in our bodies  that will not reject. We can use it from one patient to the next. We then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply. You can see  actually that's a fluoroscopy. We're actually injecting contrast into the organ. Now you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver. And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact. We then take the cells  the vascular cells  blood vessel cells  we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient's own cells. We perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient's own liver cells. And we can then create functional livers. And that's actually what you're seeing. This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure  experimentally. For the kidney  as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw  the first slide I showed you     percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney     percent. So  another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together  like an accordion  if you will. So  we stack these wafers together  using the kidney cells. And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered. They are actually making urine. Again  small structures  our challenge is how to make them larger  and that is something we're working on right now at the institute. One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine. If at all possible  we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs. We are limited with distances right now  but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time. If we cannot use smart biomaterials  then we'd rather use your very own cells. Why  Because they will not reject. We can take cells from you  create the structure  put it right back into you  they will not reject. And if possible  we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ. If you present with a diseased wind pipe we'd like to take cells from your windpipe. If you present with a diseased pancreas we'd like to take cells from that organ. Why  Because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want. A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell. We don't need to teach it to become another cell type. So  we prefer organ specific cells. And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body  except for several which we still need stem cells for  like heart  liver  nerve and pancreas. And for those we still need stem cells. If we cannot use stem cells from your body then we'd like to use donor stem cells. And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors. And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago  stem cells from the amniotic fluid  and the placenta  which have those properties. So  at this point  I do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have. You know  I just showed you this presentation  everything looks so good  everything works. Actually no  these technologies really are not that easy. Some of the work you saw today was performed by over     researchers at our institute across a    year time span. So  these are very tough technologies. Once you get the formula right you can replicate it. But it takes a lot to get there. So  I always like to show this cartoon. This is how to stop a runaway stage. And there you see the stagecoach driver  and he goes  on the top panel  He goes A  B  C  D  E  F. He finally stops the runaway stage. And those are usually the basic scientists  The bottom is usually the surgeons. I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny. But actually method A is the correct approach. And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies to the clinic  we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients. And when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question. Are you ready to place this in your own loved one  your own child  your own family member  and then we proceed. Because our main goal  of course  is first  to do no harm. I'm going to show you now  a very short clip  It's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs. We started implanting some of these structures over    years ago. So  we have patients now walking around with organs  engineered organs  for over    years  as well. I'm going to show a clip of one young lady. She had a spina bifida defect  a spinal cord abnormality. She did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN. We are just taking five seconds. This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of. Video  Kaitlyn M  I'm happy. I was always afraid that I was going to have like  an accident or something. And now I can just go and go out with my friends  go do whatever I want. Anthony Atala  See  at the end of the day  the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise. And that is really very simple  to make our patients better. Thank you for your attention.\n",
      "There's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs. The fact is that we're living longer. Medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer  and the problem is  as we age  our organs tend to fail more  and so currently there are not enough organs to go around. In fact  in the last    years  the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled  while in the same time  the actual number of transplants has barely gone up. So this is now a public health crisis. So that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine. It really involves many different areas. You can use  actually  scaffolds  biomaterials    they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt    but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate. Or we can use cells alone  either your very own cells or different stem cell populations. Or we can use both. We can use  actually  biomaterials and the cells together. And that's where the field is today. But it's actually not a new field. Interestingly  this is a book that was published back in     . It's titled  The Culture of Organs.  The first author  Alexis Carrel  a Nobel Prize winner. He actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels  and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today were actually designed by Alexis. But I want you to note his co author  Charles Lindbergh. That's the same Charles Lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with Alexis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the area of the culture of organs. So if the field's been around for so long  why so few clinical advances  And that really has to do to many different challenges. But if I were to point to three challenges  the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time. And many advances now  we can do that fairly readily. The second challenge was cells. We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body. Over the last    years  we've basically tackled that. Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells. Plus we have stem cells. But even now        there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient. Liver cells  nerve cells  pancreatic cells    we still can't grow them even today. And the third challenge is vascularity  the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them. So we can actually use biomaterials now. This is actually a biomaterial. We can weave them  knit them  or we can make them like you see here. This is actually like a cotton candy machine. You saw the spray going in. That was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure  this tubularized structure  which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so. And that's exactly what we did here. This is actually a patient who  was  presented with a deceased organ  and we then created one of these smart biomaterials  and then we then used that smart biomaterial to replace and repair that patient's structure. What we did was we actually used the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge  if you will  and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue. And you see that patient now six months after with an X ray showing you the regenerated tissue  which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope. We can also use cells alone. These are actually cells that we obtained. These are stem cells that we create from specific sources  and we can drive them to become heart cells  and they start beating in culture. So they know what to do. The cells genetically know what to do  and they start beating together. Now today  many clinical trials are using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease. So that's actually now in patients. Or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures  we can then use the patient's own cells  or some cell population  and the biomaterials  the scaffolds  together. So the concept here  so if you do have a deceased or injured organ  we take a very small piece of that tissue  less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then tease the cells apart  we grow the cells outside the body. We then take a scaffold  a biomaterial    again  looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt    we then shape that material  and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time    very much like baking a layer cake  if you will. We then place it in an oven like device  and we're able to create that structure and bring it out. This is actually a heart valve that we've engineered  and you can see here  we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seeded that with cells  and then we exercise it. So you see the leaflets opening and closing    of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to further studies. Another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders. We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient    less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then grow the cells outside the body  take the scaffold  coat the scaffold with the cells    the patient's own cells  two different cell types. We then put it in this oven like device. It has the same conditions as the human body       degrees centigrade     percent oxygen. A few weeks later  you have your engineered organ that we're able to implant back into the patient. For these specific patients  we actually just suture these materials. We use three dimensional imagining analysis  but we actually created these biomaterials by hand. But we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells. We use now some type of technologies  where for solid organs  for example  like the liver  what we do is we take discard livers. As you know  a lot of organs are actually discarded  not used. So we can take these liver structures  which are not going to be used  and we then put them in a washing machine like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away. Two weeks later  you have something that looks like a liver. You can hold it like a liver  but it has no cells  it's just a skeleton of the liver. And we then can re perfuse the liver with cells  preserving the blood vessel tree. So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells  and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells. And we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology. Another technology that we've used is actually that of printing. This is actually a desktop inkjet printer  but instead of using ink  we're using cells. And you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure  and it takes about    minutes to print this structure. And there's a  D elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through. And then finally you're able to get that structure out. You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it. And this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implanted as you see here. That was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques. Another more advanced technology we're looking at right now  our next generation of technologies  are more sophisticated printers. This particular printer we're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient. So what you see here    I know it sounds funny  but that's the way it works. Because in reality  what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound  and you have a scanner  basically like a flatbed scanner. That's what you see here on the right side. You see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the printheads actually printing the layers that you require on the patients themselves. This is how it actually works. Here's the scanner going through  scanning the wound. Once it's scanned  it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be. And now you're going to see here a demo of this actually being done in a representative wound. And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material. So once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be. And this is actually new technology still under development. We're also working on more sophisticated printers. Because in reality  our biggest challenge are the solid organs. I don't know if you realize this  but    percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney. Patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around. So this is more challenging    large organ  vascular  a lot of blood vessel supply  a lot of cells present. So the strategy here is    this is actually a CT scan  an X ray    and we go layer by layer  using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and  D reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys. We then are able to actually image those  do     degree rotation to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics  and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form. So we go layer by layer through the organ  analyzing each layer as we go through the organ  and we then are able to send that information  as you see here  through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient. This actually shows the actual printer. And this actually shows that printing. In fact  we actually have the printer right here. So while we've been talking today  you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage. That's actually the actual printer right now  and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here. It takes about seven hours to print a kidney  so this is about three hours into it now. And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now  and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we printed a little bit earlier today. Put a pair of gloves here. Thank you. Go backwards. So  these gloves are a little bit small on me  but here it is. You can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today. Has a little bit of consistency to it. This is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project  and part of our team. Thank you  Dr. Kang. I appreciate it. So this is actually a new generation. This is actually the printer that you see here onstage. And this is actually a new technology we're working on now. In reality  we now have a long history of doing this. I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while. And this is actually a very brief clip    only about    seconds    of a patient who actually received an organ. I was missing school. It was pretty much miserable. I couldn't go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside. I felt so sick. I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis  and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that. So after the surgery  life got a lot better for me. I was able to do more things. I was able to wrestle in high school. I became the captain of the team  and that was great. I was able to be a normal kid with my friends. And because they used my own cells to build this bladder  it's going to be with me. I've got it for life  so I'm all set. Juan Enriquez  These experiments sometimes work  and it's very cool when they do. Luke  come up please. So Luke  before last night  when's the last time you saw Tony  LM  Ten years ago  when I had my surgery    and it's really great to see him. JE  And tell us a little bit about what you're doing. LM  Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut. I'm a sophomore and studying communications  TV and mass media  and basically trying to live life like a normal kid  which I always wanted growing up. But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working. I went through about    surgeries  and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was   . And this surgery came along and basically made me who I am today and saved my life. JE  And Tony's done hundreds of these  LM  What I know from  he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff. I know I was one of the first    people to have this surgery. And when I was     I didn't realize how amazing it was. I was a little kid  and I was like   Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery.  All I wanted to do was to get better  and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing. JE  When you got this call out of the blue    Tony's really shy  and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke. So Luke  you go to your communications professors    you're majoring in communications    and you ask them for permission to come to TED  which might have a little bit to do with communications  and what was their reaction  LM  Most of my professors were all for it  and they said   Bring pictures and show me the clips online   and  I'm happy for you.  There were a couple that were a little stubborn  but I had to talk to them. I pulled them aside. JE  Well  it's an honor and a privilege to meet you. Thank you so much.  LM  Thank you so much.  JE  Thank you  Tony.\n",

      "water river drinking waste stream desert lake sanitation dry algae\n",
      "Our grandparents' generation created an amazing system of canals and reservoirs that made it possible for people to live in places where there wasn't a lot of water. For example  during the Great Depression  they created the Hoover Dam  which in turn  created Lake Mead and made it possible for the cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix and Los Angeles to provide water for people who lived in a really dry place. In the   th century  we literally spent trillions of dollars building infrastructure to get water to our cities. In terms of economic development  it was a great investment. But in the last decade  we've seen the combined effects of climate change  population growth and competition for water resources threaten these vital lifelines and water resources. This figure shows you the change in the lake level of Lake Mead that happened in the last    years. You can see starting around the year       the lake level started to drop. And it was dropping at such a rate that it would have left the drinking water intakes for Las Vegas high and dry. The city became so concerned about this that they recently constructed a new drinking water intake structure that they referred to as the  Third Straw  to pull water out of the greater depths of the lake. The challenges associated with providing water to a modern city are not restricted to the American Southwest. In the year       the third largest city in Australia  Brisbane  came within   months of running out of water. A similar drama is playing out today in S o Paulo  Brazil  where the main reservoir for the city has gone from being completely full in       to being nearly empty today as the city approaches the      Summer Olympics. For those of us who are fortunate enough to live in one of the world's great cities  we've never truly experienced the effects of a catastrophic drought. We like to complain about the navy showers we have to take. We like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns. But we've never really faced the prospect of turning on the tap and having nothing come out. And that's because when things have gotten bad in the past  it's always been possible to expand a reservoir or dig a few more groundwater wells. Well  in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for  it's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way of providing ourselves with water. Some people think that we're going to solve the urban water problem by taking water from our rural neighbors. But that's an approach that's fraught with political  legal and social dangers. And even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors  we're just transferring the problem to someone else and there's a good chance it will come back and bite us in the form of higher food prices and damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water. I think that there's a better way to solve our urban water crisis and I think that's to open up four new local sources of water that I liken to faucets. If we can make smart investments in these new sources of water in the coming years  we can solve our urban water problem and decrease the likelihood that we'll ever run across the effects of a catastrophic drought. Now  if you told me    years ago that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water  I probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer. But my own experiences working with some of the world's most water starved cities in the last decades have shown me that we have the technologies and the management skills to actually transition away from imported water  and that's what I want to tell you about tonight. The first source of local water supply that we need to develop to solve our urban water problem will flow with the rainwater that falls in our cities. One of the great tragedies of urban development is that as our cities grew  we started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asphalt. And when we did that  we had to build storm sewers to get the water that fell on the cities out before it could cause flooding  and that's a waste of a vital water resource. Let me give you an example. This figure here shows you the volume of water that could be collected in the city of San Jose if they could harvest the stormwater that fell within the city limits. You can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line that if San Jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city  they'd have enough water to get them through an entire year. Now  I know what some of you are probably thinking.  The answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks and attaching them to the downspouts of our roof gutters  rainwater harvesting.  Now  that's an idea that might work in some places. But if you live in a place where it mainly rains in the winter time and most of the water demand is in the summertime  it's not a very cost effective way to solve a water problem. And if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought  like California's currently experiencing  you just can't build a rainwater tank that's big enough to solve your problem. I think there's a lot more practical way to harvest the stormwater and the rainwater that falls in our cities  and that's to capture it and let it percolate into the ground. After all  many of our cities are sitting on top of a natural water storage system that can accommodate huge volumes of water. For example  historically  Los Angeles has obtained about a third of its water supply from a massive aquifer that underlies the San Fernando Valley. Now  when you look at the water that comes off of your roof and runs off of your lawn and flows down the gutter  you might say to yourself   Do I really want to drink that stuff   Well  the answer is you don't want to drink it until it's been treated a little bit. And so the challenge that we face in urban water harvesting is to capture the water  clean the water and get it underground. And that's exactly what the city of Los Angeles is doing with a new project that they're building in Burbank  California. This figure here shows the stormwater park that they're building by hooking a series of stormwater collection systems  or storm sewers  and routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry. The water that's captured in the quarry is slowly passed through a man made wetland  and then it goes into that ball field there and percolates into the ground  recharging the drinking water aquifer of the city. And in the process of passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground  the water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil  and that purifies the water. And if the water's still not clean enough to drink after it's been through this natural treatment process  the city can treat it again when they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers before they deliver it to people to drink. The second tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with the wastewater that comes out of our sewage treatment plants. Now  many of you are probably familiar with the concept of recycled water. You've probably seen signs like this that tell you that the shrubbery and the highway median and the local golf course is being watered with water that used to be in a sewage treatment plant. We've been doing this for a couple of decades now. But what we're learning from our experience is that this approach is much more expensive that we expected it to be. Because once we build the first few water recycling systems close to the sewage treatment plant  we have to build longer and longer pipe networks to get that water to where it needs to go. And that becomes prohibitive in terms of cost. What we're finding is that a much more cost effective and practical way of recycling wastewater is to turn treated wastewater into drinking water through a two step process. In the first step in this process we pressurize the water and pass it through a reverse osmosis membrane  a thin  permeable plastic membrane that allows water molecules to pass through but traps and retains the salts  the viruses and the organic chemicals that might be present in the wastewater. In the second step in the process  we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and shine ultraviolet light on the water. The ultraviolet light cleaves the hydrogen peroxide into two parts that are called hydroxyl radicals  and these hydroxyl radicals are very potent forms of oxygen that break down most organic chemicals. After the water's been through this two stage process  it's safe to drink. I know  I've been studying recycled water using every measurement technique known to modern science for the past    years. We've detected some chemicals that can make it through the first step in the process  but by the time we get to the second step  the advanced oxidation process  we rarely see any chemicals present. And that's in stark contrast to the taken for granted water supplies that we regularly drink all the time. There's another way we can recycle water. This is an engineered treatment wetland that we recently built on the Santa Ana River in Southern California. The treatment wetland receives water from a part of the Santa Ana River that in the summertime consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent from cities like Riverside and San Bernardino. The water comes into our treatment wetland  it's exposed to sunlight and algae and those break down the organic chemicals  remove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens. The water gets put back in the Santa Ana River  it flows down to Anaheim  gets taken out at Anaheim and percolated into the ground  and becomes the drinking water of the city of Anaheim  completing the trip from the sewers of Riverside County to the drinking water supply of Orange County. Now  you might think that this idea of drinking wastewater is some sort of futuristic fantasy or not commonly done. Well  in California  we already recycle about    billion gallons a year of wastewater through the two stage advanced treatment process I was telling you about. That's enough water to be the supply of about a million people if it were their sole water supply. The third tap that we need to open up will not be a tap at all  it will be a kind of virtual tap  it will be the water conservation that we manage to do. And the place where we need to think about water conservation is outdoors because in California and other modern American cities  about half of our water use happens outdoors. In the current drought  we've seen that it's possible to have our lawns survive and our plants survive with about half as much water. So there's no need to start painting concrete green and putting in Astroturf and buying cactuses. We can have California friendly landscaping with soil moisture detectors and smart irrigation controllers and have beautiful green landscapes in our cities. The fourth and final water tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with desalinated seawater. Now  I know what you probably heard people say about seawater desalination.  It's a great thing to do if you have lots of oil  not a lot of water and you don't care about climate change.  Seawater desalination is energy intensive no matter how you slice it. But that characterization of seawater desalination as being a nonstarter is hopelessly out of date. We've made tremendous progress in seawater desalination in the past two decades. This picture shows you the largest seawater desalination plant in the Western hemisphere that's currently being built north of San Diego. Compared to the seawater desalination plant that was built in Santa Barbara    years ago  this treatment plant will use about half the energy to produce a gallon of water. But just because seawater desalination has become less energy intensive  doesn't mean we should start building desalination plants everywhere. Among the different choices we have  it's probably the most energy intensive and potentially environmentally damaging of the options to create a local water supply. So there it is. With these four sources of water  we can move away from our reliance on imported water. Through reform in the way we landscape our surfaces and our properties  we can reduce outdoor water use by about    percent  thereby increasing  the water supply by    percent. We can recycle the water that makes it into the sewer  thereby increasing our water supply by    percent. And we can make up the difference through a combination of stormwater harvesting and seawater desalination. So  let's create a water supply that will be able to withstand any of the challenges that climate change throws at us in the coming years. Let's create a water supply that uses local sources and leaves more water in the environment for fish and for food. Let's create a water system that's consistent with out environmental values. And let's do it for our children and our grandchildren and let's tell them this is the system that they have to take care of in the future because it's our last chance to create a new kind of water system. Thank you very much for your attention.\n",
      "This is a river. This is a stream. This is a river. This is happening all over the country. There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States. On this map  the colored areas represent water conflicts. Similar problems are emerging in the east as well. The reasons vary state to state  but mostly in the details. There are       miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone. They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife. They're the veins of the ecosystem  and they're often empty veins. I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it's an archetype for the larger story. This is Prickly Pear Creek. It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena. It supports wild fish including cutthroat  brown and rainbow trout. Nearly every year for more than a hundred years  it's looked like this in the summer. How did we get here  Well  it started back in the late     s when people started settling in places like Montana. In short  there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people. But as more people showed up wanting water  the folks who were there first got a little concerned  and in       Montana passed its first water law. It basically said  everybody near the stream can share in the stream. Oddly  a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream  and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers. There were precedent setting suits in      and       both involving Prickly Pear Creek. And in       the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear that the folks who were there first had the first  or  senior water rights.  These senior water rights are key. The problem is that all over the west now it looks like this. Some of these creeks have claims for    to     times more water than is actually in the stream. And the senior water rights holders  if they don't use their water right  they risk losing their water right  along with the economic value that goes with it. So they have no incentive to conserve. So it's not just about the number of people  the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don't use it. So after decades of lawsuits and     years  now  of experience  we still have this. It's a broken system. There's a disincentive to conserve  because  if you don't use your water right  you can lose your water right. And I'm sure you all know  this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities. Okay. Now I'm going to change gears here. Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free  and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer. There's another thing happening around the country  which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint. They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water  they're trying to be really efficient with their water use  and they're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand. Well  it's a national problem  but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana  and it involves beer. I bet you didn't know  it takes about   pints of water to make a pint of beer. If you include all the drain  it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer. Now the brewers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption  but they still use millions of gallons of water. I mean  there's water in beer. So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem  These ecosystems are really important to the Montana brewers and their customers. After all  there's a strong correlation between water and fishing  and for some  there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer. So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned  and they're looking for some way to address the problem. So how can they address this remaining water footprint  Remember Prickly Pear. Up until now  business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing  and we're suggesting that the next step is to restore. Remember Prickly Pear. It's a broken system. You've got a disincentive to conserve  because if you don't use your water right  you risk losing your water right. Well  we decided to connect these two worlds    the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks. In some states  senior water rights holders can leave their water in stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right. After all  it is their water right  and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream  it's their right to do so. But they have no incentive to do so. So  working with local water trusts  we created an incentive to do so. We pay them to leave their water in stream. That's what's happening here. This individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion  leaving the water in the stream. He doesn't lose the water right  he just chooses to apply that right  or some portion of it  to the stream  instead of to the land. Because he's the senior water rights holder  he can protect the water from other users in the stream. Okay  He gets paid to leave the water in the stream. This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream. We then take the measured water  we divide it into thousand gallon increments. Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate  and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems. The brewers pay to restore water to the stream. It provides a simple  inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems  while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them. After     years of conflict and     years of dry streams  a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved  we put together a market based  willing buyer  willing seller solution    a solution that does not require litigation. It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed  into these degraded ecosystems  while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used. These transactions create allies  not enemies. They connect people rather than dividing them. And they provide needed economic support for rural communities. And most importantly  it's working. We've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems. We've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in Montana  with hotels and tea companies in Oregon and with high tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest. And when we make these connections  we can and we do turn this into this. Thank you very much.\n",
      "For emotions  we should not move quickly to the desert. So  first  a small housekeeping announcement  please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain. So  welcome to the Golden Desert  Indian desert. It receives the least rainfall in the country  lowest rainfall. If you are well versed with inches  nine inches  centimeters      centimeters . The groundwater is     feet deep      meters. And in most parts it is saline  not fit for drinking. So  you can't install hand pumps or dig wells  though there is no electricity in most of the villages. But suppose you use the green technology  solar pumps    they are of no use in this area. So  welcome to the Golden Desert. Clouds seldom visit this area. But we find    different names of clouds in this dialect used here. There are a number of techniques to harvest rain. This is a new work  it's a new program. But for the desert society this is no program  this is their life. And they harvest rain in many ways. So  this is the first device they use in harvesting rain. It's called kunds  somewhere it is called  unclear . And you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment. The desert is there  sand dunes  some small field. And this is all big raised platform. You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment  and there is a slope. Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms  but here they will care properly. And the water will go where it should go. And then it is    feet deep. The waterproofing is done perfectly  better than our city contractors  because not a single drop should go waste in this. They collect     thousand liters in one season. And this is pure drinking water. Below the surface there is hard saline water. But now you can have this for year round. It's two houses. We often use a term called bylaws. Because we are used to get written things. But here it is unwritten by law. And people made their house  and the water storage tanks. These raised up platforms just like this stage. In fact they go    feet deep  and collect rain water from roof  there is a small pipe  and from their courtyard. It can also harvest something like        in a good monsoon. Another big one  this is of course out of the hardcore desert area. This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort. And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season. The age is     years. So  since     years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season. You can calculate the price of that water. It draws water from    kilometers of canals. You can see a modern road  hardly    years old. It can break sometimes. But this     year old canal  which draws water  it is maintained for so many generations. Of course if you want to go inside  the two doors are locked. But they can be opened for TED people. And we request them. You can see person coming up with two canisters of water. And the water level    these are not empty canisters    water level is right up to this. It can envy many municipalities  the color  the taste  the purity of this water. And this is what they call Zero B type of water  because it comes from the clouds  pure distilled water. We stop for a quick commercial break  and then we come back to the traditional systems. The government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas. That's why I said that this is a commercial break. But we will come back  once again  to the traditional thing. So  water from          kilometers away  soon it become like this. In many portions  water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything. Of course there are some areas where water is reaching  I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all. But the tail end  the Jaisalmer area  you will notice in Bikaner things like this  where the water hyacinth couldn't grow  the sand is flowing in these canals. The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it. We had full page advertisements  some    years     years ago when this canal came. They said that throw away your traditional systems  these new cement tanks will supply you piped water. It's a dream. And it became a dream also. Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas. And people started renovating their own structures. These are all traditional water structures  which we won't be able to explain in such a short time. But you can see that no woman is standing on those. And they are plaiting hair. Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert. This town was established     years ago. I'm not sure by that time Bombay was there  or Delhi was there  or Chennai was there  or Bangalore was there. So  this was the terminal point for silk route. Well connected      years ago  through Europe. None of us were able to go to Europe  but Jaisalmer was well connected to it. And this is the    centimeter area. Such a limited rainfall  and highest colorful life flourished in these areas. You won't find water in this slide. But it is invisible. Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here. Or  if you want to paint  you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms. But apart from this system  they designed    beautiful water bodies around this town. And what we call private public partnership you can add estate also. So  estate  public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body. And it's a kind of water body for all seasons. You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year. Whether water level goes up or down  the beauty is there throughout. Another water body  dried up  of course  during the summer period  but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics  with the heart. These statues  marvelous statues  gives you an idea of water table. When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank  it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today  mass communication.  This was for mass communication. Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned  so water will be there for seven months or nine months  or    months. And then they will come and worship this pond  pay respect  their gratitude. Another small water body  called the  unclear . It is difficult to translate in English  especially in my English. But the nearest would be  glory   a reputation. The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up. In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up. And perhaps they knew the future also. It was designed some     years ago. But perhaps they knew that on sixth  November        there will be a TED green and blue session  so they painted it like this. Dry water body. Children are standing on a very difficult device to explain. This is called kund. We have  in English  surface water and ground water. But this is not ground water. You can draw ground water from any well. But this is no ordinary well. It squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand. And they have dubbed this water as the third one called  unclear . And there is a gypsum belt running below it. And it was deposited by the great mother Earth  some three million years ago. And where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water. This is the same dry water body. Now  you don't find any kund  they are all submerged. But when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year. This year they have received only six centimeters. Six centimeter of rainfall  and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city  Delhi  Bombay  Bangalore  Mysore  please come to our area of six centimeters  we can give you water. How they maintain them  There are three things  concept  planning  making the actual thing  and also maintaining them. It is a structure for maintain  for centuries  by generations  without any department  without any funding  So the secret is   unclear    respect. Your own thing  not personal property  my property  every time. So  these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area. Don't spit  don't do anything wrong  so that the clean water can be collected. Another pillar  stone pillar on your right side. If you climb these three  six steps you will find something very nice. This was done in   th century. And you have to go further down. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words  so we can say a thousand words right now  an another thousand words. If the water table goes down  you will find new stairs. If it comes up  some of them will be submerged. So  throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure. Three sides  such steps  on the fourth side there is a four story building where you can organize such TED conferences anytime. Excuse me  who built these structures  They are in front of you. The best civil engineers we had  the best planners  the best architects. We can say that because of them  because of their forefathers  India could get the first engineering college in     . There were no English medium schools at that time  even no Hindi schools   unclear  schools. But such people  compelled to the East India Company  which came here for business  a very dirty kind of business ... but not to create the engineering colleges. But because of them  first engineering college was created in a small village  not in the town. The last point  we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert. So  you can find through your Jeep  a camel  and a cart. This tire comes from the airplane. So  look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater  and also create something through a tire from a jet plane  and used in a camel cart. Last picture  it's a tattoo        years old tattoo. They were using it on their body. Tattoo was  at one time  a kind of a blacklisted or con thing  but now it is in thing. You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this. The center of life is water. These are the beautiful waves. These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides. These are the trees. And these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives. So  this is the message of desert. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So  first of all  I wish I had your eloquence  truly  in any language. These artifacts and designs are inspiring. Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere  that the world can learn from this  Or is this just right for this place  Anupam Mishra  No  the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area. So  the ponds  the open bodies  are everywhere  right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir  and in other parts also. And these  unclear   which stored water  there are two type of things. One recharge  and one stores. So  it depends on the terrain. But kund  which uses the gypsum belt  for that you have to go back to your calendar  three million years ago. If it is there it can be done right now. Otherwise  it can't be done. CA  Thank you so much.\n",
      "Good morning everybody. I'd like to talk about a couple of things today. The first thing is water. Now I see you've all been enjoying the water that's been provided for you here at the conference  over the past couple of days. And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source. But what if it wasn't  What if it was from a source like this  Then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea. I talked a lot in the past about statistics  and the provision of safe drinking water for all. But they just don't seem to get through. And I think I've worked out why. It's because  using current thinking  the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving. So we just switch off  us  governments and aid agencies. Well  today  I'd like to show you that through thinking differently  the problem has been solved. By the way  since I've been speaking  another        people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea. And four children have just died. I invented Lifesaver bottle because I got angry. I  like most of you  was sitting down  the day after Christmas in       when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in  playing out on TV. The days and weeks that followed  people fleeing to the hills  being forced to drink contaminated water or face death. That really stuck with me. Then  a few months later  Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.  Okay   I thought   here's a First World country  let's see what they can do.  Day one  nothing. Day two  nothing. Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome  People were shooting each other on the streets for TV sets and water. That's when I decided I had to do something. Now I spent a lot of time in my garage  over the next weeks and months  and also in my kitchen    much to the dismay of my wife.  Laughter  However  after a few failed prototypes  I finally came up with this  the Lifesaver bottle. Okay  now for the science bit. Before Lifesaver  the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about     nanometers. The smallest bacteria is about     nanometers. So a     nanometer bacteria is going to get through a     nanometer hole. The smallest virus  on the other hand  is about    nanometers. So that's definitely going to get through those     nanometer holes. Lifesaver pores are    nanometers. So nothing is getting through. Okay  I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration. Would you like to see that  I spent all the time setting this up  so I guess I should. We're in the fine city of Oxford. So    someone's done that up. Fine city of Oxford  so what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell  and the River Thames  that flow through here. And this is the water. But I got to thinking  you know  if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh  the water wouldn't look like this. So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it. And this is from my pond. Okay.  Laughs  Right. We're just going to pour that in there. Audience  Ugh  Michael Pritchard  Okay. We've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm. So I'm just going to put that in there. Put that in there. There we go. And some other bits and pieces  chuck that in there. And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit. So we're just going to put that in there as well. Okay.  Laughter  Now. The Lifesaver bottle works really simply. You just scoop the water up. Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there. That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit. Okay  so I'm going to take this really filthy water  and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet  Okay. There we go. Replace the top. Give it a few pumps. Okay  That's all that's necessary. Now as soon as I pop the teat  sterile drinking water is going to come out. I've got to be quick. Okay  ready  There we go. Mind the electrics. That is safe  sterile drinking water. Cheers. There you go Chris. What's it taste of  Chris Anderson  Delicious. Michael Pritchard  Okay. Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay  Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world. It'll last for       liters. And when it's expired  using failsafe technology  the system will shut off  protecting the user. Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in. It's good for another       liters. So let's look at the applications. Traditionally  in a crisis  what do we do  We ship water. Then  after a few weeks  we set up camps. And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water. What happens when        people congregate in a camp  Diseases spread. More resources are required. The problem just becomes self perpetuating. But by thinking differently  and shipping these  people can stay put. They can make their own sterile drinking water  and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives. Now  it doesn't require a natural disaster for this to work. Using the old thinking  of national infrastructure and pipe work  is too expensive. When you run the numbers on a calculator  you run out of noughts. So here is the  thinking different  bit. Instead of shipping water  and using man made processes to do it  let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system. She picks the water up from there  desalinates it  for free  transports it over there  and dumps it onto the mountains  rivers  and streams. And where do people live  Near water. All we've go to do is make it sterile. How do we do that  Well  we could use the Lifesaver bottle. Or we could use one of these. The same technology  in a jerry can. This will process        liters of water  that's good enough for a family of four  for three years. And how much does it cost  About half a cent a day to run. Thank you. So  by thinking differently  and processing water at the point of use  mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water. They can get it from a source nearby. So with just eight billion dollars  we can hit the millennium goal's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water. To put that into context  The U.K. government spends about    billion pounds a year on foreign aid. But why stop there  With    billion dollars  everyone can have access to safe drinking water. So the three and a half billion people that suffer every year as a result  and the two million kids that die every year  will live. Thank you.\n",
      "I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at. You're about to experience a new  available and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives. What I have here is a cinder block that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material. It's called Ultra Ever Dry  and when you apply it to any material  it turns into a superhydrophobic shield. So this is a cinder block  uncoated  and you can see that it's porous  it absorbs water. Not anymore. Porous  nonporous. So what's superhydrophobic  Superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface. The rounder it is  the more hydrophobic it is  and if it's really round  it's superhydrophobic. A freshly waxed car  the water molecules slump to about    degrees. A windshield coating is going to give you about     degrees. But what you're seeing here is     to     degrees  and anything over     is superhydrophobic. So as part of the demonstration  what I have is a pair of gloves  and we've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating  and let's see if you can tell which one  and I'll give you a hint. Did you guess the one that was dry  When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience  what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits. And we're talking really small here. The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers  and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter  and to put some scale to that  if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick  and you put it side by side  and you had        of them  you'd be the width of a human hair. So very small  but very useful. And it's not just water that this works with. It's a lot of water based materials like concrete  water based paint  mud  and also some refined oils as well. You can see the difference. Moving onto the next demonstration  we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it  we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating  and we're going to pour this green tinted water inside the middle  and you're going to see  it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would  except when it hits the coating  it stops  and I can't even coax it to leave. It's that afraid of the water. So what's going on here  What's happening  Well  the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface. You'd think it'd be smooth  but it's actually not. And it has billions of interstitial spaces  and those spaces  along with the nanoparticles  reach up and grab the air molecules  and cover the surface with air. It's an umbrella of air all across it  and that layer of air is what the water hits  the mud hits  the concrete hits  and it glides right off. So if I put this inside this water here  you can see a silver reflective coating around it  and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle  and it's dry. So what are the applications  I mean  many of you right now are probably going through your head. Everyone that sees this gets excited  and says   Oh  I could use it for this and this and this.  The applications in a general sense could be anything that's anti wetting. We've certainly seen that today. It could be anything that's anti icing  because if you don't have water  you don't have ice. It could be anti corrosion. No water  no corrosion. It could be anti bacterial. Without water  the bacteria won't survive. And it could be things that need to be self cleaning as well. So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work. And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration  but before I do that  I would like to say thank you  and think small. It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.

      "The story starts  I was at a friend's house  and she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual  which is the manual of mental disorders. It lists every known mental disorder. And it used to be  back in the '  s  a very slim pamphlet. And then it got bigger and bigger and bigger  and now it's     pages long. And it lists currently     mental disorders. So I was leafing through it  wondering if I had any mental disorders  and it turns out I've got   . I've got generalized anxiety disorder  which is a given. I've got nightmare disorder  which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure  and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going   You're a failure   I've got parent child relational problems  which I blame my parents for. I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm kidding. And I've got malingering. And I think it's actually quite rare to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder  because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious. Anyway  I was looking through this book  wondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was  or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you're not a trained professional  or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder. I didn't know which of these was true  but I thought it was kind of interesting  and I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view  which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists. It was a man called Brian  who runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies. They're called the CCHR. And I said to him   Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo science that can't be trusted   And he said   Yes  we can prove it to you.  And I said   How   And he said   We're going to introduce you to Tony.  And I said   Who's Tony   And he said   Tony's in Broadmoor.  Now  Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. It's where they send the serial killers  and the people who can't help themselves. And I said to Brian   Well  what did Tony do   And he said   Hardly anything. He beat someone up or something  and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence. But he faked it too well  and now he's stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe he's sane. Do you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony   So I said   Yes  please.  So I got the train to Broadmoor. I began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park  which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious  they yawn uncontrollably. And we got to Broadmoor. And I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center  which is where you get to meet the patients. It looks like a giant Hampton Inn. It's all peach and pine and calming colors. And the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons. And the patients started drifting in. And they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants  and quite docile looking. And Brian the Scientologist whispered to me   They're medicated   which  to the Scientologists  is like the worst evil in the world  but I'm thinking it's probably a good idea. And then Brian said   Here's Tony.  And a man was walking in. And he wasn't overweight  he was in very good physical shape. And he wasn't wearing sweatpants  he was wearing a pinstripe suit. And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice. He looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane. And he sat down. And I said   So is it true that you faked your way in here   And he said   Yep. Yep. Absolutely. I beat someone up when I was   . And I was in prison awaiting trial  and my cellmate said to me  'You know what you have to do  Fake madness. Tell them you're mad  you'll get sent to some cushy hospital. Nurses will bring you pizzas  you'll have your own PlayStation.'  I said   Well  how did you do it   He said   Well  I asked to see the prison psychiatrist. And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash ' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist  'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.'  And I said   What else   He said   Oh  yeah. I told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died  because it would make me feel more normal.  I said   Where'd you get that from   He said   Oh  from a biography of Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library.  Anyway  he faked madness too well  he said. And they didn't send him to some cushy hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the minute he got there  said he took one look at the place  asked to see the psychiatrist  said   There's been a terrible misunderstanding. I'm not mentally ill.  I said   How long have you been here for   He said   Well  if I'd just done my time in prison for the original crime  I'd have got five years. I've been in Broadmoor for    years.  Tony said that it's a lot harder to convince people you're sane than it is to convince them you're crazy. He said   I thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what's on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist  and recently they had an article about how the U.S. Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse  'Did you know that the U.S. Army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives ' When I read my medical notes  I saw they'd written  'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'  He said   You know  they're always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state. But how do you sit in a sane way  How do you cross your legs in a sane way  It's just impossible.  When Tony said that to me  I thought to myself   Am I sitting like a journalist  Am I crossing my legs like a journalist   He said   You know  I've got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me  and I've got the 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' rapist on the other side of me. So I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening. And they take that as a sign of madness. They say it proves that I'm aloof and grandiose.  So  only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness. Anyway  he seemed completely normal to me  but what did I know  And when I got home I emailed his clinician  Anthony Maden. I said   What's the story   And he said   Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence  because his hallucinations    that had seemed quite cliche to begin with    just vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor. However  we have assessed him  and we've determined that what he is is a psychopath.  And in fact  faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath. It's on the checklist  cunning  manipulative. So  faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts  and they said the pinstripe suit    classic psychopath    speaks to items one and two on the checklist  glibness  superficial charm and grandiose sense of self worth. And I said   Well  but why didn't he hang out with the other patients   Classic psychopath    it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy. So all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony was evidence  according to his clinician  that he was mad in this new way. He was a psychopath. And his clinician said to me   If you want to know more about psychopaths  you can go on a psychopath spotting course run by Robert Hare  who invented the psychopath checklist.  So I did. I went on a psychopath spotting course  and I am now a certified    and I have to say  extremely adept    psychopath spotter. So  here's the statistics  One in a hundred regular people is a psychopath. So there's       people in his room. Fifteen of you are psychopaths. Although that figure rises to four percent of CEOs and business leaders  so I think there's a very good chance there's about    or    psychopaths in this room. It could be carnage by the end of the night. Hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior    the lack of empathy  the glibness  cunning  manipulative. In fact  capitalism  perhaps at its most remorseless  is a physical manifestation of psychopathy. It's like a form of psychopathy that's come down to affect us all. Hare said   You know what  Forget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness. Who cares  That's not a big story. The big story   he said   is corporate psychopathy. You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths.  So I gave it a try. I wrote to the Enron people. I said   Could I come and interview you in prison  to find out it you're psychopaths   And they didn't reply. So I changed tack. I emailed  Chainsaw Al  Dunlap  the asset stripper from the     s. He would come into failing businesses and close down    percent of the workforce  just turn American towns into ghost towns. And I emailed him and I said   I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you ... special  and interested in the predatory spirit  and fearless. Can I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly   And he said   Come on over   So I went to Al Dunlap's grand Florida mansion. It was filled with sculptures of predatory animals. There were lions and tigers    he was taking me through the garden    there were falcons and eagles  he was saying   Over there you've got sharks and     he was saying this in a less effeminate way     You've got more sharks and you've got tigers.  It was like Narnia. And then we went into his kitchen. Now  Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies  he'd close down    percent of the workforce. And he'd quite often fire people with a joke. Like  for instance  one famous story about him  somebody came up to him and said   I've just bought myself a new car.  And he said   Well  you may have a new car  but I'll tell you what you don't have    a job.  So in his kitchen    he was in there with his wife  Judy  and his bodyguard  Sean    and I said   You know how I said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special   He said   Yeah  it's an amazing theory  it's like Star Trek. You're going where no man has gone before.  And I said   Well      Clears throat  Some psychologists might say that this makes you      Mumbles  And he said   What   And I said   A psychopath.  And I said   I've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I go through them with you   And he looked intrigued despite himself  and he said   Okay  go on.  And I said   Okay. Grandiose sense of self worth.  Which I have to say  would have been hard for him to deny  because he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself. He said   Well  you've got to believe in you   And I said   Manipulative.  He said   That's leadership.  And I said   Shallow affect  an inability to experience a range of emotions.  He said   Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions   So he was going down the psychopath checklist  basically turning it into  Who Moved My Cheese   But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap. Whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal    like he said  no  to juvenile delinquency  he said he got accepted into West Point  and they don't let delinquents in West Point. He said  no  to many short term marital relationships. He's only ever been married twice. Admittedly  his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like  but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument  and his second marriage has lasted    years. So whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non psychopathic  I thought to myself  well I'm not going to put that in my book. And then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic. Because I was desperate to shove him in a box marked  Psychopath.  I was desperate to define him by his maddest edges. And I realized  my God    this is what I've been doing for    years. It's what all journalists do. We travel across the world with our notepads in our hands  and we wait for the gems. And the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee's personality. And we stitch them together like medieval monks  and we leave the normal stuff on the floor. And you know  this is a country that over diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely. Childhood bipolar    children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums  which scores them high on the bipolar checklist. When I got back to London  Tony phoned me. He said   Why haven't you been returning my calls   I said   Well  they say that you're a psychopath.  And he said   I'm not a psychopath.  He said   You know what  One of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse  but another item on the checklist is cunning  manipulative. So when you say you feel remorse for your crime  they say  'Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn't.' It's like witchcraft  they turn everything upside down.  He said   I've got a tribunal coming up. Will you come to it   So I said okay. So I went to his tribunal. And after    years in Broadmoor  they let him go. They decided that he shouldn't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism. So they let him go. And outside in the corridor he said to me   You know what  Jon  Everyone's a bit psychopathic.  He said   You are  I am. Well  obviously I am.  I said   What are you going to do now   He said   I'm going to go to Belgium. There's a woman there that I fancy. But she's married  so I'm going to have to get her split up from her husband.  Anyway  that was two years ago  and that's where my book ended. And for the last    months  everything was fine. Nothing bad happened. He was living with a girl outside London. He was  according to Brian the Scientologist  making up for lost time  which I know sounds ominous  but isn't necessarily ominous. Unfortunately  after    months  he did go back to jail for a month. He got into a  fracas  in a bar  he called it. Ended up going to jail for a month  which I know is bad  but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was  it wasn't too bad. And then he phoned me. And you know what  I think it's right that Tony is out. Because you shouldn't define people by their maddest edges. And what Tony is  is he's a semi psychopath. He's a gray area in a world that doesn't like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find the complexity. It's where you find the humanity  and it's where you find the truth. And Tony said to me   Jon  could I buy you a drink in a bar  I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me.  And I didn't go. What would you have done  Thank you.\n",
      "An    year old  African American male joined the United States Air Force and was assigned to Mountain Home  Air Force Base and was a part of the air police squadron. Upon first arriving there  the first goal that I had was for me to identify an apartment  so I could bring my wife  and my new baby  Melanie  out to join me in Idaho. I immediately went to  the personnel office  and talking with the guys in personnel  they said   Hey  no problem finding  an apartment in Mountain Home  Idaho. The people down there love us  because they know if they have an airman who is coming in to rent  one of their apartments  they'll always get their money.  And that was a really important thing. He said   So here is a list  of people that you can call  and then they will then allow you  to select the apartment that you want.  So I got the list  I made the call. The lady answered on the other end and I told her what I wanted. She said   Oh  great you called. We have four or five apartments available right now.  She said   Do you want  a one bedroom or two bedroom   Then she said   Let's not talk about that. Just come on down   select the apartment that you want. We'll sign the contract and you'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away.  So I was excited. I jumped in my car. I went downtown and knocked on the door. When I knocked on the door   the woman came to the door  and she looked at me  and she said   Can I help you   I said   Yes  I'm the person  who called about the apartments. I was just coming down  to make my selection.  She said   You know what   I'm really sorry  but my husband rented those apartments and didn't tell me about them.  I said   You mean he rented  all five of them in one hour   She didn't give me a response  and what she said was this  She said   Why don't you leave your number  and if we have some openings   I'll give you a call   Needless to say  I did not get a call from her. Nor did I get any responses  from the other people that they gave me on the list where I could get apartments. So as a result of that  and feeling rejected  I went back to the base  and I talked to the squadron commander. His name was McDow  Major McDow. I said   Major McDow  I need your help.  I told him what happened   and here's what he said to me  He said   James  I would love to help you. But you know the problem  We can't make people rent to folks  that they don't want to rent to. And besides  we have a great relationship with people in the community and we really don't want to damage that.  He said   So maybe this is  what you should do. Why don't you let your family stay home  because you do know  that you get a    day leave. So once a year  you can go home to your family  spend    days and then come on back.  Needless to say  that didn't resonate for me. So after leaving him   I went back to personnel  and talking to the clerk  he said   Jim  I think I have a  solution for you. There's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer. If you noticed  in Mountain Home  there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place. You can buy his trailer  and you'd probably get a really good deal because he wants to get out of town as soon as possible. And that would take care of your problem  and that would provide  the solution for you.  So I immediately jumped in my car  went downtown  saw the trailer    it was a small trailer  but under the circumstances  I figured that was the  best thing that I could do. So I bought the trailer. And then I asked him    Can I just leave the trailer here  and that would take care  of all my problems  I wouldn't have to find another trailer park   He said   Before I say yes to that   I need to check with management.  So I get back to the base  he called me back and management said   No  you can't leave the trailer here because we had promised that slot to some other people.  And that was strange to me because there were several  other slots that were open  but it just so happened that he  had promised that slot to someone else. So  what I did    and he said   You shouldn't worry  Jim  because there are a lot of trailer parks.  So I put out another exhaustive list of going to trailer parks. I went to one after another   after another. And I got the same kind of rejection there that I received when I was looking  for the apartment. And as a result  the kind of comments that they made to me  in addition to saying that they didn't have any slots open  one person said   Jim  the reason why we can't rent to you  we already have a Negro family in the trailer park.  He said   And it's not me   because I like you people.  And that's what I did  too. I chuckled  too. He said   But here's the problem  If I let you in  the other tenants  will move out and I can't afford to take that kind of a hit.  He said   I just can't rent to you.  Even though that was discouraging  it didn't stop me. I kept looking  and I looked at the far end  of the town in Mountain Home  and there was a small trailer park. I mean  a really small trailer park. It didn't have any paved roads in it  it didn't have the concrete slabs  it didn't have fencing to portion off your trailer slot  from other trailer slots. It didn't have a laundry facility. But the conclusion I reached  at that moment was that I didn't have  a lot of other options. So I called my wife  and I said   We're going to make this one work.  And we moved into it and we became homeowners in Mountain Home  Idaho. And of course  eventually things settled down. Four years after that  I received papers to move from Mountain Home  Idaho to a place called Goose Bay  Labrador. We won't even talk about that. It was another great location.  Laughter  So my challenge then was to get my family  from Mountain Home  Idaho to Sharon  Pennsylvania. That wasn't a problem because we had just purchased a brand new automobile. My mother called  and said she'll fly out. She'll be with us as we drive  she'll help us manage the children. So she came out  her and Alice  put a lot of food together for the trip. That morning  we left at about   a.m. Great trip  having a great time   good conversation. Somewhere around         o'clock  we got a little bit tired  and we said   Why don't we get a motel so that we can rest and then have an early start in the morning   So we were looking at a number  of the motels as we drove down the road  and we saw one  it was a great big  bright flashing light that said   Vacancies  Vacancies  Vacanies.  So we stopped in. They were in the parking lot   I went inside. When I walked inside  the lady was just finishing up  one contract with some folks  some other people  were coming in behind me. And so I walked to the counter  and she said   How can I help you   I said   I would like to get a motel  for the evening for my family.  She said   You know  I'm really sorry  I just rented the last one. We will not have any more  until the morning.  She said   But if you go down the road about an hour     minutes  there's another trailer park down there.  I said   Yeah  but you still have the  'Vacancies' light on  and it's flashing.  She said   Oh  I forgot.  And she reached over  and turned the light off. She looked at me and I looked at her. There were other people in the room. She kind of looked at them. No one said anything. So I just got the hint and I left  and went outside to the parking lot. And I told my mother and I told my wife and also Melanie  and I said   It looks like we're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road to be able to sleep tonight.  And we did drive down the road  but just before we took off  and pulled out of the parking lot  guess what happened  The light came back on. And it said   Vacancies   Vacancies  Vacancies.  We were able to find a nice place. It wasn't our preference  but it was secure and it was clean. And so we had a great sleep that night. The piece that's important about that is that we had similar kinds of experiences from Idaho all the way through  to Pennsylvania  where we were rejected from hotels   motels and restaurants. But we made it to Pennsylvania. We got the family settled. Everyone was glad to see the kids. I jumped on a plane and shot off to Goose Bay  Labrador  which is another story  right  Here it is     years later  I now have nine grandchildren   two great grandchildren. Five of the grandchildren are boys. I have master's  Ph.D.  undergrad  one in medical school. I have a couple that are trending. They're almost there but not quite.  Laughter  I have one who has been  in college now for eight years. He doesn't have a degree yet   but he wants to be a comedian. So we're just trying to get him to stay in school. Because you never know  just because you're funny at home  does not make you a comedian  right  But the thing about it   they're all good kids    no drugs  no babies  in high school  no crime. So with that being the backdrop  I was sitting in my TV room watching TV  and they were talking about Ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on. And all of a sudden  one of the news  commentators got on the air and she said   In the last three months  eight unarmed African American males have been killed by police  white homeowners  or white citizens.  For some reason  at that moment it just all hit me. I said   What is it  It is so insane. What is the hatred that's causing people  to do these kinds of things   Just then  one of my grandsons called. He said   Granddad  did you hear what they said on TV   I said   Yes  I did.  He said   I'm just so confused. We do everything we do  but it seems that driving while black  walking while black  talking while black  it's just dangerous. What can we do  We do everything that you told us to do. When stopped by the police  we place both hands on the steering wheel at the    o'clock position. If asked to get identification  we tell them  'I am slowly reaching over  into the glove compartment to get my I.D.' When pulled out of the car to be searched  when laid on the ground to be searched  when our trunks are opened to be searched  we don't push back  we don't challenge because we know  you've told us  'Don't you challenge the police. After it's over  call us and we'll be the ones to challenge.  He said   And this is the piece  that really bugs me  Our white friends  our buddies  we kind of hang together. When they hear about these kinds of things happening to us  they say  'Why do you take it  You need to push back. You need to challenge. You need to ask them  for their identification.'  And here's what the boys have been taught to tell them   We know that you can do that  but please do not do that while we're in the car because the consequences for you are significantly different than the consequences for us.  And so as a grandparent   what do I tell my grandsons  How do I keep them safe  How do I keep them alive  As a result of this  people have come to me and said   Jim  are you angry   And my response to that is this   I don't have the luxury of being angry  and I also know the consequences  of being enraged.  So therefore  the only thing that I can do is take my collective intellect and my energy and my ideas and my experiences and dedicate myself to challenge   at any point in time  anything that looks  like it might be racist. So the first thing I have  to do is to educate  the second thing I have to do  is to unveil racism  and the last thing I need to do is do everything within my power to eradicate racism in my lifetime by any means necessary. The second thing I do is this  I want to appeal to Americans. I want to appeal to their humanity  to their dignity  to their civic pride and ownership to be able to not react to these  heinous crimes in an adverse manner. But instead  to elevate your level of societal knowledge  your level of societal awareness and societal consciousness to then collectively come together  all of us come together  to make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity  any kind of insanity that makes it  okay to kill unarmed people  regardless of their ethnicity  regardless of their race  regardless of their diversity makeup. We have to challenge that. It doesn't make any sense. The only way I think we can do that is through a collective. We need to have black and white  and Asian and Hispanic just to step forward and say   We are not going to accept  that kind of behavior anymore. \n",
      "On September     the morning of my seventh birthday  I came downstairs to the kitchen  where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something  and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway  and they said   Hey  happy birthday   And I said   I'm seven.  And my father smiled and said   Well  you know what that means  don't you   And I said   Yeah  that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents   And my dad said   Well  yes. But more importantly  being seven means that you've reached the age of reason  and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.  Now  I had heard this phrase   age of reason   before. Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second grade class at school. But when she said it  the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession  and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil. And anyway  I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase   age of reason.  So  I said   Yeah  yeah  age of reason. What does that mean again   And my dad said   Well  we believe  in the Catholic Church  that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong  but when you're seven  you're old enough to know better. So  you've grown up and reached the age of reason  and now God will start keeping notes on you  and begin your permanent record.  And I said   Oh ... Wait a minute. You mean all that time  up till today  all that time I was so good  God didn't notice it   And my mom said   Well  I noticed it.  And I thought   How could I not have known this before  How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me  All that being good and no real credit for it. And worst of all  how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me   So I said   Well  Mom and Dad  what about Santa Claus  I mean  Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice  right   And my dad said   Yeah  but  honey  I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  And my mother said   Oh  Bob  stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean  she's seven. Julie  there is no Santa Claus.  Now  this was actually not that upsetting to me. My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus  how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve  like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning  our family would give Santa more time. Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning  but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss. Which made me very suspicious. It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents. I mean  my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style  and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's. Plus  why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's  There was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence  our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit  and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment  this humiliation of rejection by Santa  who was jolly    but let's face it  he was also very judgmental. So to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief. I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa  but rather  I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing. It was too late for me  but maybe I could help someone else  someone who could use the information. They had to fit two criteria  they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason  and not yet seven. The answer was clear  my brother Bill. He was six. Well  I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday  and he was all by himself  just kicking a ball against the side of a wall. I ran up to him and said   Bill  I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven  and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.  And Bill said   So   And I said   So  you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it.  And he said   So   And I said   So  So everything   And I turned to run. I was so angry with him. But when I got to the top of the steps  I turned around dramatically and said   Oh  by the way  Bill    there is no Santa Claus.  Now  I didn't know it at the time  but I really wasn't turning seven on September   th. For my   th birthday  I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends  but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said   I need to speak to you privately. September   th is not your birthday. It's October   th.  And I said   What   And she said ...  Listen. The cut off date to start kindergarten was September   th.   So I told them that your birthday was September   th  and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place  so I started to tell you your birthday was September   th. But  Julie  you were so ready to start school  honey. You were so ready.  I thought about it  and when I was four  I was already the oldest of four children  and my mother even had another child to come  so what I think she    understandably    really meant was that she was so ready  she was so ready. Then she said   Don't worry  Julie. Every year on October   th  when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it  I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day.  Which was comforting  but troubling. My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me  without me. What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I had to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends. What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo. I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom. And I read my horoscope every single day  and it was so totally me. And this meant that I was a Libra  So  I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster. The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair  sort of lounging by some water  but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. This was around the time that I started filling out physically  and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls  and frankly  the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing. But I got the new Libra poster  and I started to read my new Libra horoscope  and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me. It wasn't until years later  looking back on this whole age of reason  change of birthday thing  that it dawned on me  I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me. Oh  life can be so cruel. One day  two Mormon missionaries came to my door. Now  I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles  and my block is    well  it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door. Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven. And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people  if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them. So normally  I just ignore the doorbell  but on this day  I answered. And there stood two boys  each about     in white  starched short sleeved shirts  and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  and they said they had a message for me  from God. I said   A message for me  From God   And they said   Yes.  Now  I was raised in the Pacific Northwest  around a lot of Church of Latter day Saints people and  you know  I've worked with them and even dated them  but I never really knew the doctrine  or what they said to people when they were out on a mission  and I guess I was sort of curious  so I said   Well  please  come in.  And they looked really happy  because I don't think this happens to them all that often. And I sat them down  and I got them glasses of water    Ok  I got it  I got it. I got them glasses of water. Don't touch my hair  that's the thing. You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair. Ok. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water  and after niceties  they said   Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart   And I thought   Well  of course I believe in God  but you know  I don't like that word 'heart ' because it anthropomorphizes God  and I don't like the word  'his ' either  because that sexualizes God.  But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys  so after a very long  uncomfortable pause  I said   Yes  yes  I do. I feel very loved.  And they looked at each other and smiled  like that was the right answer. And then they said   Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet   And I said   Yes  I do.  And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly. And they said   Well  then we have a story to tell you.  And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi  who lived in Jerusalem in     BC. Now  apparently in Jerusalem in     BC  everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them  man  woman  child  infant  fetus. And God came to Lehi and said to him   Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here.  And God did lead them. He led them to America. I said   America  From Jerusalem to America by boat in     BC   And they said   Yes.  Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced  and over the course of     years  there were two great races of them  the Nephites and the Lamanites  and the Nephites were totally good    each and every one of them    and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil    every single one of them just bad to the bone. Then  after Jesus died on the cross for our sins  on his way up to heaven  he stopped by America and visited the Nephites. And he told them that if they all remained totally  totally good    each and every one of them    they would win the war against the evil Lamanites. But apparently somebody blew it  because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites. All but one guy  this guy named Mormon  who managed to survive by hiding in the woods. And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates  which he then buried near Palmyra  New York. Well  I was just on the edge of my seat. I said   What happened to the Lamanites   And they said   Well  they became our Native Americans  here in the U.S.  And I said   So  you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil   And they said   Yes.  Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard  and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into  and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English. Well  at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch. I wanted to say     Ok  don't start with this story.  I mean  even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start    telling people all about Xenu  the evil intergalactic overlord. Then  they said   Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets   And I said   No  I don't   because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story  but the truth was  I hadn't really thought this through  so I backpedaled a little and I said   Well  what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'  And what do you mean by prophets  Like  could the prophets be women   And they said   No.  And I said   Why   And they said   Well  it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular  it is so wonderful  that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy.  What is this wonderful gift God gave women  I wondered  Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt  Women's longer lifespan  The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men  But no    it wasn't any of these gifts. They said   Well  it's her ability to bear children.  I said   Oh  come on. I mean  even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were    to the time they were     assuming they didn't die from exhaustion  it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God.  And they said   No.  Well  then they didn't look so fresh faced and cute to me any more  but they had more to say. They said   Well  we also believe that if you're a Mormon  and if you're in good standing with the church  when you die  you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity.  And I said   Oh  dear. That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me.  And they said   Oh. Hey  Well  we also believe that when you go to heaven  you get your body restored to you in its best original state. Like  if you'd lost a leg  well  you get it back. Or  if you'd gone blind  you could see.  I said   Oh. Now  I don't have a uterus  because I had cancer a few years ago. So does this mean that if I went to heaven  I would get my old uterus back   And they said   Sure.  And I said   I don't want it back. I'm happy without it.  Gosh. What if you had a nose job and you liked it  Would God force you to get your old nose back  Then they gave me this Book of Mormon  told me to read this chapter and that chapter  and said they'd come back and check in on me  and I think I said something like   Please don't hurry   or maybe just   Please don't   and they were gone. Ok  so I initially felt really superior to these boys  and smug in my more conventional faith. But then the more I thought about it  the more I had to be honest with myself. If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time  and they said   We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse  and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us.   And she had a baby  and that's the son of God   I mean  I would think that's equally ridiculous. I'm just so used to that story. So  I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys. But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head  Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart  Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question. Now  if they had asked me   Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart   Well  that would have been much different  I think I would have instantly answered   Yes  yes  I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused  and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits  and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see.  But since they asked me that question with the word  believe  in it  somehow it was all different  because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.\n",
      "A few years ago  I got one of those spam emails. And it managed to get through my spam filter. I'm not quite sure how  but it turned up in my inbox  and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh. I know. It went like this  it said   Hello James Veitch  I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you  Solomon.  Now  my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button  right  I was looking at my phone. I thought  I could just delete this. Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do. And I said   Solomon  Your email intrigues me.  And the game was afoot. He said   Dear James Veitch  We shall be shipping Gold to you.   You will earn     of any gold you distributes.  So I knew I was dealing with a professional. I said   How much is it worth   He said   We will start with smaller quantity      I was like  aww    and then he said   of    kgs. The worth should be about   .  million.  I said   Solomon  if we're going to do it  let's go big. I can handle it. How much gold do you have   He said   It is not a matter of how much gold I have  what matters is your capability of handling. We can start with    kgs as trial shipment.  I said      kgs  There's no point doing this at all unless you're shipping at least a metric ton.  He said   What do you do for a living   I said   I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager.  This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion  my friend  no no no. Then I started to panic. I was like   Where are you based   I don't know about you  but I think if we're going via the postal service  it ought to be signed for. That's a lot of gold.  He said   It will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment.  I said   Solomon  I'm completely with you on this one. I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting. Hold tight.  This is what I sent Solomon. I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house  but there's definitely something going on. I said   Solomon  attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart. I've had one of my assistants run the numbers. We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible.  There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings  and this was it for Solomon. He said   I will be so much happy if the deal goes well  because I'm going to get a very good commission as well.  And I said   That's amazing  What are you going to spend your cut on   And he said   On RealEstate  what about you   I thought about it for a long time. And I said   One word  Hummus.   It's going places. I was in Sainsbury's the other day and there were like    different varieties. Also you can cut up carrots  and you can dip them. Have you ever done that  Solomon   He said   I have to go bed now.   Till morrow. Have sweet dream.  I didn't know what to say  I said   Bonsoir my golden nugget  bonsoir.  Guys  you have to understand  this had been going for  like  weeks  albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life  but I had to knock it on the head. It was getting a bit out of hand. Friends were saying   James  do you want to come for a drink   I was like   I can't  I'm expecting an email about some gold.  So I figured I had to knock it on the head. I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion. So I concocted a plan. I said   Solomon  I'm concerned about security. When we email each other  we need to use a code.  And he agreed. I said   Solomon  I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence  Lawyer  Gummy Bear. Bank  Cream Egg. Legal  Fizzy Cola Bottle. Claim  Peanut M Ms. Documents  Jelly Beans. Western Union  A Giant Gummy Lizard.  I knew these were all words they use  right  I said   Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence.  I didn't hear back. I thought  I've gone too far. I've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little. I said   Solomon  Is the deal still on  KitKat.  Because you have to be consistent. Then I did get an email back from him. He said   The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ...  I said   Dude  you have to use the code   What followed is the greatest email I've ever received. I'm not joking  this is what turned up in my inbox. This was a good day.  The business is on. I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear    so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg  for the Peanut M Ms process to start. Send       pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard.  And that was so much fun  right  that it got me thinking  like  what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could  And that's what I've been doing for three years on your behalf. Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails. It's really difficult  and I highly recommend we do it. I don't think what I'm doing is mean. There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers. All I'm doing is wasting their time. And I think any time they're spending with me is time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings  right  And if you're going to do this    and I highly recommend you do    get yourself a pseudonymous email address. Don't use your own email address. That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare. I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements  only one of which was a legitimate response    to a medical question I had. But I'll tell you what  though  guys  I'll tell you what  any day is a good day  any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this   I AM WINNIE MANDELA  THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT.  I was like  oh     that Winnie Mandela. I know so many.  I NEED TO TRANSFER    MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION.  Let that sink in. She sent me this  which is hysterical. And this. And this looks fairly legitimate  this is a letter of authorization. But to be honest  if there's nothing written on it  it's just a shape  I said   Winnie  I'm really sorry to hear of this. Given that Nelson died three months ago  I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious.  That's the worst health condition you can have  not being alive. She said   KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS. ONE LOVE.  I said   Of course. NO WOMAN  NO CRY.  She said   MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF      DOLLARS. ONE LOVE.  I said   no problemo. I SHOT THE SHERIFF.     BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY    Thank you.\n",
      "I think it was in my second grade that I was caught drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo. I was sent straight away to my school principal  and my school principal  a sweet nun  looked at my book with disgust  flipped through the pages  saw all the nudes    you know  I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her    and the nun slapped me on my face and said   Sweet Jesus  this kid has already begun.  I had no clue what she was talking about  but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again until the ninth grade. Thanks to a really boring lecture  I started caricaturing my teachers in school. And  you know  I got a lot of popularity. I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports. I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home. I'm not on top of the class. So for me  cartooning gave me a sense of identity. I got popular  but I was scared I'd get caught again. So what I did was I quickly put together a collage of all the teachers I had drawn  glorified my school principal  put him right on top  and gifted it to him. He had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board. This is a part of that. And I became a school hero. All my seniors knew me. I felt really special. I have to tell you a little bit about my family. That's my mother. I love her to bits. She's the one who taught me how to draw and  more importantly  how to love. She's a bit of a hippie. She said   Don't say that   but I'm saying it anyway. The rest of my family are boring academics  busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car. My father's a little different. My father believed in a holistic approach to living  and  you know  every time he taught us  he'd say   I hate these books  because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution.  While he still held that worldview  I was     I got the best lawyer in town  my older brother Karthik  and I sat him down  and I said   Pa  from today onwards I've decided I'm going to be disciplined  I'm going to be curious  I'm going to learn something new every day  I'm going to be very hard working  and I'm not going to depend on you emotionally or financially.  And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me. And I said   Hold that thought.  I said   Can I quit school then   But  to cut a long story short  I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist. I must have done about        caricatures. I would do birthday parties  weddings  divorces  anything for anyone who wanted to use my services. But  most importantly  while I was traveling  I taught children cartooning  and in exchange  I learned how to be spontaneous. And mad and crazy and fun. When I started teaching them  I said let me start doing this professionally. When I was    I started my own school. However  an    year old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter. So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India when I saw that the Prime Minister of India was visiting my home town  Bangalore. And  you know  just like how every cartoonist knows Bush here  and if you had to meet Bush  it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist's delight. I had to meet my Prime Minister. I went to the place where his helicopter was about to land. I saw layers of security. I caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards  but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third. And what happened was  to my luck  I saw a nuclear scientist at whose party I had done cartoons. I ran up to him  and said   Hello  sir. How do you do   He said   What are you doing here  Raghava   I said   I'm here to meet the Prime Minister.  He said   Oh  so am I.  I hopped into his car  and off we went through the remaining layers of security. Thank you. I sat him down  I caricatured him  and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities. This is one I remember fondly. Salman Rushdie was pissed off I think because I altered the map of New York  if you notice. Anyway  the next slide I'm about to show you    Should I just turn that off  The next slide I'm about to show you  is a little more serious. I was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after     . What was  for me  a very naive observation  turned out to be a disaster. That evening  I came home to hundreds of hate mails  hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this. I was also asked to leave the organization  a cartoonists' organization in America  that for me was my lifeline. That's when I realized  you know  cartoons are really powerful  art comes with responsibility. Anyway  what I did was I decided that I need to take a break. I quit my job at the papers  I closed my school  and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks  and I decided to go traveling. When I went traveling  I remember  I met this fabulous old man  who I met when I was caricaturing  who turned out to be an artist  in Italy. He invited me to his studio. He said   Come and visit.  When I went  I saw the ghastliest thing ever. I saw this dead  naked effigy of himself hanging from the ceiling. I said   Oh  my God. What is that   And I asked him  and he said   Oh  that thing  In the night  I die. In the morning  I am born again.  I thought he was koo koo  but something about that really stuck. I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that. So I said   I am dead  so I need to be born again.  So  I wanted to be a painter like him  except  I don't know how to paint. So  I tried going to the art store. You know  there are a hundred types of brushes. Forget it  they will confuse you even if you know how to draw. So I decided  I'm going to learn to paint by myself. I'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how I painted and a little bit about my city  Bangalore. They had to be larger than life. Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger. And even bigger. And for me it was  I had to dance while I painted. It was so exciting. Except  I even started painting dancers. Here for example is a Flamenco dancer  except there was one problem. I didn't know the dance form  so I started following them  and I made some money  sold my paintings and would rush off to France or Spain and work with them. That's Pepe Linares  the renowned Flamenco singer. But I had one problem  my paintings never danced. As much energy as I put into them while making them  they never danced. So I decided    I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning. I called my friends  painted on their bodies  and had them dance in front of a painting. And  all of a sudden  my paintings came alive. And then I was fortunate enough to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus. And I sat like you guys there in the audience. And I saw my work come alive. You know  normally you work in isolation  and you show at a gallery  but here  the work was coming alive  and it had some other artists working with me. The collaborative effort was fabulous. I said  I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet. I started doing fashion. This is a fashion show we held in London. The best collaboration  of course  is with children. They are ruthless  they are honest  but they're full of energy and fun. This is a work  a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation. And I must say  I spent time in the Bronx working with these kids. And  in exchange for me working with them  they taught me how to be cool. I don't think I've succeeded  but they've taught me. They said   Stop saying sorry. Say  my bad.  Then I said  all this is good  but I want to paint like a real painter. American education is so expensive. I was in India  and I was walking down the streets  and I saw a billboard painter. And these guys paint humongous paintings  and they look really good. And I wondered how they did it from so close. So  one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys  and I said   How do you paint like that  Who taught you   And he said   Oh  it's very easy. I can teach you  but we're leaving the city  because billboard painters are a dying  extinct bunch of artists  because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them.  I said  in exchange for education in how to paint  I will support them  and I started a company. And since then  I've been painting all over the place. This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment. This is another painting. And  in fact  I started painting on anything  and started sending them around town. Since I mentioned my wife  the most important collaboration has been with her  Netra. Netra and I met when she was   . I must have been    and a half then  and it was love at first sight. I lived in India. She lived in America. She'd come every two months to visit me  and then I said I'm the man  I'm the man  and I have to reciprocate. I have to travel seven oceans  and I have to come and see you. I did that twice  and I went broke. So then I said   Nets  what do I do   She said   Why don't you send me your paintings  My dad knows a bunch of rich guys. We'll try and con them into buying it  and then...  But it turned out  after I sent the works to her  that her dad's friends  like most of you  are geeks. I'm joking. No  they were really big geeks  and they didn't know much about art. So Netra was stuck with    paintings of mine. So what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it. She contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work. She made enough money  she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers  a company  everything  and she became my manager. That's us in New York. Notice one thing  we're equal here. Something happened along the line. But this brought me    with Netra managing my career    it brought me a lot of success. I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar. I loved the attention. This is all the press we got  and we said  it's time to celebrate. And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra. I said   Let's get married.  And I said   Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us  all the people who bought our work.  And you won't believe it  we put together a list of       people  who had made a difference    a ridiculous list  but I was determined to bring them to India  so    a lot of them were in India.     artists volunteered to help me with my wedding. We had fashion designers  installation artists  models  we had makeup artists  jewelry designers  all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation. And I had a special installation in tribute to my in laws. I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me. But all this excitement led to the press writing about us. We were in the papers  we're still in the news three years later  but  unfortunately  something tragic happened right after. My mother fell very ill. I love my mother and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die. And they said you have to say bye to her  you have to do what you have to do. And I was devastated. I had shows booked up for another year. I was on a high. And I couldn't. I could not. My life was not exuberant. I could not live this larger than life person. I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind. Of course  my work turned ugly  but another thing happened. I lost all my audiences. The Bollywood stars who I would party with and buy my work disappeared. The collectors  the friends  the press  everyone said   Nice  but thank you.   No thank you   was more like it. But I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut  because I was painting it from my gut. If they wanted beauty  I said  this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized. Of course  none of them liked it. My works also turned autobiographical. At this point  something else happened. A very  very dear friend of mine came out of the closet  and in India at that time  it was illegal to be gay  and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person. I was very upset. I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl    that's me there    because she wanted a girl  and she has only boys. Anyway  I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk. It's a secret. So  after this  my works turned a little violent. I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform. And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality. This time  not only did my collectors disappear  the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing. It turned nasty  and I'm a bit of a chicken. I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat. So  I decided it was time to end and go back home. This time I said let's try something different. I need to be reborn again. And I thought the best way  as most of you know who have children  the best way to have a new lease on life  is to have a child. I decided to have a child  and before I did that  I quickly studied what can go wrong. How can a family get dysfunctional  And Rudra was born. That's my little son. And two magical things happened after he was born. My mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation  and this man was elected president of this country. You know I sat at home and I watched. I teared up and I said that's where I want to be. So Netra and I wound up our life  closed up everything we had  and we decided to move to New York. And this was just eight months ago. I moved back to New York  my work has changed. Everything about my work has become more whimsical. This one is called  What the Fuck Was I Thinking   It talks about mental incest. You know  I may appear to be a very nice  clean  sweet boy. But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything. But I'm very civil in my action  I assure you. These are just different cartoons. And  before I go  I want to tell you a little story. I was talking to mother and father this morning  and my dad said   I know you have so much you want to say  but you have to talk about your work with children.  So I said  okay. I work with children all over the world  and that's an entirely different talk  but I want to leave you with one story that really  really inspired me. I met Belinda when she was   . I was   . I was in Australia  and Belinda had cancer  and I was told she's not going to live very long. They  in fact  told me three weeks. I walk into her room  and there was a shy girl  and she was bald  and she was trying to hide her baldness. I whipped out my pen  and I started drawing on her head and I drew a crown for her. And then  we started talking  and we spent a lovely time    I told her how I ended up in Australia  how I backpacked and who I conned  and how I got a ticket  and all the stories. And I drew it out for her. And then I left. Belinda died and within a few days of her death  they published a book for her  and she used my cartoon on the cover. And she wrote a little note  she said   Hey Rags  thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world.  For me  my art is my magic carpet ride. I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride  and touch children and be honest. Thank you so much.\n",

      "As an Indian  and now as a politician and a government minister  I've become rather concerned about the hype we're hearing about our own country  all this talk about India becoming a world leader  even the next superpower. In fact  the American publishers of my book   The Elephant  The Tiger and the Cell Phone   added a gratuitous subtitle saying   India  The next   st century power.  And I just don't think that's what India's all about  or should be all about. Indeed  what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic. It's redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads. After all  what constitutes a world leader  If it's population  we're on course to top the charts. We will overtake China by     . Is it military strength  Well  we have the world's fourth largest army. Is it nuclear capacity  We know we have that. The Americans have even recognized it  in an agreement. Is it the economy  Well  we have now the fifth largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms. And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year  we grew at  .  percent. But  somehow  none of that adds up to me  to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world  in this part of the   st century. And so I wondered  could what the future beckons for India to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else  the power of example  the attraction of India's culture  what  in other words  people like to call  soft power.  Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic  Joseph Nye  a friend of mine. And  very simply  and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here  it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture  its political values  its foreign policies. And  you know  lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States  but we know the Alliance Francaise is all about French soft power  the British Council. The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power. Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships. But  the fact is  in fact  that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds have done more for American soft power around the world than any specifically government activity. So soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments  but partly despite governments. And in the information era we all live in today  what we might call the TED age  I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news  of televised images  of cellphone videos  of email gossip. In other words  all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries  whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories. Now  in this age  again  countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage. And of course they have more influence  sometimes  about how they're seen. India has more all news TV channels than any country in the world  in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together. But  the fact still is that it's not just that. In order to have soft power  you have to be connected. One might argue that India has become an astonishingly connected country. I think you've already heard the figures. We've been selling    million cellphones a month. Currently there are     million cellphones in Indian hands  in India. And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market. In fact  those    million cellphones are the most connections that any country  including the U.S. and China  has ever established in the history of telecommunications. But  what perhaps some of you don't realize is how far we've come to get there. You know  when I grew up in India  telephones were a rarity. In fact  they were so rare that elected members of Parliament had the right to allocate    telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy. If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist  or a doctor or something  you might have a telephone. But sometimes it just sat there. I went to high school in Calcutta. And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer. But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces  there would be no dial tone. If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number  the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach. In fact the words  wrong number  were more popular than the word  Hello.  If you then wanted to connect to another city  let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi  you'd have to book something called a trunk call  and then sit by the phone all day  waiting for it to come through. Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call. But  lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days  so  it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through. In fact  so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in      and complained about this. And the Then Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury  not a right  that the government had no obligation to provide better service  and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone  could he please return it  since there was an eight year long waiting list for telephones in India. Now  fast forward to today and this is what you see  the    million cell phones a month. But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones. You know  if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi  on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the   th century  wielding a coal fired steam iron that might have been invented in the   th century. He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a   st century instrument. He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free  and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood  to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed. The other day I was in Kerala  my home state  at the country farm of a friend  about    kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban. And it was a hot day and he said   Hey  would you like some fresh coconut water   And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics  so I said sure. And he whipped out his cellphone  dialed the number  and a voice said   I'm up here.  And right on top of the nearest coconut tree  with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other  was a local toddy tapper  who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink. Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones. When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices. Farmers now  who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open  if the market was on  whether the product they'd harvested could be sold  what price they'd fetch. They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back  then they'd load the cart. Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call. So this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of India being connected. And that transformation is part of where India is heading today. But  of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading. You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump    Mr. Shekhar Kapur  forgive me    and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio. And the first goat  chewing away  says   You know  this film is not bad.  And the second goat says   No  the book was better.  I usually tend to think that the book is usually better  but  having said that  the fact is that Bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of Indian ness and Indian culture around the globe  not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.  but to the screens of Arabs and Africans  of Senegalese and Syrians. I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar  just to watch a Bollywood movie. She can't understand the dialogue. She's illiterate  so she can't read the French subtitles. But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps  and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action. She goes away with stars in her eyes about India  as a result. And this is happening more and more. Afghanistan  we know what a serious security problem Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world. India doesn't have a military mission there. You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years  One simple fact  you couldn't try to call an Afghan at      in the evening. Why  Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera   Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi   dubbed into Dari  was telecast on Tolo T.V. And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history. Every Afghan family wanted to watch it. They had to suspend functions at     . Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V. set  and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom. Crime went up at     . I have read a Reuters dispatch    so this is not Indian propaganda  a British news agency    about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif  stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers  its hubcaps  its sideview mirrors  any moving part they could find  at       because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store. And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine   Tulsi Zindabad    Long live Tulsi.  That's soft power. And that is what India is developing through the  E  part of TED  its own entertainment industry. The same is true  of course    we don't have time for too many more examples    but it's true of our music  of our dance  of our art  yoga  ayurveda  even Indian cuisine. I mean  the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student  in the mid '  s  and what I see today  you can't go to a mid size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one. But  today in Britain  for example  Indian restaurants in Britain employ more people than the coal mining  ship building and iron and steel industries combined. So the empire can strike back. But  with this increasing awareness of India  with you and with I  and so on  with tales like Afghanistan  comes something vital in the information era  the sense that in today's world it's not the side of the bigger army that wins  it's the country that tells a better story that prevails. And India is  and must remain  in my view  the land of the better story. Stereotypes are changing. I mean  again  having gone to the U.S. as a student in the mid '  s  I knew what the image of India was then  if there was an image at all. Today  people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere speak of the IITs  the Indian Institutes of Technology with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT. This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK. I had a friend  a history major like me  who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam  by an anxiously perspiring European saying   You're Indian  you're Indian  Can you help me fix my laptop   We've gone from the image of India as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails  and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick  to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses  computer wizards  software gurus. But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world. But  there is something more substantive to that. The story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism. It's a civilizational story to begin with. Because India has been an open society for millennia. India gave refuge to the Jews  fleeing the destruction of the first temple by the Babylonians  and said thereafter by the Romans. In fact  legend has is that when Doubting Thomas  the Apostle  Saint Thomas  landed on the shores of Kerala  my home state  somewhere around    A.D.  he was welcomed on shore by a flute playing Jewish girl. And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora in the history of the Jewish people  which has never encountered a single incident of anti semitism. That's the Indian story. Islam came peacefully to the south  slightly more differently complicated history in the north. But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India. You know  we just celebrated  this year  our general elections  the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history. And the next one will be even bigger  because our voting population keeps growing by    million a year. But  the fact is that the last elections  five years ago  gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith  Sonia Gandhi  who then made way for a Sikh  Mohan Singh  to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim  President Abdul Kalam  in a country    percent Hindu. This is India  and of course it's all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the U.S.  the oldest democracy in the modern world  more than     years of free and fair elections  which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn't white  male or Christian. So  maybe    oh sorry  he is Christian  I beg your pardon    and he is male  but he isn't white. All the others have been all those three. All his predecessors have been all those three  and that's the point I was trying to make. But  the issue is that when I talked about that example  it's not just about talking about India  it's not propaganda. Because ultimately  that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world. It was essentially India being itself. And ultimately  it seems to me  that always works better than propaganda. Governments aren't very good at telling stories. But people see a society for what it is  and that  it seems to me  is what ultimately will make a difference in today's information era  in today's TED age. So India now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion  because we have every ethnicity known to mankind  practically  we've every religion know to mankind  with the possible exception of Shintoism  though that has some Hindu elements somewhere. We have    official languages that are recognized in our Constitution. And those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note  spelling out the denominations. We've got all of that. We don't even have geography uniting us  because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with Pakistan in     . In fact  you can't even take the name of the country for granted  because the name  India  comes from the river Indus  which flows in Pakistan. But  the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea. It's the idea of an ever ever land  emerging from an ancient civilization  united by a shared history  but sustained  above all  by pluralist democracy. That is a   st century story as well as an ancient one. And it's the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste  creed  color  culture  cuisine  custom and costume  consonant  for that matter  and still rally around a consensus. And the consensus is of a very simple principle  that in a diverse plural democracy like India you don't really have to agree on everything all the time  so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree. The great success story of India  a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate  in the '  s and '  s  is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus. Now  that is the India that is emerging into the   st century. And I do want to make the point that if there is anything worth celebrating about India  it isn't military muscle  economic power. All of that is necessary  but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome. Somebody said we are super poor  and we are also super power. We can't really be both of those. We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the hardware of development  the ports  the roads  the airports  all the infrastructural things we need to do  and the software of development  the human capital  the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day  to be able to send his or her children to a decent school  and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves. But  it's all taking place  this great adventure of conquering those challenges  those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist. But  it's all taking place in an open society  in a rich and diverse and plural civilization  in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people. That's why India belongs at TED  and that's why TED belongs in India. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Over the last two decades  India has become a global hub for software development and offshoring of back office services  as we call it  and what we were interested in finding out was that because of this huge industry that has started over the last two decades in India  offshoring software development and back office services  there's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to India. When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China  it has  you know  led to considerable angst amongst the Western populations. In fact  if you look at polls  they show a declining trend for support for free trade in the West. Now  the Western elites  however  have said this fear is misplaced. For example  if you have read   I suspect many of you have done so   read the book by Thomas Friedman called  The World Is Flat   he said  basically  in his book that  you know  this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes  it's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented. In fact  he says  it's innovation that will keep the West ahead of the developing world  with the more sophisticated  innovative tasks being done in the developed world  and the less sophisticated  shall we say  drudge work being done in the developing world. Now  what we were trying to understand was  is this true  Could India become a source  or a global hub  of innovation  just like it's become a global hub for back office services and software development  And for the last four years  my coauthor Phanish Puranam and I spent investigating this topic. Initially  or  you know  as people would say  you know  in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the Western innovative model  say   Where are the Indian Googles  iPods and Viagras  if the Indians are so bloody smart    Laughter  So initially  when we started our research  we went and met several executives  and we asked them   What do you think  Will India go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a destination for innovation   They laughed. They dismissed us. They said   You know what  Indians don't do innovation.  The more polite ones said   Well  you know  Indians make good software programmers and accountants  but they can't do the creative stuff.  Sometimes  it took a more  took a veneer of sophistication  and people said   You know  it's nothing to do with Indians. It's really the rule based  regimented education system in India that is responsible for killing all creativity.  They said  instead  if you want to see real creativity  go to Silicon Valley  and look at companies like Google  Microsoft  Intel. So we started examining the R amp D and innovation labs of Silicon Valley. Well  interestingly  what you find there is  usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the R amp D center as they may call it  and more often than not  it's an Indian.  Laughter  So I immediately said   Well  but you could not have been educated in India  right  You must have gotten your education here.  It turned out  in every single case  they came out of the Indian educational system. So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question  and the right question is  really  can Indians based out of India do innovative work  So off we went to India. We made  I think  about a dozen trips to Bangalore  Mumbai  Gurgaon  Delhi  Hyderabad  you name it  to examine what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities. And what we found was  as we progressed in our research  was  that we were asking really the wrong question. When you ask   Where are the Indian Googles  iPods and Viagras   you are taking a particular perspective on innovation  which is innovation for end users  visible innovation. Instead  innovation  if you remember  some of you may have read the famous economist Schumpeter  he said   Innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed.  It could be new products and services  but it could also be new ways of producing products. It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries. Once you take this  there's no reason to restrict innovation  the beneficiaries of innovation  just to end users. When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation  what we found was  India is well represented in innovation  but the innovation that is being done in India is of a form we did not anticipate  and what we did was we called it  invisible innovation.  And specifically  there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of India. The first type of invisible innovation out of India is what we call innovation for business customers  which is led by the multinational corporations  which have    in the last two decades  there have been     R amp D centers set up in India by multinational companies employing more than         professionals. Now  when you consider the fact that  historically  the R amp D center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters  or in the country of origin of that multinational company  to have     R amp D centers of multinational corporations in India is truly a remarkable figure. When we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on  they said   We are working on global products.  They were not working on localizing global products for India  which is the usual role of a local R amp D. They were working on truly global products  and companies like Microsoft  Google  AstraZeneca  General Electric  Philips  have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore and Hyderabad R amp D centers they are able to produce products and services for the world. But of course  as an end user  you don't see that  because you only see the name of the company  not where it was developed. The other thing we were told then was   Yes  but  you know  the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R amp D center cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the U.S. R amp D centers.  So my coauthor Phanish Puranam  who happens to be one of the smartest people I know  said he's going to do a study. What he did was he looked at those companies that had an R amp D center in USA and in India  and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same company's subsidiary in India  so he's now comparing the patents of R amp D centers in the U.S. with R amp D centers in India of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the Indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers  Interestingly  what he finds is   and by the way  the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations  How many times does a future patent reference the older patent    he finds something very interesting. What we find is that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of a U.S. R amp D subsidiary is identical to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary of the same company within that company. So within the company  there's no difference in the forward citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries. So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India. The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies  where many companies today are contracting Indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world. For example  in the pharma industry  a lot of the molecules are being developed  but you see a major part of that work is being sent to India. For example  XCL Technologies  they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new Boeing     Dreamliner  one to avoid collisions in the sky  and another to allow landing in zero visibility. But of course  when you climb onto the Boeing      you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of India. The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations  because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms. Process innovation is different from product innovation. It's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product  but not a new product itself  Only in India do millions of young people dream of working in a call center. What happens   You know  it's a dead end job in the West  what high school dropouts do. What happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart  young  ambitious kids on a call center job  Very quickly  they get bored  and they start innovating  and they start telling the boss how to do this job better  and out of this process innovation comes product innovations  which are then marketed around the world. For example       Customer  traditional call center company  used to be a traditional call center company. Today they're developing analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before you pick up the phone  you can guess or predict what this phone call is about. It's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the West. And the last kind of innovation  invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call management innovation. It's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work  and the most significant management innovation to come out of India  invented by the Indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model. What the global delivery model allows is  it allows you to take previously geographically core located tasks  break them up into parts  send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists  and then specify the means for reintegrating them. Without that  you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today. So  what I'm trying to say is  what we are finding in our research is  that if products for end users is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg  India is well represented in the invisible  large  submerged portion of the innovation iceberg. Now  this has  of course  some implications  and so we developed three implications of this research. The first is what we called sinking skill ladder  and now I'm going to go back to where I started my conversation with you  which was about the flight of jobs. Now  of course  when we first  as a multinational company  decide to outsource jobs to India in the R amp D  what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India  the least sophisticated jobs  just like Tom Friedman would predict. Now  what happens is  when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India for innovation and for R amp D work  at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem  which is where does the next step of the ladder people come from within your company  So you have two choices then  Either you bring the people from India into the developed world to take positions in the next step of the ladder   immigration   or you say  there's so many people in the bottom step of the ladder waiting to take the next position in India  why don't we move the next step to India  What we are trying to say is that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder  you    it's a self perpetuating act  because of the sinking skill ladder  and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that you can't be an investment banker without having been an analyst once. You can't be a professor without having been a student. You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate. So  if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs  at some stage  the next step of the ladder has to follow. The second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the TMT  the top management teams. If the R amp D talent is going to be based out of India and China  and the largest growth markets are going to be based out of India and China  you have to confront the problem that your top management of the future is going to have to come out of India and China  because that's where the product leadership is  that's where the important market leadership is. Right  And the last thing we point out in this slide  which is  you know  that to this story  there's one caveat. India has the youngest growing population in the world. This demographic dividend is incredible  but paradoxically  there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools. Indian institutes and educational system  with a few exceptions  are incapable of producing students in the quantity and quality needed to keep this innovation engine going  so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this  but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure. So finally  I want to conclude by showing you the profile of one company  IBM. As many of you know  IBM has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies. In fact  if you look at the number of patents filed over history  I think they are in the top or the top two or three companies in the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company. Here is the profile of employees of IBM over the last decade. In       they had         employees  or         employees  out of which          were in America        were in India. In       they had         employees  by which time the U.S. employees had moved to          whereas the Indian employees had gone to        . Well  in       they decided they're not going to reveal this data anymore  so I had to make some estimates based on various sources. Here are my best guesses. Okay  I'm not saying this is the exact number  it's my best guess. It gives you a sense of the trend. There are         people now at IBM  out of which        are remaining in the U.S.  and         are in India. So you tell me  is IBM an American company  or an Indian company   Laughter  Ladies and gentlemen  thank you very much.  Applause \n",
      "Let me talk about India through the evolution of ideas. Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it because in every society  especially an open democratic society  it's only when ideas take root that things change. Slowly ideas lead to ideology  lead to policies that lead to actions. In      this country went through a Great Depression  which led to all the ideas of the state and social security  and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time. In the     s we had the Reagan revolution  which lead to deregulation. And today  after the global economic crisis  there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene. So ideas change states. And I looked at India and said  really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on India. The first  to my mind  is what I call as  the ideas that have arrived.  These ideas have brought together something which has made India happen the way it is today. The second set of ideas I call  ideas in progress.  Those are ideas which have been accepted but not implemented yet. The third set of ideas are what I call as  ideas that we argue about     those are ideas where we have a fight  an ideological battle about how to do things. And the fourth thing  which I believe is most important  is  the ideas that we need to anticipate.  Because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having  you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently. Now in India's case I believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today. The first is really the notion of people. In the '  s and '  s we thought of people as a burden. We thought of people as a liability. Today we talk of people as an asset. We talk of people as human capital. And I believe this change in the mindset  of looking at people as something of a burden to human capital  has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset. And this change in thinking of human capital is linked to the fact that India is going through a demographic dividend. As healthcare improves  as infant mortality goes down  fertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that. India is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next    years. What is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend. In other words  it will be the only young country in an aging world. And this is very important. At the same time if you peel away the demographic dividend in India  there are actually two demographic curves. One is in the south and in the west of India  which is already going to be fully expensed by       because in that part of the country  the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a West European country. Then there is the whole northern India  which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend. But a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital. Only if the people have education  they have good health  they have infrastructure  they have roads to go to work  they have lights to study at night    only in those cases can you really get the benefit of a demographic dividend. In other words  if you don't really invest in the human capital  the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster. Therefore India is at a critical point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster. The second thing in India has been the change in the role of entrepreneurs. When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen as a bad lot  as people who would exploit. But today  after    years  because of the rise of entrepreneurship  entrepreneurs have become role models  and they are contributing hugely to the society. This change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy. The third big thing I believe that has changed India is our attitude towards the English language. English language was seen as a language of the imperialists. But today  with globalization  with outsourcing  English has become a language of aspiration. This has made it something that everybody wants to learn. And the fact that we have English is now becoming a huge strategic asset. The next thing is technology. Forty years back  computers were seen as something which was forbidding  something which was intimidating  something that reduced jobs. Today we live in a country which sells eight million mobile phones a month  of which    percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people don't have credit history. Forty percent of those prepaid phones are recharged at less than    cents at each recharge. That is the scale at which technology has liberated and made it accessible. And therefore technology has gone from being seen as something forbidding and intimidating to something that is empowering. Twenty years back  when there was a report on bank computerization  they didn't name the report as a report on computers  they call them as  ledger posting machines.  They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers. And when they wanted to have more advanced  more powerful computers they called them  advanced ledger posting machines.  So we have come a long way from those days where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment  and really has changed the way Indians think of technology. And then I think the other point is that Indians today are far more comfortable with globalization. Again  after having lived for more than     years under the East India Company and under imperial rule  Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism. But today  as Indian companies go abroad  as Indians come and work all over the world  Indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in. And the fact that the demographics are in our favor  because we are the only young country in an aging world  makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians. And finally  India has had the deepening of its democracy. When democracy came to India    years back it was an elite concept. It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth. But today democracy has become a bottom up process where everybody has realized the benefits of having a voice  the benefits of being in an open society. And therefore democracy has become embedded. I believe these six factors    the rise of the notion of population as human capital  the rise of Indian entrepreneurs  the rise of English as a language of aspiration  technology as something empowering  globalization as a positive factor  and the deepening of democracy    has contributed to why India is today growing at rates it has never seen before. But having said that  then we come to what I call as ideas in progress. Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society  but you are not able to implement those things. And really there are four things here. One is the question of education. For some reason  whatever reason    lack of money  lack of priorities  because of religion having an older culture    primary education was never given the focus it required. But now I believe it's reached a point where it has become very important. Unfortunately the government schools don't function  so children are going to private schools today. Even in the slums of India more than    percent of urban kids are going into private schools. So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work. But having said that  there is an enormous desire among everybody  including the poor  to educate their children. So I believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented. Similarly  infrastructure    for a long time  infrastructure was not a priority. Those of you who have been to India have seen that. It's certainly not like China. But today I believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement. It is reflected in the political statements.    years back the political slogan was   Roti  kapada  makaan   which meant   Food  clothing and shelter.  And today's political slogan is   Bijli  sadak  pani   which means  Electricity  water and roads.  And that is a change in the mindset where infrastructure is now accepted. So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived  but simply not implemented. The third thing is again cities. It's because Gandhi believed in villages and because the British ruled from the cities  therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un Indian city. For a long time we have neglected our cities. And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see. But today  finally  after economic reforms  and economic growth  I think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth  cities are engines of creativity  cities are engines of innovation  have finally been accepted. And I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities. Again  an idea which is arrived  but not yet implemented. The final thing is the notion of India as a single market    because when you didn't think of India as a market  you didn't really bother about a single market  because it didn't really matter. And therefore you had a situation where every state had its own market for products. Every province had its own market for agriculture. Increasingly now the policies of taxation and infrastructure and all that  are moving towards creating India as a single market. So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening  which is as important as external globalization. These four factors I believe    the ones of primary education  infrastructure  urbanization  and single market    in my view are ideas in India which have been accepted  but not implemented. Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict. The ideas that we argue about. These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock. What are those ideas  One is  I think  are ideological issues. Because of the historical Indian background  in the caste system  and because of the fact that there have been many people who have been left out in the cold  a lot of the politics is about how to make sure that we'll address that. And it leads to reservations and other techniques. It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people  and all the left and right arguments that we have. A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things. This policy is causing gridlock. This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved. The second one is the labor policies that we have  which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies  that    percent of Indian labor is in the unorganized sector. They have no benefits  they don't have social security  they don't have pension  they don't have healthcare  none of those things. This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce  you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised. Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws  which are not as onerous as they are today. At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector  and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for. The third thing is our higher education. Indian higher education is completely regulated. It's very difficult to start a private university. It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India. As a result of that our higher education is simply not keeping pace with India's demands. That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address. But most important I believe are the ideas we need to anticipate. Here India can look at what is happening in the west and elsewhere  and look at what needs to be done. The first thing is  we're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had the development. So we can use technology for governance. We can use technology for direct benefits. We can use technology for transparency  and many other things. The second thing is  the health issue. India has equally horrible health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue  the higher state of diabetes  the higher state of obesity. So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with a set of rich country diseases. Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health. We really need to put in place a strategy so that we don't go to the other extreme of health. Similarly today in the West you're seeing the problem of entitlement    the cost of social security  the cost of Medicare  the cost of Medicaid. Therefore when you are a young country  again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system so that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old. And then again  India does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty  because it has to marry environment and development. Just to give an idea  the world has to stabilize at something like    gigatons per year. On a population of nine billion our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year. India is already at two tons per year. But if India grows at something like eight percent  income per year per person will go to    times by     . So we're saying  income growing at    times and no growth in carbon. Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment  the way we look at energy  the way we create whole new paradigms of development. Now why does this matter to you  Why does what's happening    thousand miles away matter to all of you  Number one  this matters because this represents more than a billion people. A billion people     th of the world population. It matters because this is a democracy. And it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible  that you can have a democracy  that you can have an open society  and you can have growth. It's important because if you solve these problems  you can solve the problems of poverty in the world. It's important because you need it to solve the world's environment problems. If we really want to come to a point  we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission  we want to really lower the use of energy    it has to be solved in countries like India. You know if you look at the development in the West over     years  the average growth may have been about two percent. Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent. And that makes a huge difference. When India was growing at about three   .  percent and the population was growing at two percent  its per capita income was doubling every    years. When the economic growth goes to eight percent and population growth drops to  .  percent  then per capita income is doubling every nine years. In other words  you're certainly fast forwarding this whole process of a billion people going to prosperity. And you must have a clear strategy which is important for India and important for the world. That is why I think all of you should be equally concerned with it as I am. Thank you very much.\n",
      "My topic is economic growth in China and India. And the question I want to explore with you is whether or not democracy has helped or has hindered economic growth. You may say this is not fair  because I'm selecting two countries to make a case against democracy. Actually  exactly the opposite is what I'm going to do. I'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy  rather than against democracy. The first question there is why China has grown so much faster than India. Over the last    years  in terms of the GDP growth rates  China has grown at twice the rate of India. In the last five years  the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth. But over the last    years  China undoubtedly has done much better than India. One simple answer is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai. Look at the skyline of Shanghai. This is the Pudong area. The picture on India is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai in India. The idea there behind these two pictures is that the Chinese government can act above rule of law. It can plan for the long term benefits of the country and in the process  evict millions of people    that's just a small technical issue. Whereas in India  you cannot do that  because you have to listen to the public. You're being constrained by the public's opinion. Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agrees with that view. In an interview printed in the financial press of India  He said that he wants to make Mumbai another Shanghai. This is an Oxford trained economist steeped in humanistic values  and yet he agrees with the high pressure tactics of Shanghai. So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth  that emphasizes the following features for promoting economic development  infrastructures  airports  highways  bridges  things like that. And you need a strong government to do that  because you cannot respect private property rights. You cannot be constrained by the public's opinion. You need also state ownership  especially of land assets  in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly. The implication of that model is that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth  rather than a facilitator of economic growth. Here's the key question. Just how important are infrastructures for economic growth  This is a key issue. If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth  then you would argue a strong government is necessary to promote growth. If you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe  then you will put less emphasis on strong government. So to illustrate that question  let me give you two countries. And for the sake of brevity  I'll call one country Country   and the other country Country  . Country   has a systematic advantage over Country   in infrastructures. Country   has more telephones  and Country   has a longer system of railways. So if I were to ask you   Which is China and which is India  and which country has grown faster   if you believe in the infrastructure view  then you will say   Country   must be China. They must have done better  in terms of economic growth. And Country   is possibly India.  Actually the country with more telephones is the Soviet Union  and the data referred to     . After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones  the country collapsed. That's not too good. The picture there is Khrushchev. I know that in      he no longer ruled the Soviet Union  but that's the best picture that I can find. Telephones  infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth. Country    that has fewer telephones  is China. Since       the country has performed at a double digit rate every year for the last    years. If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union other than the fact about their telephones  you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades. Country    that has a longer system of railways  is actually India. And Country   is China. This is a very little known fact about the two countries. Yes  today China has a huge infrastructure advantage over India. But for many years  until the late     s  China had an infrastructure disadvantage vis a vis India. In developing countries  the most common mode of transportation is the railways  and the British built a lot of railways in India. India is the smaller of the two countries  and yet it had a longer system of railways until the late     s. So clearly  infrastructure doesn't explain why China did better before the late     s  as compared with India. In fact  if you look at the evidence worldwide  the evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth. The economy grows  government accumulates more resources  and the government can invest in infrastructure    rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth. And this is clearly the story of the Chinese economic growth. Let me look at this question more directly. Is democracy bad for economic growth  Now let's turn to two countries  Country A and Country B. Country A  in       had about      per capita GDP as compared with Country B  which had      in per capita GDP. By       Country A has surpassed Country B with      per capita GDP as compared with      per capita GDP. Both countries are in Asia. If I were to ask you   Which are the two Asian countries  And which one is a democracy   you may argue   Well  maybe Country A is China and Country B is India.  In fact  Country A is democratic India  and Country B is Pakistan    the country that has a long period of military rule. And it's very common that we compare India with China. That's because the two countries have about the same population size. But the more natural comparison is actually between India and Pakistan. Those two countries are geographically similar. They have a complicated  but shared common history. By that comparison  democracy looks very  very good in terms of economic growth. So why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments  One reason is the East Asian Model. In East Asia  we have had successful economic growth stories such as Korea  Taiwan  Hong Kong and Singapore. Some of these economies were ruled by authoritarian governments in the   s and   s and     s. The problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries   Have you won the lottery   And they all tell you   Yes  we have won the lottery.  And then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are     percent. The reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also purchased lottery tickets and didn't end up winning the prize. For each of these successful authoritarian governments in East Asia  there's a matched failure. Korea succeeded  North Korea didn't. Taiwan succeeded  China under Mao Zedong didn't. Burma didn't succeed. The Philippines didn't succeed. If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide  there's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth. So the East Asian model has this massive selection bias    it is known as selecting on a dependent variable  something we always tell our students to avoid. So exactly why did China grow so much faster  I will take you to the Cultural Revolution  when China went mad  and compare that country's performance with India under Indira Gandhi. The question there is  Which country did better  China or India  China was during the Cultural Revolution. It turns out even during the Cultural Revolution  China out perfomed India in terms of GDP growth by an average of about  .  percent every year in terms of per capita GDP. So that's when China was mad. The whole country went mad. It must mean that the country had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth to overcome the negative effects of the Cultural Revolution. The advantage the country had was human capital    nothing else but human capital. This is the world development index indicator data in the early     s. And this is the earliest data that I can find. The adult literacy rate in China is    percent as compared with    percent in India. The contrast in literacy rates is especially sharp between Chinese women and Indian women. I haven't told you about the definition of literacy. In China  the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write       Chinese characters. In India  the definition of literacy  operating definition of literacy  is the ability  the grand ability  to write your own name in whatever language you happen to speak. The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated. If you go to other sources of data such as Human Development Index  that data series  go back to the early     s  you see exactly the same contrast. China held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis a vis India. Life expectancies  as early as       China had a huge advantage in life expectancy. On average  as a Chinese in       you lived    years more than an average Indian. So if you have a choice between being a Chinese and being an Indian  you would want to become a Chinese in order to live    years longer. If you made that decision in       the down side of that is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution. So you have to always think carefully about these decisions. If you cannot chose your nationality  then you will want to become an Indian man. Because  as an Indian man  you have about two years of life expectancy advantage vis a vis Indian women. This is an extremely strange fact. It's very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern. It shows the systematic discrimination and biases in the Indian society against women. The good news is  by       India has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life expectancy. Today  Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over Indian men. So India is reverting to the normal. But India still has a lot of work to do in terms of gender equality. These are the two pictures taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province and garment factories in India. In China  it's all women.    to    percent of the workforce in China is women in the coastal part of the country  whereas in India  it's all men. Financial Times printed this picture of an Indian textile factory with the title   India Poised to Overtake China in Textile.  By looking at these two pictures  I say no  it won't overtake China for a while. If you look at other East Asian countries  women there play a hugely important role in terms of economic take off    in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle associated with East Asia. India still has a long way to go to catch up with China. Then the issue is  what about the Chinese political system  You talk about human capital  you talk about education and public health. What about the political system  Isn't it true that the one party political system has facilitated economic growth in China  Actually  the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that. It depends on a distinction that you draw between statics of the political system and the dynamics of the political system. Statically  China is a one party system  authoritarian    there's no question about it. Dynamically  it has changed over time to become less authoritarian and more democratic. When you explain change    for example  economic growth  economic growth is about change    when you explain change  you use other things that have changed to explain change  rather than using the constant to explain change. Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change  but a fixed effect only explains changes in interaction with the things that change. In terms of the political changes  they have introduced village elections. They have increased the security of proprietors. And they have increased the security with long term land leases. There are also financial reforms in rural China. There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China. To me  the pace of political changes is too slow  too gradual. And my own view is the country is going to face some substantial challenges  because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms. But nevertheless  the system has moved in a more liberal direction  moved in a more democratic direction. You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India. In fact  when India was growing at a Hindu rate of growth    about one percent  two percent a year    that was when India was least democratic. Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in     . The Indian government owned and operated all the TV stations. A little known fact about India in the     s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms  the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self rule  privatization of media and introducing freedom of information acts. So the dynamic perspective fits both with China and in India in terms of the direction. Why do many people believe that India is still a growth disaster  One reason is they are always comparing India with China. But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth. If you are a NBA player and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan  you're going to look not so impressive. But that doesn't mean that you're a bad basketball player. Comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark. In fact  if you compare India with the average developing country  even before the more recent period of acceleration of Indian growth    now India is growing between eight and nine percent    even before this period  India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies. This is a very impressive record indeed. Let's think about the future  the dragon vis a vis the elephant. Which country has the growth momentum  China  I believe  still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals    mostly the social capital  the public health  the sense of egalitarianism that you don't find in India. But I believe that India has the momentum. It has the improving fundamentals. The government has invested in basic education  has invested in basic health. I believe the government should do more  but nevertheless  the direction it is moving in is the right direction. India has the right institutional conditions for economic growth  whereas China is still struggling with political reforms. I believe that the political reforms are a must for China to maintain its growth. And it's very important to have political reforms  to have widely shared benefits of economic growth. I don't know whether that's going to happen or not  but I'm an optimist. Hopefully  five years from now  I'm going to report to TEDGlobal that political reforms will happen in China. Thank you very much.\n",
      "So  what I'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India's    maybe the world's    longest running soap opera  which is cricket. And may it run forever  because it gives people like me a living. It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want  It's got love  joy  happiness  sadness  tears  laughter  lots of deceit  intrigue. And like all good soaps  it jumps    years when the audience interest changes. And that's exactly what cricket has done. It's jumped    years into    over game. And that's what I'm going to talk about  how a small change leads to a very big revolution. But it wasn't always like that. Cricket wasn't always this speed driven generations game. There was a time when you played cricket  you played timeless test matches  when you played on till the game got over. And there was this game in March      that started on the third of March and ended on the   th of March. And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town  which is a two hour train journey  to catch the ship that left on the   th  because the next ship wasn't around for a long time. So  the match was ended in between. And one of the English batsmen said   You know what  Another half an hour and we would have won.  Another half an hour after    days. There were two Sundays in between. But of course  Sundays are church days  so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained  so they all sat around making friends with each other. But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket  because we had about the same pace of life. The Mahabharata was like that as well  wasn't it  You fought by day  then it was sunset  so everyone went back home. And then you worked out your strategy  and you came and fought the next day  and you went back home again. The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket  everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day. Princes patronize the game  not because they love the game  but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers. But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket  which was  all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball  and any number of people could play it anywhere. Take a look  You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there  you could play it in a little alley    you couldn't hit square anywhere  because the bat hit the wall  don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires. You could play it on the banks of the Ganges    that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time. Or you could play many games in one small patch of land  even if you didn't know which game you were actually in. As you can see  you can play anywhere. But slowly the game moved on  you know  finally. You don't always have five days. So  we moved on  and we started playing    over cricket. And then an enormous accident took place. In Indian sport we don't make things happen  accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time  sometimes. And we won this World Cup in     . And suddenly we fell in love with the    over game  and we played it virtually every day. There was more    over cricket than anywhere. But there was another big date.      was when we won the World Cup.      '    we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India  rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country. And so we allowed multinationals into India. We cut customs duties  we reduced import duties  and we got all the multinationals coming in  with multinational budgets  who looked at per capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India  and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian. And there are only two vehicles in India    one real  one scripted. The scripted one is what you see in the movies  the real one was cricket. And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me  Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi  decided he's going to take it all over the world. And Pepsi was this big revolution  because they started taking cricket all over. And so cricket started becoming big  cricket started bringing riches in. Television started covering cricket. For a long time television said   We won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it.  Then they said   OK  the next rights are sold for    million dollars. The next rights are sold for     million dollars.  So  it's a bit of a curve  that. And then another big accident happened in our cricket. England invented    overs cricket  and said   The world must play    overs cricket.  Just as England invented cricket  and made the rest of the world play it. Thank God for them. And so  India had to go and play the T   World Cup  you see. India didn't want to play the T   World Cup. But we were forced to play it by an     margin. And then something very dramatic happened. We got to the final  and then this moment  that will remain enshrined forever  for everybody  take a look. The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder. Announcer  And Zishan takes it  India wins  What a match for a Twenty   final. India  the world champions. India  T   champions. But what a game we had  M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air  but Misbah ul Haq  what a player. A massive  massive success  India  the world TT champions. Harsha Bhogle  Suddenly India discovered this power of    overs cricket. The accident  of course  there  was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast. If he had bowled fast  the ball would have gone where it was meant to go  but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game. And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world. It was at a time when investment was coming in  India was feeling a little more confident about itself. And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do. And thankfully for all of us  the English are very good at inventing things  and then the gracious people that they are  they let the world become very good at it. And so England invented T   cricket  and allowed India to hijack it. It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine  we just took it straight away  as is. And so  we launched our own T   league. Six weeks  city versus city. It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country    the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country  representing itself on the field. One was war  the Indian army  which we don't like to happen very often. The other was Indian cricket. Now  suddenly we had to support city leagues. But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West. America is a home of leagues. And they said   Right  we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India.  But was India ready for it  Because cricket  for a long time in India was always organized. It was never promoted  it was never sold    it was organized. And look what they did with our beautiful  nice  simple family game. All of a sudden  you had that happening. An opening ceremony to match every other. This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar. This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand's population twice over. So  it was a different India. But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern  but didn't want to say that to people. And so  they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived. Everyone secretly watched them  but everyone claimed not to. The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes. They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn't actually love it  these were people who ran serious companies. And so they started promoting cricket big time  started promoting clubs big time. And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it. I mean the IPL had  .  billion dollars before a ball was bowled   .  billion dollars for television revenue over    years  and another    million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities  but they had to do it like the West  right  Because we are setting up leagues. But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized. So  just to give you an example of how they did it    not Manchester United style promotion  but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look. Of course  a lot of people said   Maybe they dance better than they play.  But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket. All along  if you wanted a young cricketer  you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality  your own city  and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers. Now  all of the sudden  if you were to bowl a shot    if Mumbai were to bowl a shot  for example  they needn't go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them  they could go to Trinidad. This was the new India  wasn't it  This was the new world  where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price. And all of a sudden  Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world. So  the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago  overnight. And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies  they asked him   When do you have to reach   He said   I have to be there by a certain time  so I have to leave today.  We said   No  no  no. It's not about when you have to leave  it's about when do you have to reach there   And so he said   I've got to reach on date X.  And they said   Fine  you play to date X  minus one.  So  he played in Hyderabad  went  straight after the game  went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport  sat in a private corporate jet    first refueling in Portugal  second refueling in Brazil  he was in West Indies in time. Never would India have thought on this scale before. Never would India have said   I want a player to play one game for me  and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston  Jamaica to play a game.  And I just thought to myself   Wow  we've arrived somewhere in the world  you know  We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big.  But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket  which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment. There is cricket and the movies. And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs. And so  people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta. They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan. And something very interesting happened. We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket. And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more. And of course  if you were on Preity Zinta's team    as you will see on the clip that follows    if you did well  you got a hug from Preity Zinta. So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look    everyone's watching Preity Zinta. And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd. We'd all seen matches in Kolkata  but we'd never seen anything like this  Shah Rukh  with the Bengali song  getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata    not for India  but for Kolkata. But take a look at this. An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they'd won in Kolkata. Can you imagine  And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said   I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team.  But I thought I'd take this opportunity    there's a few people from Pakistan in here. I'm so happy that you're here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends  right  We can play cricket together  we can be friends. So thank you very much for coming  all of you from Pakistan. There was criticism too because they said   Players are being bought and sold  Are they grain  Are they cattle   Because we had this auction  you see. How do you fix a price for a player  And so the auction that followed literally had people saying   Bang  so many million dollars for so and so player.  There it is. Auctioneer  Going at           dollars. Chennai. Shane Warne sold for         dollars. HB  Suddenly  a game which earned its players    rupees a day    so     rupees for a test match  but if you finish in four days you only got    . The best Indian players who played every test match    every one of the internationals  the top of the line players    standard contracts are         dollars in a whole year. Now they were getting         for six days' work. Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England  he got one and a half million dollars  and he went back and said   For four weeks  I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard  and I'm earning more than the footballers  wow.  And where was he earning it from  From a little club in India. Could you have imagined that day would come  One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work. That's not bad  is it  So  at  .  billion dollars before the first ball was bowled. What India was doing  though  was benchmarking itself against the best in the world  and it became a huge brand. Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today. IPL became the biggest brand in India and  because our elections  had to be moved to South Africa  and we had to start the tournament in three weeks. Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks. But we did it. You know why  Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event  and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks. Our population  which for a long time we thought was a problem  suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching    the huge consuming class    everybody came to watch the cricket. We'd also made cricket the only sport in India  which is a pity  but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big  which is a bit of a tragedy of our times. Now  this last minute before I go    there's a couple of side effects of all this. For a long time  India was this country of poverty  dust  beggars  snake charmers  filth  Delhi belly    people heard Delhi belly stories before they came. And  all of a sudden  India was this land of opportunity. Cricketers all over the world said   You know  we love India. We love to play in India.  And that felt good  you know  We said   The dollar's quite powerful actually.  Can you imagine  you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore. There's no filth  there's no beggars  all the snake charmers have vanished  everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules. Right so  finally  an English game that India usurped a little bit  but T   is going to be the next missionary in the world. If you want to take the game around the world  it's got to be the shortest form of the game. You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through    days with no result in the end  or you can't take it all over the world. So that's what T   is doing. Hopefully  it'll make everyone richer  hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n",

      "Strap yourselves in  we're going to Mars. Not just a few astronauts    thousands of people are going to colonize Mars. And I am telling you that they're going to do this soon. Some of you will end up working on projects on Mars  and I guarantee that some of your children will end up living there. That probably sounds preposterous  so I'm going to share with you how and when that will happen. But first I want to discuss the obvious question  Why the heck should we do this     years ago  I gave a TED talk on    ways the world could end suddenly. We are incredibly vulnerable to the whims of our own galaxy. A single  large asteroid could take us out forever. To survive we have to reach beyond the home planet. Think what a tragedy it would be if all that humans have accomplished were suddenly obliterated. And there's another reason we should go  exploration is in our DNA. Two million years ago humans evolved in Africa and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons. This stuff is inside us. And they prospered doing that. Some of the greatest advances in civilization and technology came because we explored. Yes  we could do a lot of good with the money it will take to establish a thriving colony on Mars. And yes we should all be taking far better care of our own home planet. And yes  I worry we could screw up Mars the way we've screwed up Earth. But think for a moment  what we had when John F. Kennedy told us we would put a human on the moon. He excited an entire generation to dream. Think how inspired we will be to see a landing on Mars. Perhaps then we will look back at Earth and see that that is one people instead of many and perhaps then we will look back at Earth  as we struggle to survive on Mars  and realize how precious the home planet is. So let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure we're about to undertake. But first  a few fascinating facts about where we're going. This picture actually represents the true size of Mars compared to Earth. Mars is not our sister planet. It's far less than half the size of the Earth  and yet despite the fact that it's smaller  the surface area of Mars that you can stand on is equivalent to the surface area of the Earth that you can stand on  because the Earth is mostly covered by water. The atmosphere on Mars is really thin        times thinner than on Earth    and it's not breathable  it's    percent carbon dioxide. It's really cold there. The average temperature is minus    degrees  although there is quite a range of temperature. A day on Mars is about as long as a day on Earth  plus about    minutes. Seasons and years on Mars are twice as long as they are on Earth. And for anybody who wants to strap on some wings and go flying one day  Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth  and it's the kind of place where you can jump over your car instead of walk around it. Now  as you can see  Mars isn't exactly Earth like  but it's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system. Here's the problem. Mars is a long way away  a thousand times farther away from us than our own moon. The Moon is         miles away and it took Apollo astronauts three days to get there. Mars is     million miles away and it will take us eight months to get there        days. And that's only if we launch on a very specific day  at a very specific time  once every two years  when Mars and the Earth are aligned just so  so the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest.     days is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues in a tin can. And meanwhile  our track record of getting to Mars is lousy. We and the Russians  the Europeans  the Japanese  the Chinese and the Indians  have actually sent    rockets there  and the vast majority of them have either missed or crashed. Only about a third of the missions to Mars have been successful. And we don't at the moment have a rocket big enough to get there anyway. We once had that rocket  the Saturn V. A couple of Saturn Vs would have gotten us there. It was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans  and it was the rocket that took us to the Moon. But the last Saturn V was used in      to launch the Skylab space station  and we decided to do something called the shuttle instead of continuing on to Mars after we landed on the Moon. The biggest rocket we have now is only half big enough to get us anything to Mars. So getting to Mars is not going to be easy and that brings up a really interesting question ... how soon will the first humans actually land here  Now  some pundits think if we got there by       that'd be a pretty good achievement. These days  NASA seems to be saying that it can get humans to Mars by     . Maybe they can. I believe that they can get human beings into Mars orbit by     . But frankly  I don't think they're going to bother in      to send a rocket to Mars  because we will already be there. We're going to land on Mars in     . And the reason is this man is determined to make that happen. His name is Elon Musk  he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Now  he actually told me that we would land on Mars by       but Elon Musk is more optimistic than I am    and that's going a ways    so I'm giving him a couple of years of slack. Still ... you've got to ask yourself  can this guy really do this by      or       Well  let's put a decade with Elon Musk into a little perspective. Where was this    years ago  That's the Tesla electric automobile. In       a lot of people in the automobile industry were saying  we would not have a decent electric car for    years. And where was that  That is SpaceX's Falcon   rocket  lifting six tons of supplies to the International Space Station.    years ago  SpaceX had not launched anything  or fired a rocket to anywhere. So I think it's a pretty good bet that the person who is revolutionizing the automobile industry in less than    years and the person who created an entire rocket company in less than    years will get us to Mars by     . Now  you need to know this  governments and robots no longer control this game. Private companies are leaping into space and they will be happy to take you to Mars. And that raises a really big question. Can we actually live there  Now  NASA may not be able to get us there until       or we may get there a long time before NASA  but NASA has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can live on Mars. Let's look at the problem this way. Here's what you need to live on Earth  food  water  shelter and clothing. And here's what you need to live on Mars  all of the above  plus oxygen. So let's look at the most important thing on this list first. Water is the basis of all life as we know it  and it's far too heavy for us to carry water from the Earth to Mars to live  so we have to find water if our life is going to succeed on Mars. And if you look at Mars  it looks really dry  it looks like the entire planet is a desert. But it turns out that it's not. The soil alone on Mars contains up to    percent water. And a number of orbiters that we still have flying around Mars have shown us    and by the way  that's a real photograph    that lots of craters on Mars have a sheet of water ice in them. It's not a bad place to start a colony. Now  here's a view of a little dig the Phoenix Lander did in       showing that just below the surface of the soil is ice    that white stuff is ice. In the second picture  which is four days later than the first picture  you can see that some of it is evaporating. Orbiters also tell us that there are huge amounts of underground water on Mars as well as glaciers. In fact  if only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted  most of the planet would be under    feet of water. So there's plenty of water there  but most of it's ice  most of it's underground  it takes a lot of energy to get it and a lot of human labor. This is a device cooked up at the University of Washington back in     . It's basically a low tech dehumidifier. And it turns out the Mars atmosphere is often     percent humid. So this device can extract all the water that humans will need simply from the atmosphere on Mars. Next we have to worry about what we will breathe. Frankly  I was really shocked to find out that NASA has this problem worked out. This is a scientist at MIT named Michael Hecht. And he's developed this machine  Moxie. I love this thing. It's a reverse fuel cell  essentially  that sucks in the Martian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen. And you have to remember that CO     carbon dioxide  which is    percent of Mars' atmosphere    CO  is basically    percent oxygen. Now  the next big rover that NASA sends to Mars in      is going to have one of these devices aboard  and it will be able to produce enough oxygen to keep one person alive indefinitely. But the secret to this    and that's just for testing    the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get go to be scalable by a factor of    . Next  what will we eat  Well  we'll use hydroponics to grow food  but we're not going to be able to grow more than    to    percent of our food there  at least not until water is running on the surface of Mars and we actually have the probability and the capability of planting crops. In the meantime  most of our food will arrive from Earth  and it will be dried. And then we need some shelter. At first we can use inflatable  pressurized buildings as well as the landers themselves. But this really only works during the daytime. There is too much solar radiation and too much radiation from cosmic rays. So we really have to go underground. Now  it turns out that the soil on Mars  by and large  is perfect for making bricks. And NASA has figured this one out  too. They're going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks  shove them in a microwave oven  and then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls. Or we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes  of which there are plenty. And finally there's clothing. On Earth we have miles of atmosphere piled up on us  which creates    pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times  and we're constantly pushing out against that. On Mars there's hardly any atmospheric pressure. So Dava Newman  a scientist at MIT  has created this sleek space suit. It will keep us together  block radiation and keep us warm. So let's think about this for a minute. Food  shelter  clothing  water  oxygen ... we can do this. We really can. But it's still a little complicated and a little difficult. So that leads to the next big    really big step    in living the good life on Mars. And that's terraforming the planet  making it more like Earth  reengineering an entire planet. That sounds like a lot of hubris  but the truth is that the technology to do everything I'm about to tell you already exists. First we've got to warm it up. Mars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere. The answer lies here  at the south pole and at the north pole of Mars  both of which are covered with an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide    dry ice. If we heat it up  it sublimes directly into the atmosphere and thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on Earth. And as we know  CO  is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas. Now  my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very  very large solar sail and focus it    it essentially serves as a mirror    and focus it on the south pole of Mars at first. As the planet spins  it will heat up all that dry ice  sublime it  and it will go into the atmosphere. It actually won't take long for the temperature on Mars to start rising  probably less than    years. Right now  on a perfect day at the equator  in the middle of summer on Mars  temperatures can actually reach    degrees  but then they go down to minus     at night. What we're shooting for is a runaway greenhouse effect  enough temperature rise to see a lot of that ice on Mars    especially the ice in the ground    melt. Then we get some real magic. As the atmosphere gets thicker  everything gets better. We get more protection from radiation  more atmosphere makes us warmer  makes the planet warmer  so we get running water and that makes crops possible. Then more water vapor goes into the air  forming yet another potent greenhouse gas. It will rain and it will snow on Mars. And a thicker atmosphere will create enough pressure so that we can throw away those space suits. We only need about five pounds of pressure to survive. Eventually  Mars will be made to feel a lot like British Columbia. We'll still be left with the complicated problem of making the atmosphere breathable  and frankly that could take       years to accomplish. But humans are amazingly smart and incredibly adaptable. There is no telling what our future technology will be able to accomplish and no telling what we can do with our own bodies. In biology right now  we are on the very verge of being able to control our own genetics  what the genes in our own bodies are doing  and certainly  eventually  our own evolution. We could end up with a species of human being on Earth that is slightly different from the species of human beings on Mars. But what would you do there  How would you live  It's going to be the same as it is on Earth. Somebody's going to start a restaurant  somebody's going to build an iron foundry. Someone will make documentary movies of Mars and sell them on Earth. Some idiot will start a reality TV show. There will be software companies  there will be hotels  there will be bars. This much is certain  it will be the most disruptive event in our lifetimes  and I think it will be the most inspiring. Ask any    year old girl if she wants to go to Mars. Children who are now in elementary school are going to choose to live there. Remember when we landed humans on the Moon  When that happened  people looked at each other and said   If we can do this  we can do anything.  What are they going to think when we actually form a colony on Mars  Most importantly  it will make us a spacefaring species. And that means humans will survive no matter what happens on Earth. We will never be the last of our kind. Thank you.\n",
      "I want to talk about  .  billion years of history in    minutes. That's     million years per minute. Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained of planet Mars. This is fly by  Mariner IV. It was taken in     . When this picture appeared  that well known scientific journal  The New York Times  wrote in its editorial   Mars is uninteresting. It's a dead world. NASA should not spend any time or effort studying Mars anymore.  Fortunately  our leaders in Washington at NASA headquarters knew better and we began a very extensive study of the red planet. One of the key questions in all of science   Is there life outside of Earth   I believe that Mars is the most likely target for life outside the Earth. I'm going to show you in a few minutes some amazing measurements that suggest there may be life on Mars. But let me start with a Viking photograph. This is a composite taken by Viking in     . Viking was developed and managed at the NASA Langley Research Center. We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of     . We had four spacecraft  two around Mars  two on the surface    an amazing accomplishment. This is the first photograph taken from the surface of any planet. This is a Viking Lander photograph of the surface of Mars. And yes  the red planet is red. Mars is half the size of the Earth  but because two thirds of the Earth is covered by water  the land area on Mars is comparable to the land area on Earth. So  Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size. We have obtained topographic measurements of the surface of Mars. We understand the elevation differences. We know a lot about Mars. Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system  Olympus Mons. Mars has the Grand Canyon of the solar system  Valles Marineris. Very  very interesting planet. Mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system  Hellas Basin. This is       miles across. If you happened to be on Mars when this impactor hit  it was a really bad day on Mars. This is Olympus Mons. This is bigger than the state of Arizona. Volcanoes are important  because volcanoes produce atmospheres and they produce oceans. We're looking at Valles Marineris  the largest canyon in the solar system  superimposed on a map of the United States        miles across. One of the most intriguing features about Mars  the National Academy of Science says one of the    major mysteries of the space age  is why certain areas of Mars are so highly magnetized. We call this crustal magnetism. There are regions on Mars  where  for some reason    we don't understand why at this point    the surface is very  very highly magnetized. Is there water on Mars  The answer is no  there is no liquid water on the surface of Mars today. But there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of Mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water. Today Mars is very very dry. We believe there's some water in the polar caps  there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole. Here are some recent images. This is from Spirit and Opportunity. These images that show at one time  there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars. Why is water important  Water is important because if you want life you have to have water. Water is the key ingredient in the evolution  the origin of life on a planet. Here is some picture of Antarctica and a picture of Olympus Mons  very similar features  glaciers. So  this is frozen water. This is ice water on Mars. This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago. It has not been seen publicly. This is European space agency Mars Express  image of a crater on Mars and in the middle of the crater we have liquid water  we have ice. Very intriguing photograph. We now believe that in the early history of Mars  which is  .  billion years ago   .  billion years ago  Mars was very Earth like. Mars had rivers  Mars had lakes  but more important Mars had planetary scale oceans. We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere  and this area in blue  which shows a depression of about four miles  was the ancient ocean area on the surface of Mars. Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go  Well  we have an idea. This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a Mars orbiting satellite called Odyssey. Sub surface water on Mars  frozen in the form of ice. And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color  it means    percent by weight. Sixteen percent  by weight  of the interior contains frozen water  or ice. So  there is a lot of water below the surface. The most intriguing and puzzling measurement  in my opinion  we've obtained of Mars  was released earlier this year in the magazine Science. And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane  CH   in the atmosphere of Mars. And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane. Why is methane important  Because on Earth  almost all      .  percent    of the methane is produced by living systems  not little green men  but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface. We now have evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars  a gas that  on Earth  is biogenic in origin  produced by living systems. These are the three plumes  A  B   B . And this is the terrain it appears over  and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars. In fact  the Earth and Mars are both  .  billion years old. The oldest rock on Earth is only  .  billion. The reason there is a billion year gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics  The crust of the Earth has been recycled. We have no geological record prior for the first billion years. That record exists on Mars. And this terrain that we're looking at dates back to  .  billion years when Earth and Mars were formed. It was a Tuesday. This is a map that shows where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars. Here is Viking I  Viking II. This is Opportunity. This is Spirit. This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix  we just put two years ago. Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers have gone to the northern hemisphere. That's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin. There aren't many craters. And that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites. But look in the southern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters  there are volcanic craters. Here's Hellas Basin  a very very different place  geologically. Look where the methane is  the methane is in a very rough terrain area. What is the best way to unravel the mysteries on Mars that exist  We asked this question    years ago. We invited    of the top Mars scientists to the Langley Research Center for two days. We addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered. And we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question. And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket powered airplane we call ARES. It's an Aerial Regional scale Environmental Surveyor. There's a model of ARES here. This is a    percent scale model. This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center. If any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on Mars  it's the Langley Research Center  for almost     years a leading center of aeronautics in the world. We fly about a mile above the surface. We cover hundreds of miles  and we fly about     miles an hour. We can do things that rovers can't do and landers can't do  We can fly above mountains  volcanoes  impact craters  we fly over valleys  we can fly over surface magnetism  the polar caps  subsurface water  and we can search for life on Mars. But  of equal importance  as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars  we transmit that journey  the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth  we transmit those images back to Earth. And our goal is to inspire the American public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars. But more important we will inspire the next generation of scientists  technologists  engineers and mathematicians. And that's a critical area of national security and economic vitality  to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists  engineers  mathematicians and technologists. This is what ARES looks like as it flies over Mars. We preprogram it. We will fly where the methane is. We will have instruments aboard the plane that will sample  every three minutes  the atmosphere of Mars. We will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems. We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from  because we can measure the gradient where it comes from  and there  we can direct the next mission to land right in that area. How do we transport an airplane to Mars  In two words  very carefully. The problem is we don't fly it to Mars  we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars. The problem is the spacecraft's largest diameter is nine feet  ARES is    foot wingspan     feet long. How do we get it to Mars  We fold it  and we transport it in a spacecraft. And we have it in something called an aeroshell. This is how we do it. And we have a little video that describes the sequence. Video  Seven  six. Green board. Five  four  three  two  one. Main engine start  and liftoff. Joel Levine  This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to Mars. It enters the atmosphere of Mars. A lot of heating  frictional heating. It's going    thousand miles an hour. A parachute opens up to slow it down. The thermal tiles fall off. The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time. It unfolds. The rocket engine begins. We believe that in a one hour flight we can rewrite the textbook on Mars by making high resolution measurements of the atmosphere  looking for gases of biogenic origin  looking for gases of volcanic origin  studying the surface  studying the magnetism on the surface  which we don't understand  as well as about a dozen other areas. Practice makes perfect. How do we know we can do it  Because we have tested ARES model  several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years  under Mars conditions. And  of equal importance is  we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere  at         feet  which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly. Now          feet  if you fly cross country to Los Angeles  you fly        feet. We do our tests at         feet. And I want to show you one of our tests. This is a half scale model. This is a high altitude helium balloon. This is over Tilamook  Oregon. We put the folded airplane on the balloon    it took about three hours to get up there    and then we released it on command at         feet  and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly. And we've done high altitude and low altitude tests  just to perfect this technique. We're ready to go. I have a scale model here. But we have a full scale model in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center. We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters to cover the costs. I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk for this mission. There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing. This is the ARES team  we have about     scientists  engineers  where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory  Goddard Space Flight Center  Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this. It's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center. And let me conclude by saying not too far from here  right down the road in Kittyhawk  North Carolina  a little more than     years ago history was made when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth. We are on the verge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the Earth's atmosphere. We are prepared to fly this on Mars  rewrite the textbook about Mars. If you're interested in more information  we have a website that describes this exciting and intriguing mission  and why we want to do it. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Well  you know  sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages. I am going to try to convince you  in the    minutes I have  that microbes have a lot to say about questions such as   Are we alone   and they can tell us more about not only life in our solar system but also maybe beyond  and this is why I am tracking them down in the most impossible places on Earth  in extreme environments where conditions are really pushing them to the brink of survival. Actually  sometimes me too  when I'm trying to follow them too close. But here's the thing  We are the only advanced civilization in the solar system  but that doesn't mean that there is no microbial life nearby. In fact  the planets and moons you see here could host life    all of them    and we know that  and it's a strong possibility. And if we were going to find life on those moons and planets  then we would answer questions such as  are we alone in the solar system  Where are we coming from  Do we have family in the neighborhood  Is there life beyond our solar system  And we can ask all those questions because there has been a revolution in our understanding of what a habitable planet is  and today  a habitable planet is a planet that has a zone where water can stay stable  but to me this is a horizontal definition of habitability  because it involves a distance to a star  but there is another dimension to habitability  and this is a vertical dimension. Think of it as conditions in the subsurface of a planet where you are very far away from a sun  but you still have water  energy  nutrients  which for some of them means food  and a protection. And when you look at the Earth  very far away from any sunlight  deep in the ocean  you have life thriving and it uses only chemistry for life processes. So when you think of it  at that point  all walls collapse. You have no limitations  basically. And if you have been looking at the headlines lately  then you will see that we have discovered a subsurface ocean on Europa  on Ganymede  on Enceladus  on Titan  and now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on Enceladus  Our solar system is turning into a giant spa. For anybody who has gone to a spa knows how much microbes like that  right  So at that point  think also about Mars. There is no life possible at the surface of Mars today  but it might still be hiding underground. So  we have been making progress in our understanding of habitability  but we also have been making progress in our understanding of what the signatures of life are on Earth. And you can have what we call organic molecules  and these are the bricks of life  and you can have fossils  and you can minerals  biominerals  which is due to the reaction between bacteria and rocks  and of course you can have gases in the atmosphere. And when you look at those tiny green algae on the right of the slide here  they are the direct descendants of those who have been pumping oxygen a billion years ago in the atmosphere of the Earth. When they did that  they poisoned    percent of the life at the surface of the Earth  but they are the reason why you are breathing this air today. But as much as our understanding grows of all of these things  there is one question we still cannot answer  and this is  where are we coming from  And you know  it's getting worse  because we won't be able to find the physical evidence of where we are coming from on this planet  and the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone. All record is gone  erased by plate tectonics and erosion. This is what I call the Earth's biological horizon. Beyond this horizon we don't know where we are coming from. So is everything lost  Well  maybe not. And we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place  and this place in Mars. How is this possible  Well clearly at the beginning of the solar system  Mars and the Earth were bombarded by giant asteroids and comets  and there were ejecta from these impacts all over the place. Earth and Mars kept throwing rocks at each other for a very long time. Pieces of rocks landed on the Earth. Pieces of the Earth landed on Mars. So clearly  those two planets may have been seeded by the same material. So yeah  maybe Granddady is sitting there on the surface and waiting for us. But that also means that we can go to Mars and try to find traces of our own origin. Mars may hold that secret for us. This is why Mars is so special to us. But for that to happen  Mars needed to be habitable at the time when conditions were right. So was Mars habitable  We have a number of missions telling us exactly the same thing today. At the time when life appeared on the Earth  Mars did have an ocean  it had volcanoes  it had lakes  and it had deltas like the beautiful picture you see here. This picture was sent by the Curiosity  rover only a few weeks ago. It shows the remnants of a delta  and this picture tells us something  water was abundant and stayed founting at the surface for a very long time. This is good news for life. Life chemistry takes a long time to actually happen. So this is extremely good news  but does that mean that if we go there  life will be easy to find on Mars  Not necessarily. Here's what happened  At the time when life exploded at the surface of the Earth  then everything went south for Mars  literally. The atmosphere was stripped away by solar winds  Mars lost its magnetosphere  and then cosmic rays and U.V. bombarded the surface and water escaped to space and went underground. So if we want to be able to understand  if we want to be able to find those traces of the signatures of life at the surface of Mars  if they are there  we need to understand what was the impact of each of these events on the preservation of its record. Only then will we be able to know where those signatures are hiding  and only then will we be able to send our rover to the right places where we can sample those rocks that may be telling us something really important about who we are  or  if not  maybe telling us that somewhere  independently  life has appeared on another planet. So to do that  it's easy. You only need to go back  .  billion years ago in the past of a planet. We just need a time machine. Easy  right  Well  actually  it is. Look around you    that's planet Earth. This is our time machine. Geologists are using it to go back in the past of our own planet. I am using it a little bit differently. I use planet Earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of Mars at the time when the climate changed  and there I'm trying  to understand what happened. What are the signatures of life  What is left  How are we going to find it  So for one moment now I'm going to take you with me on a trip into that time machine. And now  what you see here  we are at       meters in the Andes  but in fact we are less than a billion years after the Earth and Mars formed. The Earth and Mars will have looked pretty much exactly like that    volcanoes everywhere  evaporating lakes everywhere  minerals  hot springs  and then you see those mounds on the shore of those lakes  Those are built by the descendants of the first organisms that gave us the first fossil on Earth. But if we want to understand what's  going on  we need to go a little further. And the other thing about those sites is that exactly like on Mars three and a half billion years ago  the climate is changing very fast  and water and ice are disappearing. But we need to go back to that time when everything changed on Mars  and to do that  we need to go higher. Why is that  Because when you go higher  the atmosphere is getting thinner  it's getting more unstable  the temperature is getting cooler  and you have a lot more U.V. radiation. Basically  you are getting to those conditions on Mars when everything changed. So I was not promising anything about a leisurely trip on the time machine. You are not going to be sitting in that time machine. You have to haul       pounds of equipment to the summit of this        foot volcano in the Andes here. That's about       meters. And you also have to sleep on    degree slopes and really hope that there won't be any earthquake that night. But when we get to the summit  we actually find the lake we came for. At this altitude  this lake is experiencing exactly the same conditions as those on Mars three and a half billion years ago. And now we have to change our voyage into an inner voyage inside that lake  and to do that  we have to remove our mountain gear and actually don suits and go for it. But at the time we enter that lake  at the very moment we enter that lake  we are stepping back three and a half billion years in the past of another planet  and then we are going to get the answer came for. Life is everywhere  absolutely everywhere. Everything you see in this picture is a living organism. Maybe not so the diver  but everything else. But this picture is very deceiving. Life is abundant in those lakes  but like in many places on Earth  right now and due to climate change  there is a huge loss in biodiversity. In the samples that we took back home     percent of the bacteria in those lakes were composed of three species  and those three species are the ones that have survived so far. Here's another lake  right next to the first one. The red color you see here is not due to minerals. It's actually due to the presence of a tiny algae. In this region  the U.V. radiation is really nasty. Anywhere on Earth     is considered to be extreme. During U.V. storms there  the U.V. Index reaches   . SPF    is not going to do anything  to you over there  and the water is so transparent in those lakes that the algae has nowhere to hide  really  and so they are developing their own sunscreen  and this is the red color you see. But they can adapt only so far  and then when all the water is gone from the surface  microbes have only one solution left  They go underground. And those microbes  the rocks you see in that slide here  well  they are actually living inside rocks and they are using the protection of the translucence of the rocks to get the good part of the U.V. and discard the part that could actually damage their DNA. And this is why we are taking our rover to train them to search  for life on Mars in these areas  because if there was life on Mars three and a half billion years ago  it had to use the same strategy to actually protect itself. Now  it is pretty obvious that going to extreme environments is helping us very much for the exploration of Mars  and to prepare missions. So far  it has helped us to understand the geology of Mars. It has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution  but also its habitability potential. Our most recent rover on Mars has discovered traces of organics. Yeah  there are organics at the surface of Mars. And it also discovered traces of methane. And we don't know yet if the methane in question is really from geology or biology. Regardless  what we know is that because of the discovery  the hypothesis that there is still life present on Mars today remains a viable one. So by now  I think I have convinced you that Mars is very special to us  but it would be a mistake to think that Mars is the only place in the solar system that is interesting to find potential microbial life. And the reason is because Mars and the Earth could have a common root to their tree of life  but when you go beyond Mars  it's not that easy. Celestial mechanics  is not making it so easy for an exchange of material between planets  and so if we were to discover life on those planets  it would be different from us. It would be a different type of life. But in the end  it might be just us  it might be us and Mars  or it can be many trees of life in the solar system. I don't know the answer yet  but I can tell you something  No matter what the result is  no matter what that magic number is  it is going to give us a standard by which we are going to be able  to measure the life potential  abundance and diversity beyond our own solar system. And this can be achieved by our generation. This can be our legacy  but only if we dare to explore. Now  finally  if somebody tells you that looking  for alien microbes is not cool because you cannot have a philosophical conversation with them  let me show you why and how you can tell them they're wrong. Well  organic material is going to tell you about environment  about complexity and about diversity. DNA  or any information carrier  is going to tell you about adaptation  about evolution  about survival  about planetary changes and about the transfer of information. All together  they are telling us what started as a microbial pathway  and why what started as a microbial pathway sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends up as a dead end. Look at the solar system  and look at the Earth. On Earth  there are many intelligent species  but only one has achieved technology. Right here in the journey of our own solar system  there is a very  very powerful message that says here's how we should look  for alien life  small and big. So yeah  microbes are talking and we are listening  and they are taking us  one planet at a time and one moon at a time  towards their big brothers out there. And they are telling us about diversity  they are telling us about abundance of life  and they are telling us how this life has survived thus far to reach civilization  intelligence  technology and  indeed  philosophy. Thank you.\n",
      "The career that I started early on in my life was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places  and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic  and high deserts and low deserts. Until about a dozen years ago  when I was really captured by caves  and I really re focused most of my research in that direction. So I have a really cool day job   I get to do some really amazing stuff. I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet. Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them  but nevertheless  they're absolutely gripping  and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very  very different from those that we have on the planet. Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo microbiology that we do there  we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets. Particularly Mars  but also Europa  the small  icy moon around Jupiter. And perhaps  someday  far beyond our solar system itself. I'm very passionately interested in the human future  on the Moon and Mars particularly  and elsewhere in the solar system. I think it's time that we transitioned to a solar system going civilization and species. And  as an outgrowth of all of this then  I wonder about whether we can  and whether we even should  think about transporting Earth type life to other planets. Notably Mars  as a first example. Something I never talk about in scientific meetings is how I actually got to this state and why I do the work that I do. Why don't I have a normal job  a sensible job  And then of course  I blame the Soviet Union. Because in the mid     s  when I was a tiny child  they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik  which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin. And a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids. And I'm a product of that generation  like so many other of my peers. It really caught hold of us  and caught fire  and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now. Of course  refusing to grow up       even though I impersonate a grown up in daily life  but I do a fairly good job of that    but really retaining that childlike quality of not caring what other people think about what you're interested in  is really critical. The next element is the fact that I have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life. And so  life is more valuable than no life. And so I think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach. I'm very interested in Mars  of course  and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the Viking Landers landed on Mars. And that took what had been a tiny little astronomical object in the sky  that you would see as a dot  and turned it completely into a landscape  as that very first primitive picture came rastering across the screen. And when it became a landscape  it also became a destination  and altered  really  the course of my life. In my graduate years I worked with my colleague and mentor and friend  Steve Schneider  at the National Center for Atmospheric Research  working on global change issues. We've written a number of things on the role of Gaia hypothesis    whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity in any meaningful scientific sense  and then  as an outgrowth of that  I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war. So  wonderful things and grim things. But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes  not just as our home. And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective  to try to then think about the way our planet behaves  as a planet  and with the life that's on it. And all of this seems to me to be a salient point in history. We're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond. So  back to Mars. How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars  Well  sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other  even on this planet. So  finding life on another planet is a non trivial occupation and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that. Whether or not you think it's likely to be successful sort of depends on what you think about the chances of life in the universe. I think  myself  that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time. So  you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen  and then you get helium  and then you get more complicated stuff  and you get planets forming    and life is a common  planetary based phenomenon  in my view. Certainly  in the last    years  we've seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed  and just last month  a couple of weeks ago  a planet in the size class of Earth has actually been found. And so this is very exciting news. So  my first bold prediction is that  is that in the universe  life is going to be everywhere. It's going to be everywhere we look    where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it. And those planetary systems are going to be very common. So  what about life on Mars  Well  if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be  I would've probably said  a couple of percent. And even that was considered outrageous at the time. I was once sneeringly introduced by a former NASA official  as the only person on the planet who still thought there was life on Mars. Of course  that official is now dead  and I'm not  so there's a certain amount of glory in outliving your adversaries. But things have changed greatly over the last dozen years. And the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information. The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '    and the MER Rover missions that are on Mars as we speak now and the European Space Agency's Mars Express  has taught us a number of amazing things. There is sub surface ice on that planet. And so where there is water  there is a very high chance of our kind of life. There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place   one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed  and there are these amazing structures called blueberries  which are these little  rocky concretions that we are busy making biologically in my lab right now. So  with all of these things put together  I think that the chances of life are much greater than I would've ever thought. I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars  sometime in its past  is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half. So this is a very bold statement. I think it's there  and I think we need to go look for it  and I think it's underground. So the game's afoot  and this is the game that we play in astro biology. How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life  How do you plan to look for it  How do you know it when you find it  Because if it's big and obvious  we would've already found it    it would've already bitten us on the foot  and it hasn't. So  we know that it's probably quite cryptic. Very critically  how do we protect it  if we find it  and not contaminate it  And also  even perhaps more critically  because this is the only home planet we have  how do we protect us from it  while we study it  So why might it be hard to find  Well  it's probably microscopic  and it's never easy to study microscopic things  although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth  at much smaller scales than ever before. But it's probably hiding  because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment  that makes you yummy  and other things might want to eat you  or consume you. And so  there's a game of predator prey that's going to be  essentially  universal  really  in any kind of biological system. It also may be very  very different in its fundamental properties   its chemistry  or its size. We say small  but what does that mean  Is it virus sized  Is it smaller than that  Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium  We don't know. And speed of activity  which is something that we face in our work with sub surface organisms  because they grow very  very slowly. If I were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a Petri plate  within about four or five hours  I would have to see growth. But the organisms that we work with  from the sub surface of Earth  very often it's months    and in many cases  years    before we see any growth whatsoever. So they are  intrinsically  a slower life form. But the real issue is that we are guided by our limited experience  and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know  then we can't recognize what to look for  or how to plan for it. So  perspective is everything and  because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about  I have learned to think about Earth as an extraterrestrial planet. And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things. This is my favorite game on airplanes  where you're in an airplane and you look out the window  you see the horizon. I always turn my head on the side  and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home  to seeing it as a planet. It's a very simple trick  and I never fail to do it when I'm sitting in a window seat. Well  this is what we apply to our work. This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in. This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco  in Mexico  and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid. There is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide coming into this cave from volcanic sources and from the breakdown of evaporite    minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed    and it is a completely hostile environment for us. We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear  and    parts per million of H S will kill you. This is regularly several hundred parts per million. So  it's a very hazardous environment  with CO as well  and many other gases. These extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special. Because contrary to what you might think  this is not devoid of life. This is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet  anywhere. It's bursting with life. The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right  but one of the reasons that we're interested in them is because they represent  really  the average conditions that we may expect on other planets. So  this is part of the ability that we have  to try to stretch our imagination  in terms of what we may find in the future. There's so much life in this cave  and I can't even begin to scratch the surface of it with you. But one of the most famous objects out of this are what we call Snottites  for obvious reasons. This stuff looks like what comes out of your two year old's nose when he has a cold. And this is produced by bacteria who are actually making more sulfuric acid  and living at pHs right around zero. And so  this stuff is like battery acid. And yet  everything in this cave has adapted to it. In fact  there's so much energy available for biology in this cave  that there's actually a huge number of cavefish. And the local Zoque Indians harvest this twice a year  as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration. This is very unusual for caves. In some of the other amazing caves that we work in    this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad  and this is one of the most famous caves in the world. It's     miles of mapped passage  it's pristine  it has no natural opening and it's a gigantic biological  geo microbiological laboratory. In this cave  great areas are covered by this reddish material that you see here  and also these enormous crystals of selenite that you can see dangling down. This stuff is produced biologically. This is the breakdown product of the bedrock  that organisms are busy munching their way through. They take iron and manganese minerals within the bedrock and they oxidize them. And every time they do that  they get a tiny little packet of energy. And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use  then  to run their life processes. Interestingly enough  they also do this with uranium and chromium  and various other toxic metals. And so  the obvious avenue for bio remediation comes from organisms like this. These organisms we now bring into the lab  and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates  and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves. So  these are signals that they leave in the rock record. Well  even in basalt surfaces in lava tube caves  which are a by product of volcanic activity  we find these walls totally covered  in many cases  by these beautiful  glistening silver walls  or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold. And these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria. And you can see in these central images here  scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys    these are gardens of these bacteria. One of the interesting things about these particular guys is that they're in the actinomycete and streptomycete groups of the bacteria  which is where we get most of our antibiotics. The sub surface of Earth contains a vast biodiversity. And these organisms  because they're very separate from the surface  make a vast array of novel compounds. And so  the potential for exploiting this for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses is completely untapped  but probably exceeds most of the rest of the biodiversity of the planet. So  lava tube caves   I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet. We know that on Mars and the Moon there are tons of these structures. We can see them. On the left you can see a lava tube forming at a recent eruption    Mount Etna in Sicily    and this is the way these tubes form. And when they hollow out  then they become habitats for organisms. These are all over the planet Mars  and we're busy cataloguing them now. And so  there's very interesting cave real estate on Mars  at least of that type. In order to access these sub surface environments that we're interested in  we're very interested in developing the tools to do this. You know  it's not easy to get into these caves. It requires crawling  climbing  rope work  technical rope work and many other complex human motions in order to access these. We face the problem of  how can we do this robotically  Why would we want to do it robotically  Well  we're going to be sending robotic missions to Mars long in advance of human missions. And then  secondly  getting back to that earlier point that I made about the preciousness of any life that we may find on Mars  we don't want to contaminate it. And one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it is to have an intermediary. And in this case  we're imagining intermediary robotic devices that can actually do some of that front end work for us  to protect any potential life that we find. I'm not going to go through all of these projects now  but we're involved in about half a dozen robotic development projects  in collaboration with a number of different groups. I want to talk specifically about the array that you see on the top. These are hopping microbot swarms. I'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT  and we have come up with the idea of having little  jumping bean like robots that are propelled by artificial muscle  which is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties    are the EPAMs  or artificial muscles. And these allow them to hop. They behave with a swarm behavior  where they relate to each other  modeled after insect swarm behavior  and they could be made very numerous. And so  one can send a thousand of them  as you can see in this upper left hand picture  a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current MER Rovers. And these little guys    you could lose many of them. If you send a thousand of them  you could probably get rid of    percent of them and still have a mission. And so  that allows you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make your way where you want to go. Now  to wrap this up  I want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves. It occurred to us a number of years ago that caves have many properties that people have used and other organisms have used as habitat in the past. And perhaps it's time we started to explore those  in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration. So  we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study  looking at the irreducible set of technologies that you would need in order to actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes on the Moon or Mars. It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list  and we have gone in the relatively primitive technology direction. So  we're talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave  foamed in place airlocks to deal with this complex topology  various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies. And the future is there for us to use these lava tube caves on Mars. And right now we're in caves  and we're doing science and recreation  but I think in the future we'll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies. Now  my view of what the current status of potential life on Mars is that it's probably been on the planet  maybe one in two chances. The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied  because we now know  from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth  that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets. One of the burning questions  of course  is if we go there and find life in the sub surface  as I fully expect that we will  is that a second genesis of life  Did life start here and was it transported there  Did it start there and get transported here  This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half century  and where I expect that we will have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions. Thank you.\n",
      "We're at a tipping point in human history  a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home. Even in just the past few years  we've greatly expanded our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe. NASA's Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars  indicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy. Kepler is a space telescope that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them  blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us. Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes as well as their distance from their parent star. Together  this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky  like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System  and also how much light they receive from their parent sun. In turn  this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habitable or not. Unfortunately  at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds  our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity.      was the hottest year on record. Glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades. These planetary scale environmental  changes that we have set in motion are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course. But I'm not a climate scientist  I'm an astronomer. I study planetary habitability as influenced by stars with the hopes of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet. You could say that I look for choice alien real estate. Now  as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe  I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth  the more you appreciate our own planet itself. Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best  those of our own Solar System. Consider our neighbor  Mars. Mars is small and rocky  and though it's a bit far from the Sun  it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler. Indeed  it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past  and in part  this is why we study Mars so much. Our rovers  like Curiosity  crawl across its surface  scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it. Orbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere  trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability. Private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars. But though these Martian vistas resemble the deserts of our own home world  places that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers  compared to Earth Mars is a pretty terrible place to live. Consider the extent to which we have not colonized the deserts of our own planet  places that are lush by comparison with Mars. Even in the driest  highest places on Earth  the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests. I worry    I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets carries with it a long  dark shadow  the implication and belief by some that Mars will be there to save us from the self inflicted destruction of the only truly habitable planet we know of  the Earth. As much as I love interplanetary exploration  I deeply disagree with this idea. There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars  but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party is happening later on the lifeboats. Thank you. But the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation are not opposed to one another. No  they're in fact two sides of the same goal  to understand  preserve and improve life into the future. The extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas. They're just closer to home. If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile  inhospitable spaces here on Earth  perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it. I leave you with a final thought experiment  Fermi's paradox. Many years ago  the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that  given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it  we should have found evidence for alien life by now. So where are they  Well  one possible solution to Fermi's paradox is that  as civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars  they lose sight of how important it is to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with. It is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves  but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together. If we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation  then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving the habitability of the Earth. Thank you.\n",

      "So I grew up in East Los Angeles  not even realizing I was poor. My dad was a high ranking gang member who ran the streets. Everyone knew who I was  so I thought I was a pretty big deal  and I was protected  and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail  I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent. She worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean's office  so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class  for whatever reason  who were waiting to be disciplined. Man  her office was packed. So  see  kids like us  we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school  and sometimes we're just not ready to focus. But that doesn't mean that we can't. It just takes a little bit more. Like  I remember one day I found my dad convulsing  foaming at the mouth  OD ing on the bathroom floor. Really  do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list  Not so much. But I really needed a support network  a group of people who were going to help me make sure that I wasn't going to be a victim of my own circumstance  that they were going to push me beyond what I even thought I could do. I needed teachers  in the classroom  every day  who were going to say   You can move beyond that.  And unfortunately  the local junior high was not going to offer that. It was gang infested  huge teacher turnover rate. So my mom said   You're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day.  So for the next two years  that's what I did. I took a school bus to the fancy side of town. And eventually  I ended up at a school where there was a mixture. There were some people who were really gang affiliated  and then there were those of us really trying to make it to high school. Well  trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable. You had to survive. You just had to do things sometimes. So there were a lot of teachers who were like   She's never going to make it. She has an issue with authority. She's not going to go anywhere.  Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause. But then  they were very surprised when I graduated from high school. I was accepted to Pepperdine University  and I came back to the same school that I attended to be a special ed assistant. And then I told them   I want to be a teacher.  And boy  they were like   What  Why  Why would you want to do that   So I began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that I attended  and I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me. And so every year  I share my background with my kids  because they need to know that everyone has a story  everyone has a struggle  and everyone needs help along the way. And I am going to be their help along the way. So as a rookie teacher  I created opportunity. I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before. I was like   You need to go to a hospital  the school nurse  something.  He's like   No  Miss  I'm not going. I need to be in class because I need to graduate.  So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance  but we were going to push forward and keep moving on. And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they're going through  getting to know their families    I wanted that  but I couldn't do it in a school with       kids  and teachers turning over year after year after year. How do you get to build those relationships  So we created a new school. And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media. And we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding  for support. But with that  we were going to gain freedom  freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective  freedom to control the curriculum so that we're not doing lesson  .  on page five  no  and freedom to control a budget  to spend money where it matters  not how a district or a state says you have to do it. We wanted those freedoms. But now  shifting an entire paradigm  it hasn't been an easy journey  nor is it even complete. But we had to do it. Our community deserved a new way of doing things. And as the very first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District  you better believe there was some opposition. And it was out of fear    fear of  well  what if they get it wrong  Yeah  what if we get it wrong  But what if we get it right  And we did. So even though teachers were against it because we employ one year contracts    you can't teach  or you don't want to teach  you don't get to be at my school with my kids. So in our third year  how did we do it  Well  we're making school worth coming to every day. We make our kids feel like they matter to us. We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them  and they use all the technology that they're used to. Laptops  computers  tablets    you name it  they have it. Animation  software  moviemaking software  they have it all. And because we connect it to what they're doing   For example  they made public service announcements for the Cancer Society. These were played in the local trolley system. Teaching elements of persuasion  it doesn't get any more real than that. Our state test scores have gone up more than    points since we've become our own school. But it's taken all stakeholders  working together    teachers and principals on one year contracts  working over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation. And it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say   Know  the district is trying to impose this  but you have the freedom to do otherwise.  And it takes an active parent center who is not only there  showing a presence every day  but who is part of our governance  making decisions for their kids  our kids. Because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live  They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood  a school that they can be proud to say they attend  and a school that the community can be proud of as well  and they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances. Because it's time that kids like me stop being the exception  and we become the norm. Thank you.\n",
      "When I was    years old  I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding  teaching. I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher  I made quizzes and tests. I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back  I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking. The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math  sure  they're hard  ratios  decimals  the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible  and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching  I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective  from a psychological perspective. In education  the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily  So I left the classroom  and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings  and in every study my question was  who is successful here and why  My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods  asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year  and of those  who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students  We partnered with private companies  asking  which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs  And who's going to earn the most money  In all those very different contexts  one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks  physical health  and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future  day in  day out  not just for the week  not just for the month  but for years  and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon  not a sprint. A few years ago  I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires  and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate  even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure  things like family income  standardized achievement test scores  even how safe kids felt when they were at school. So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school  especially for kids at risk for dropping out. To me  the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know  how little science knows  about building it. Every day  parents and teachers ask me   How do I build grit in kids  What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic  How do I keep them motivated for the long run   The honest answer is  I don't know. What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. In fact  in our data  grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. So far  the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called  growth mindset.  This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck  and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed  that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge  they're much more likely to persevere when they fail  because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit. But we need more. And that's where I'm going to end my remarks  because that's where we are. That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas  our strongest intuitions  and we need to test them. We need to measure whether we've been successful  and we have to be willing to fail  to be wrong  to start over again with lessons learned. In other words  we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you.\n",
      "I have been teaching for a long time  and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students. In       my grandmother    bottom left for you guys over here    graduated from the eighth grade. She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived. It was in the books  it was inside the teacher's head  and she needed to go there to get the information  because that's how you learned. Fast forward a generation  this is the one room schoolhouse  Oak Grove  where my father went to a one room schoolhouse. And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher  stored it in the only portable memory he has  which is inside his own head  and take it with him  because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world. When I was a kid  we had a set of encyclopedias at my house. It was purchased the year I was born  and it was extraordinary  because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information. The information was inside my house and it was awesome. This was different than either generation had experienced before  and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. But the information was closer to me. I could get access to it. In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching  we really see the advent of the Internet. Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool  I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas  small town Kansas  where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely  small town  rural Kansas school district  where I was teaching my favorite subject  American government. My first year    super gung ho    going to teach American government  loved the political system. Kids in the   th grade  not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system. Year two  learned a few things    had to change my tactic. And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves. I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it. I posed a problem in front of them  which was to put on an election forum for their own community. They produced flyers. They called offices. They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries. They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates. They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well  and really had this robust experiential learning. The older teachers    more experienced    looked at me and went   Oh  there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done.   She doesn't know what she's in for.  But I knew that the kids would show up  and I believed it  and I told them every week what I expected out of them. And that night  all    kids    dressed appropriately  doing their job  owning it. I had to just sit and watch. It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic. It meant something to them. And they will step up. From Kansas  I moved on to lovely Arizona  where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years  this time with middle school students. Luckily  I didn't have to teach them American government. Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography. Again   thrilled  to learn. But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona  was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school  and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities. And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina  which is the gentleman that the movie  Hotel Rwanda  is based after. And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us. We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses. There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip. The problem then becomes how do you take seventh  and eighth graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful  and they know what to do with it. And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive. I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life  or in their own story  or in their own world  that they could identify that had done a similar thing. I asked them to produce a little movie about it. It's the first time we'd done this. Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer  but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it. It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves  what they're willing to share. The last question of the assignment is  how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people  The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary. Fast forward to Pennsylvania  where I find myself today. I teach at the Science Leadership Academy  which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia. We are a nine through    public school  but we do school quite differently. I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned  and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past  of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school  and to a moment when we have information surplus. So what do you do when the information is all around you  Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information  In Philadelphia we have a one to one laptop program  so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday  taking them home  getting access to information. And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students  is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process. We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test  and I am here to share with you  it is not learning. That is the absolute wrong thing to ask  to tell kids to never be wrong. To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn. So we did this project  and this is one of the artifacts of the project. I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure. My students produced these info graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill. I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info graphics that existed in a lot of mass media  and take a look at what were the interesting components of it  and produce one for themselves of a different man made disaster from American history. And they had certain criteria to do it. They were a little uncomfortable with it  because we'd never done this before  and they didn't know exactly how to do it. They can talk    they're very smooth  and they can write very  very well  but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them. But I gave them the room to just do the thing. Go create. Go figure it out. Let's see what we can do. And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint. This was done in like two or three days. And this is the work of the student that consistently did it. And when I sat the students down  I said   Who's got the best one   And they immediately went   There it is.  Didn't read anything.  There it is.  And I said   Well what makes it great   And they're like   Oh  the design's good  and he's using good color. And there's some ...   And they went through all that we processed out loud. And I said   Go read it.  And they're like   Oh  that one wasn't so awesome.  And then we went to another one    it didn't have great visuals  but it had great information    and spent an hour talking about the learning process  because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect  or whether or not it was what I could create. It asked them to create for themselves  and it allowed them to fail  process  learn from. And when we do another round of this in my class this year  they will do better this time  because learning has to include an amount of failure  because failure is instructional in the process. There are a million pictures that I could click through here  and had to choose carefully    this is one of my favorites    of students learning  of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information  but instead  ask them what they can do with it. Ask them really interesting questions. They will not disappoint. Ask them to go to places  to see things for themselves  to actually experience the learning  to play  to inquire. This is one of my favorite photos  because this was taken on Tuesday  when I asked the students to go to the polls. This is Robbie  and this was his first day of voting  and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that. But this is learning too  because we asked them to go out into real spaces. The main point is that  if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning  empowering student voice and embracing failure  we're missing the mark. And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities  because we won't get there with a standardized test  and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer. We know how to do this better  and it's time to do better.\n",
      "It was November          my first day as a principal  but hardly my first day in the school district of Philadelphia. I graduated from Philadelphia public schools  and I went on to teach special education for    years in a low income  low performing school in North Philadelphia  where crime is rampant and deep poverty is among the highest in the nation. Shortly after I walked into my new school  a huge fight broke out among the girls. After things were quickly under control  I immediately called a meeting in the school's auditorium to introduce myself as the school's new principal. I walked in angry  a little nervous    but I was determined to set the tone for my new students. I started listing as forcefully as I could my expectations for their behavior and my expectations for what they would learn in school. When  all of a sudden  a girl way in the back of the auditorium  she stood up and she said   Miss  Miss   When our eyes locked  she said   Why do you keep calling this a school  This is not a school.  In one outburst  Ashley had expressed what I felt and never quite was able to articulate about my own experience when I attended a low performing school in the same neighborhood  many  many  many years earlier. That school was definitely not a school. Fast forwarding a decade later to       I was entering my third low performing school as principal. I was to be Strawberry Mansion's fourth principal in four years. It was labeled  low performing and persistently dangerous  due to its low test scores and high number of weapons  drugs  assaults and arrests. Shortly as I approached the door of my new school and attempted to enter  and found the door locked with chains  I could hear Ashley's voice in my ears going   Miss  Miss  This is not a school.  The halls were dim and dark from poor lighting. There were tons of piles of broken old furniture and desks in the classrooms  and there were thousands of unused materials and resources. This was not a school. As the year progressed  I noticed that the classrooms were nearly empty. The students were just scared  scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen  scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food. They were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying. This was not a school. And then  there were the teachers  who were incredibly afraid for their own safety  so they had low expectations for the students and themselves  and they were totally unaware of their role in the destruction of the school's culture. This was the most troubling of all. You see  Ashley was right  and not just about her school. For far too many schools  for kids who live in poverty  their schools are really not schools at all. But this can change. Let me tell you how it's being done at Strawberry Mansion High School. Anybody who's ever worked with me will tell you I am known for my slogans. So today  I am going to use three that have been paramount in our quest for change. My first slogan is  if you're going to lead  lead. I always believed that what happens in a school and what does not happen in a school is up to the principal. I am the principal  and having that title required me to lead. I was not going to stay in my office  I was not going to delegate my work  and I was not going to be afraid to address anything that was not good for children  whether that made me liked or not. I am a leader  so I know I cannot do anything alone. So  I assembled a top notch leadership team who believed in the possibility of all the children  and together  we tackled the small things  like resetting every single locker combination by hand so that every student could have a secure locker. We decorated every bulletin board in that building with bright  colorful  and positive messages. We took the chains off the front doors of the school. We got the lightbulbs replaced  and we cleaned every classroom to its core  recycling every  every textbook that was not needed  and discarded thousands of old materials and furniture. We used two dumpsters per day. And  of course  of course  we tackled the big stuff  like rehauling the entire school budget so that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff. We rebuilt the entire school day schedule from scratch to add a variety of start and end times  remediation  honors courses  extracurricular activities  and counseling  all during the school day. All during the school day. We created a deployment plan that specified where every single support person and police officer would be every minute of the day  and we monitored at every second of the day  and  our best invention ever  we devised a schoolwide discipline program titled  Non negotiables.  It was a behavior system    designed to promote positive behavior at all times. The results  Strawberry Mansion was removed from the Persistently Dangerous List our first year after being    after being on the Persistently Dangerous List for five consecutive years. Leaders make the impossible possible. That brings me to my second slogan  So what  Now what  When we looked at the data  and we met with the staff  there were many excuses for why Strawberry Mansion was low performing and persistently dangerous. They said that only    percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis      percent of them live in poverty  only one percent of the parents participate  many of the children come from incarceration and single parent homes     percent of the students have special needs  and the state data revealed that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra  and    were proficient in literature. After they got through telling us all the stories of how awful the conditions and the children were  I looked at them  and I said   So what. Now what  What are we gonna do about it   Eliminating excuses at every turn became my primary responsibility. We addressed every one of those excuses through a mandatory professional development  paving the way for intense focus on teaching and learning. After many observations  what we determined was that teachers knew what to teach but they did not know how to teach so many children with so many vast abilities. So  we developed a lesson delivery model for instruction that focused on small group instruction  making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met in the classroom. The results  After one year  state data revealed that our scores have grown by     percent in Algebra and     percent in literature. We have a very long way to go  a very long way to go  but we now approach every obstacle with a  So What. Now What   attitude. And that brings me to my third and final slogan. If nobody told you they loved you today  you remember I do  and I always will. My students have problems  social  emotional and economic problems you could never imagine. Some of them are parents themselves  and some are completely alone. If someone asked me my real secret for how I truly keep Strawberry Mansion moving forward  I would have to say that I love my students and I believe in their possibilities unconditionally. When I look at them  I can only see what they can become  and that is because I am one of them. I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too. I know what it feels like to go to a school that's not a school. I know what it feels like to wonder if there's ever going to be any way out of poverty. But because of my amazing mother  I got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me. So    if I'm going to push my students toward their dream and their purpose in life  I've got to get to know who they are. So I have to spend time with them  so I manage the lunchroom every day. And while I'm there  I talk to them about deeply personal things  and when it's their birthday  I sing  Happy Birthday  even though I cannot sing at all. I often ask them   Why do you want me to sing when I cannot sing at all   And they respond by saying   Because we like feeling special.  We hold monthly town hall meetings to listen to their concerns  to find out what is on their minds. They ask us questions like   Why do we have to follow rules    Why are there so many consequences    Why can't we just do what we want to do   They ask  and I answer each question honestly  and this exchange in listening helps to clear up any misconceptions. Every moment is a teachable moment. My reward  my reward for being non negotiable in my rules and consequences is their earned respect. I insist on it  and because of this  we can accomplish things together. They are clear about my expectations for them  and I repeat those expectations every day over the P.A. system. I remind them    I remind them of those core values of focus  tradition  excellence  integrity and perseverance  and I remind them every day how education can truly change their lives. And I end every announcement the same   If nobody told you they loved you today  you remember I do  and I always will.  Ashley's words of  Miss  Miss  this is not a school   is forever etched in my mind. If we are truly going to make real progress in addressing poverty  then we have to make sure that every school that serves children in poverty is a real school  a school  a school    a school that provides them with knowledge and mental training to navigate the world around them. I do not know all the answers  but what I do know is for those of us who are privileged and have the responsibility of leading a school that serves children in poverty  we must truly lead  and when we are faced with unbelievable challenges  we must stop and ask ourselves   So what. Now what  What are we going to do about it   And as we lead  we must never forget that every single one of our students is just a child  often scared by what the world tells them they should be  and no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be  we should always provide them with hope  our undivided attention  unwavering belief in their potential  consistent expectations  and we must tell them often  if nobody told them they loved them today  remember we do  and we always will. Thank you. Thank you  Jesus.\n",
      "Radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education. We have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity. But I want to tell you the story of PISA  OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills of    year olds around the world  and it's really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy. Look at how the world looked in the     s  in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school. You can see the United States ahead of everyone else  and much of the economic success of the United States draws on its long standing advantage as the first mover in education. But in the     s  some countries caught up. In the     s  the global expansion of the talent pool continued. And the world didn't stop in the     s. So in the '  s  the U.S. was first. In the '  s  it was   th  and not because standards had fallen  but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere. Korea shows you what's possible in education. Two generations ago  Korea had the standard of living of Afghanistan today  and was one of the lowest education performers. Today  every young Korean finishes high school. So this tells us that  in a global economy  it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success  but the best performing education systems internationally. The trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do. Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets  while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need. And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives. So with PISA  we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly. And we took a very special angle to this. We were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school  but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations. Now  some people have criticized us for this. They say  you know  such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people  because we test students with problems they haven't seen before. But if you take that logic  you know  you should consider life unfair  because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school  but whether we are prepared for change  whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created  to use technologies that haven't been invented  to solve problems we just can't anticipate today. And once hotly contested  our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard. In our latest assessment in       we measured    school systems that together cover    percent of the economy. This chart shows you the performance of countries. In red  sort of below OECD average. Yellow is so so  and in green are the countries doing really well. You can see Shanghai  Korea  Singapore in Asia  Finland in Europe  Canada in North America doing really well. You can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between    year olds in Shanghai and    year olds in Chile  and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance. There's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today's economy. But I want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture. Educators like to talk about equity. With PISA  we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity  in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances. And we see that in some countries  the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very  very strong. Opportunities are unequally distributed. A lot of potential of young children is wasted. We see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you're born. We all want to be there  in the upper right quadrant  where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed. Nobody  and no country  can afford to be there  where performance is poor and there are large social disparities. And then we can debate  you know  is it better to be there  where performance is strong at the price of large disparities  Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity  But actually  if you look at how countries come out on this picture  you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity. In fact  one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence. These countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all  a very important lesson. And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people. And ever since those results came out  policymakers  educators  researchers from around the world have tried to figure out what's behind the success of those systems. But let's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started PISA  and I'm giving them a colored bubble now. And I'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students. If money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes  you would find all the large bubbles at the top  no  But that's not what you see. Spending per student only explains about  well  less than    percent of the performance variation among countries  and Luxembourg  for example  the most expensive system  doesn't do particularly well. What you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results. You also see    and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings    that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well educated countries  and poor and badly educated ones  a very  very important lesson. Let's look at this in greater detail. The red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country's wealth. One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well  and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession. And Korea also invests into long school days  which drives up costs further. Last but not least  Koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop. They invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things. All that costs money. How can Korea afford all of this  The answer is  students in Korea learn in large classes. This is the blue bar which is driving costs down. You go to the next country on the list  Luxembourg  and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea  so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does. But  you know  parents and teachers and policymakers in Luxembourg all like small classes. You know  it's very pleasant to walk into a small class. So they have invested all their money into there  and the blue bar  class size  is driving costs up. But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once  and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well. Students don't have long hours of learning. And basically  teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching. So you can see two countries spent their money very differently  and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education. Let's go back to the year     . Remember  that was the year before the iPod was invented. This is how the world looked then in terms of PISA performance. The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller  no  We spent a lot less on education  about    percent less on education. So you ask yourself  if education has become so much more expensive  has it become so much better  And the bitter truth really is that  you know  not in many countries. But there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements. Germany  my own country  in the year       featured in the lower quadrant  below average performance  large social disparities. And remember  Germany  we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees. Very disappointing results. People were stunned by the results. And for the very first time  the public debate in Germany was dominated for months by education  not tax  not other kinds of issues  but education was the center of the public debate. And then policymakers began to respond to this. The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education. A lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage. And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies  but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education. For example  traditionally  the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families  and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten. PISA has transformed that debate  and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany. Or traditionally  the German education divides children at the age of     very young children  between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers  and that mainly along socioeconomic lines  and that paradigm is being challenged now too. A lot of change. And the good news is  nine years later  you can see improvements in quality and equity. People have taken up the challenge  done something about it. Or take Korea  at the other end of the spectrum. In the year       Korea did already very well  but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence. They took up the challenge  and Korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading. Well  if you only focus on your brightest students  you know what happens is disparities grow  and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction  but still  an impressive improvement. A major overhaul of Poland's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools  turn around many of the lowest performing schools  and raise performance by over half a school year. And you can see other countries as well. Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system  raise quality and improve equity  and so did Hungary. So what you can actually see  there's been a lot of change. And even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture  of economic factors  of social issues  of homogeneity of societies  and so on  these people must now concede that education improvement is possible. You know  Poland hasn't changed its culture. It didn't change its economy. It didn't change the compositions of its population. It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies and practice. Very impressive. And all that raises  of course  the question  What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity  high levels of performance  and raised outcomes  And  of course  the question is  can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere  Of course  you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale  but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high performing systems share. Everybody agrees that education is important. Everybody says that. But the test of truth is  how do you weigh that priority against other priorities  How do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers  Would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer  How do the media talk about schools and teachers  Those are the critical questions  and what we have learned from PISA is that  in high performing education systems  the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education  their future  more than consumption today. And you know what's interesting  You won't believe it  but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school. Those things really exist. But placing a high value on education is just part of the picture. The other part is the belief that all children are capable of success. You have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages. You know  students are divided up  reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world class standards. But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities. If you go to Japan in Asia  or Finland in Europe  parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed  and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior. When we asked students what counts for success in mathematics  students in North America would typically tell us  you know  it's all about talent. If I'm not born as a genius in math  I'd better study something else. Nine out of    Japanese students say that it depends on my own investment  on my own effort  and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them. In the past  different students were taught in similar ways. High performers on PISA embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices. They realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents  and they personalize learning opportunities. High performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum. Every student knows what matters. Every student knows what's required to be successful. And nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers. High performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them. They watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling  and how they structure teacher pay. They provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice. And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers. In bureaucratic school systems  teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching. High performing systems are very clear what good performance is. They set very ambitious standards  but then they enable their teachers to figure out  what do I need to teach to my students today  The past was about delivered wisdom in education. Now the challenge is to enable user generated wisdom. High performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control    sort of  how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education    to professional forms of work organization. They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy. They provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices. The goal of the past was standardization and compliance. High performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive. In the past  the policy focus was on outcomes  on provision. The high performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher  the next school around their lives. And the most impressive outcomes of world class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system. You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA  but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools. Every school succeeds. This is where success is systemic. And how do they do that  They invest resources where they can make the most difference. They attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools  and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom. Last but not least  those countries align policies across all areas of public policy. They make them coherent over sustained periods of time  and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented. Now  knowing what successful systems are doing doesn't yet tell us how to improve. That's also clear  and that's where some of the limits of international comparisons of PISA are. That's where other forms of research need to kick in  and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into telling countries what they should be doing. But its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing. And the example of PISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems. You know  some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards. You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this.  Laughter  But PISA has shown what's possible in education. It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible. It has taken away excuses from those who are complacent. And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders. If we can help every child  every teacher  every school  every principal  every parent see what improvement is possible  that only the sky is the limit to education improvement  we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives.

      "Time flies. It's actually almost    years ago when I wanted to reframe the way we use information  the way we work together  I invented the World Wide Web. Now     years on  at TED  I want to ask your help in a new reframing. So going back to       I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system. Nobody really did anything with it  pretty much. But    months later    this is how innovation happens       months later  my boss said I could do it on the side  as a sort of a play project  kick the tires of a new computer we'd got. And so he gave me the time to code it up. So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like  hypertext protocol  HTTP  the idea of URLs  these names for things which started with HTTP. I wrote the code and put it out there. Why did I do it  Well  it was basically frustration. I was frustrated    I was working as a software engineer in this huge  very exciting lab  lots of people coming from all over the world. They brought all sorts of different computers with them. They had all sorts of different data formats  all sorts  all kinds of documentation systems. So that  in all that diversity  if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this  everything I looked into  I had to connect to some new machine  I had to learn to run some new program  I would find the information I wanted in some new data format. And these were all incompatible. It was just very frustrating. The frustration was all this unlocked potential. In fact  on all these discs there were documents. So if you just imagined them all being part of some big  virtual documentation system in the sky  say on the Internet  then life would be so much easier. Well  once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo    actually he did  it was found after he died  his copy. He had written   Vague  but exciting   in pencil  in the corner. But in general it was difficult    it was really difficult to explain what the web was like. It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then. But then    OK  when TED started  there was no web so things like  click  didn't have the same meaning. I can show somebody a piece of hypertext  a page which has got links  and we click on the link and bing    there'll be another hypertext page. Not impressive. You know  we've seen that    we've got things on hypertext on CD ROMs. What was difficult was to get them to imagine  so  imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine. Alright  that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make. Well  some people did. So yeah  it was difficult to explain  but there was a grassroots movement. And that is what has made it most fun. That has been the most exciting thing  not the technology  not the things people have done with it  but actually the community  the spirit of all these people getting together  sending the emails. That's what it was like then. Do you know what  It's funny  but right now it's kind of like that again. I asked everybody  more or less  to put their documents    I said   Could you put your documents on this web thing   And you did. Thanks. It's been a blast  hasn't it  I mean  it has been quite interesting because we've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away. They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little  initial website that we started off with. Now  I want you to put your data on the web. Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential. There is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data. What do you mean   data   What's the difference    documents  data  Well  documents you read  OK  More or less  you read them  you can follow links from them  and that's it. Data    you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer. Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk  One of the great    yes a lot of people have seen it    one of the great TED Talks. Hans put up this presentation in which he showed  for various different countries  in various different colors    he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality  and he shot this thing animated through time. So  he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world. He put up a slide a little bit like this. It had underground all the data OK  data is brown and boxy and boring  and that's how we think of it  isn't it  Because data you can't naturally use by itself But in fact  data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it. In this case  Hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things. He had put it together  combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this software  which I think his son developed  originally  and produces this wonderful presentation. And Hans made a point of saying   Look  it's really important to have a lot of data.  And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying  very forcibly   It's really important to have a lot of data.  So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected  or six like he did  but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data. The technology is linked data  and it's extremely simple. If you want to put something on the web there are three rules  first thing is that those HTTP names    those things that start with  http      we're using them not just for documents now  we're using them for things that the documents are about. We're using them for people  we're using them for places  we're using them for your products  we're using them for events. All kinds of conceptual things  they have names now that start with HTTP. Second rule  if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web  I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing  about that event. Who's at the event  Whatever it is about that person  where they were born  things like that. So the second rule is I get important information back. Third rule is that when I get back that information it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born  it's got relationships. Data is relationships. Interestingly  data is relationships. This person was born in Berlin  Berlin is in Germany. And when it has relationships  whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it's related to is given one of those names that starts HTTP. So  I can go ahead and look that thing up. So I look up a person    I can look up then the city where they were born  then I can look up the region it's in  and the town it's in  and the population of it  and so on. So I can browse this stuff. So that's it  really. That is linked data. I wrote an article entitled  Linked Data  a couple of years ago and soon after that  things started to happen. The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had  and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting. It's not just a whole lot of other plants. It's not just a root supplying a plant  but for each of those plants  whatever it is    a presentation  an analysis  somebody's looking for patterns in the data    they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together  and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together  the more powerful it is. So  linked data. The meme went out there. And  pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up  he noticed that Wikipedia    you know Wikipedia  the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it. Well  in those documents  there are little squares  little boxes. And in most information boxes  there's data. So he wrote a program to take the data  extract it from Wikipedia  and put it into a blob of linked data on the web  which he called dbpedia. Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up Berlin  you'll find that there are other blobs of data which also have stuff about Berlin  and they're linked together. So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin  you'll end up pulling up these other things as well. And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow. This is just the grassroots stuff again  OK  Let's think about data for a bit. Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms. Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there. So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data. We could talk about government data  enterprise data is really important  there's scientific data  there's personal data  there's weather data  there's data about events  there's data about talks  and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff. I'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it  so that you also see how much unlocked potential. Let's start with government data. Barack Obama said in a speech  that he    American government data would be available on the Internet in accessible formats. And I hope that they will put it up as linked data. That's important. Why is it important  Not just for transparency  yeah transparency in government is important  but that data    this is the data from all the government departments Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America. It's actual useful. It's got value. I can use it in my company. I could use it as a kid to do my homework. So we're talking about making the place  making the world run better by making this data available. In fact if you're responsible    if you know about some data in a government department  often you find that these people  they're very tempted to keep it    Hans calls it database hugging. You hug your database  you don't want to let it go until you've made a beautiful website for it. Well  I'd like to suggest that rather    yes  make a beautiful website  who am I to say don't make a beautiful website  Make a beautiful website  but first give us the unadulterated data  we want the data. We want unadulterated data. OK  we have to ask for raw data now. And I'm going to ask you to practice that  OK  Can you say  raw   Audience  Raw. Tim Berners Lee  Can you say  data   Audience  Data. TBL  Can you say  now   Audience  Now  TBL  Alright   raw data now   Audience  Raw data now  Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you  even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer. And it's not just America. It's all over the world. And it's not just governments  of course    it's enterprises as well. So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data. Here we are at TED  and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now    curing cancer  understanding the brain for Alzheimer's  understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable  understanding how the world works. The people who are going to solve those    the scientists    they have half formed ideas in their head  they try to communicate those over the web. But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases  often sitting in their computers  and actually  currently not shared. In fact  I'll just go into one area    if you're looking at Alzheimer's  for example  drug discovery    there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos  because they had their genomics data in one database in one building  and they had their protein data in another. Now  they are sticking it onto    linked data    and now they can ask the sort of question  that you probably wouldn't ask  I wouldn't ask    they would. What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons  Well  you take that mouthful and you put it into Google. Of course  there's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before. You get         hits    no results you can use. You ask the linked data    which they've now put together       hits  each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at. The power of being able to ask those questions  as a scientist    questions which actually bridge across different disciplines    is really a complete sea change. It's very very important. Scientists are totally stymied at the moment    the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems. Now if I go on like this  you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you. But  that's not true. In fact  data is about our lives. You just    you log on to your social networking site  your favorite one  you say   This is my friend.  Bing  Relationship. Data. You say   This photograph  it's about    it depicts this person.   Bing  That's data. Data  data  data. Every time you do things on the social networking site  the social networking site is taking data and using it    re purposing it    and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site. But  when you go to another linked data site    and let's say this is one about travel  and you say   I want to send this photo to all the people in that group   you can't get over the walls. The Economist wrote an article about it  and lots of people have blogged about it    tremendous frustration. The way to break down the silos is to get inter operability between social networking sites. We need to do that with linked data. One last type of data I'll talk about  maybe it's the most exciting. Before I came down here  I looked it up on OpenStreetMap The OpenStreetMap's a map  but it's also a Wiki. Zoom in and that square thing is a theater    which we're in right now    The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it. So I could go into edit mode  I could select the theater  I could add down at the bottom the name  and I could save it back. And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org  and you find this place  you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name. I did that. Me  I did that to the map. I just did that  I put that up on there. Hey  you know what  If I    that street map is all about everybody doing their bit and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs. And that is what linked data is all about. It's about people doing their bit to produce a little bit  and it all connecting. That's how linked data works. You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs. You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it. And we've practiced that. So  linked data    it's huge. I've only told you a very small number of things There are data in every aspect of our lives  every aspect of work and pleasure  and it's not just about the number of places where data comes  it's about connecting it together. And when you connect data together  you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web  with documents. You get this really huge power out of it. So  we're at the stage now where we have to do this    the people who think it's a great idea. And all the people    and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because    even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it    they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them. OK  so it's called linked data. I want you to make it. I want you to demand it. And I think it's an idea worth spreading. Thanks.\n",
      "America's favorite pie is  Audience  Apple. Kenneth Cukier  Apple. Of course it is. How do we know it  Because of data. You look at supermarket sales. You look at supermarket sales of    centimeter pies that are frozen  and apple wins  no contest. The majority of the sales are apple. But then supermarkets started selling smaller     centimeter pies  and suddenly  apple fell to fourth or fifth place. Why  What happened  Okay  think about it. When you buy a    centimeter pie  the whole family has to agree  and apple is everyone's second favorite. But when you buy an individual    centimeter pie  you can buy the one that you want. You can get your first choice. You have more data. You can see something that you couldn't see when you only had smaller amounts of it. Now  the point here is that more data doesn't just let us see more  more of the same thing we were looking at. More data allows us to see new. It allows us to see better. It allows us to see different. In this case  it allows us to see what America's favorite pie is  not apple. Now  you probably all have heard the term big data. In fact  you're probably sick of hearing the term big data. It is true that there is a lot of hype around the term  and that is very unfortunate  because big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance. In the past  we used to look at small data and think about what it would mean to try to understand the world  and now we have a lot more of it  more than we ever could before. What we find is that when we have a large body of data  we can fundamentally do things that we couldn't do when we only had smaller amounts. Big data is important  and big data is new  and when you think about it  the only way this planet is going to deal with its global challenges   to feed people  supply them with medical care  supply them with energy  electricity  and to make sure they're not burnt to a crisp because of global warming   is because of the effective use of data. So what is new about big  data  What is the big deal  Well  to answer that question  let's think about what information looked like  physically looked like in the past. In       on the island of Crete  archaeologists discovered a clay disc. They dated it from      B.C.  so it's       years old. Now  there's inscriptions on this disc  but we actually don't know what it means. It's a complete mystery  but the point is that this is what information used to look like       years ago. This is how society stored and transmitted information. Now  society hasn't advanced all that much. We still store information on discs  but now we can store a lot more information  more than ever before. Searching it is easier. Copying it easier. Sharing it is easier. Processing it is easier. And what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined when we first collected the data. In this respect  the data has gone from a stock to a flow  from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic. There is  if you will  a liquidity to information. The disc that was discovered off of Crete that's       years old  is heavy  it doesn't store a lot of information  and that information is unchangeable. By contrast  all of the files that Edward Snowden took from the National Security Agency in the United States fits on a memory stick the size of a fingernail  and it can be shared at the speed of light. More data. More. Now  one reason why we have so much data in the world today is we are collecting things that we've always collected information on  but another reason why is we're taking things that have always been informational but have never been rendered into a data format and we are putting it into data. Think  for example  the question of location. Take  for example  Martin Luther. If we wanted to know in the     s where Martin Luther was  we would have to follow him at all times  maybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell  and record it  but now think about what it looks like today. You know that somewhere  probably in a telecommunications carrier's database  there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry that records your information of where you've been at all times. If you have a cell phone  and that cell phone has GPS  but even if it doesn't have GPS  it can record your information. In this respect  location has been datafied. Now think  for example  of the issue of posture  the way that you are all sitting right now  the way that you sit  the way that you sit  the way that you sit. It's all different  and it's a function of your leg length and your back and the contours of your back  and if I were to put sensors   maybe     sensors into all of your chairs right now  I could create an index that's fairly unique to you  sort of like a fingerprint  but it's not your finger. So what could we do with this  Researchers in Tokyo are using it as a potential anti theft device in cars. The idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel  tries to stream off  but the car recognizes that a non approved driver is behind the wheel  and maybe the engine just stops  unless you type in a password into the dashboard to say   Hey  I have authorization to drive.  Great. What if every single car in Europe had this technology in it  What could we do then  Maybe  if we aggregated the data  maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict that a car accident is going to take place in the next five seconds. And then what we will have datafied is driver fatigue  and the service would be when the car senses that the person slumps into that position  automatically knows  hey  set an internal alarm that would vibrate the steering wheel  honk inside to say   Hey  wake up  pay more attention to the road.  These are the sorts of things we can do when we datafy more aspects of our lives. So what is the value of big data  Well  think about it. You have more information. You can do things that you couldn't do before. One of the most impressive areas where this concept is taking place is in the area of machine learning. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence  which itself is a branch of computer science. The general idea is that instead of instructing a computer what do do  we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself. And it will help you understand it by seeing its origins. In the     s  a computer scientist at IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers  so he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer. He played. He won. He played. He won. He played. He won  because the computer only knew what a legal move was. Arthur Samuel knew something else. Arthur Samuel knew strategy. So he wrote a small sub program alongside it operating in the background  and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every move. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer to play itself. It plays itself. It collects more data. It collects more data. It increases the accuracy of its prediction. And then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer and he plays it  and he loses  and he plays it  and he loses  and he plays it  and he loses  and Arthur Samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it. And this idea of machine learning is going everywhere. How do you think we have self driving cars  Are we any better off as a society enshrining all the rules of the road into software  No. Memory is cheaper. No. Algorithms are faster. No. Processors are better. No. All of those things matter  but that's not why. It's because we changed the nature of the problem. We changed the nature of the problem from one in which we tried to overtly and explicitly explain to the computer how to drive to one in which we say   Here's a lot of data around the vehicle. You figure it out. You figure it out that that is a traffic light  that that traffic light is red and not green  that that means that you need to stop and not go forward.  Machine learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do online  search engines  Amazon's personalization algorithm  computer translation  voice recognition systems. Researchers recently have looked at the question of biopsies  cancerous biopsies  and they've asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine whether cells are actually cancerous or not  and sure enough  when you throw the data at it  through a machine learning algorithm  the machine was able to identify the    telltale signs that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous. The problem  The medical literature only knew nine of them. Three of the traits were ones that people didn't need to look for  but that the machine spotted. Now  there are dark sides to big data as well. It will improve our lives  but there are problems that we need to be conscious of  and the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions  that the police may use big data for their purposes  a little bit like  Minority Report.  Now  it's a term called predictive policing  or algorithmic criminology  and the idea is that if we take a lot of data  for example where past crimes have been  we know where to send the patrols. That makes sense  but the problem  of course  is that it's not simply going to stop on location data  it's going to go down to the level of the individual. Why don't we use data about the person's high school transcript  Maybe we should use the fact that they're unemployed or not  their credit score  their web surfing behavior  whether they're up late at night. Their Fitbit  when it's able to identify biochemistries  will show that they have aggressive thoughts. We may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do  and we may be held accountable before we've actually acted. Privacy was the central challenge in a small data era. In the big data age  the challenge will be safeguarding free will  moral choice  human volition  human agency. There is another problem  Big data is going to steal our jobs. Big data and algorithms are going to challenge white collar  professional knowledge work in the   st century in the same way that factory automation and the assembly line challenged blue collar labor in the   th century. Think about a lab technician who is looking through a microscope at a cancer biopsy and determining whether it's cancerous or not. The person went to university. The person buys property. He or she votes. He or she is a stakeholder in society. And that person's job  as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person  is going to find that their jobs are radically changed or actually completely eliminated. Now  we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short  temporary period of dislocation  and that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live  the Industrial Revolution  because that's precisely what happened. But we forget something in that analysis  There are some categories of jobs that simply get eliminated and never come back. The Industrial Revolution wasn't very good if you were a horse. So we're going to need to be careful and take big data and adjust it for our needs  our very human needs. We have to be the master of this technology  not its servant. We are just at the outset of the big data era  and honestly  we are not very good at handling all the data that we can now collect. It's not just a problem for the National Security Agency. Businesses collect lots of data  and they misuse it too  and we need to get better at this  and this will take time. It's a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire. This is a tool  but this is a tool that  unless we're careful  will burn us. Big data is going to transform how we live  how we work and how we think. It is going to help us manage our careers and lead lives of satisfaction and hope and happiness and health  but in the past  we've often looked at information technology and our eyes have only seen the T  the technology  the hardware  because that's what was physical. We now need to recast our gaze at the I  the information  which is less apparent  but in some ways a lot more important. Humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect  as part of our timeless quest to understand the world and our place in it  and that's why big data is a big deal.\n",
      "Last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data  to put your data on the web  on the basis that if people put data onto the web    government data  scientific data  community data  whatever it is    it will be used by other people to do wonderful things  in ways that they never could have imagined. So  today I'm back just to show you a few things  to show you  in fact  there is an open data movement afoot  now  around the world. The cry of  Raw data now   which I made people make in the auditorium  was heard around the world. So  let's roll the video. A classic story  the first one which lots of people picked up  was when in March    on March   th in fact  soon after TED    Paul Clarke  in the U.K. government  blogged   Oh  I've just got some raw data. Here it is  it's about bicycle accidents.  Two days it took the Times Online to make a map  a mashable map    we call these things mash ups    a mashed up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected. Here's more data  traffic survey data  again  put out by the U.K. government  and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards  then a user could just make a map  just by clicking. Does this data affect things  Well  let's get back to     . Look at Zanesville  Ohio. Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant  and which houses are there  which houses have been connected to the water. And he got  from other data sources  information to show which houses are occupied by white people. Well  there was too much of a correlation  he felt  between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water  and the judge was not impressed either. The judge was not impressed to the tune of   .  million dollars. That's the power of taking one piece of data  another piece of data  putting it together  and showing the result. Let's look at some data from the U.K. now. This is U.K. government data  a completely independent site  Where Does My Money Go. It allows anybody to go there and burrow down. You can burrow down by a particular type of spending  or you can go through all the different regions and compare them. So  that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data. Yes  certainly you can do it over here. Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California. Take an arbitrary example  Long Beach  California  you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending on different things such as energy. In fact  this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data.gov  and data.gov.uk. And I'm delighted to see a great competition between the U.K. in blue  and the U.S. in red. How can you use this stuff  Well  for example  if you have lots of data about places you can take  from a postcode    which is like a zip plus four    for a specific group of houses  you can make paper  print off a paper which has got very  very specific things about the bus stops  the things specifically near you. On a larger scale  this is a mash up of the data which was released about the Afghan elections. It allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at. The red circles are polling stations  selected by your criteria. And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors  like the threat level. So  that was government data. I also talked about community generated data    in fact I edited some. This is the wiki map  this is the Open Street Map.  Terrace Theater  I actually put on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year. I was not the only person editing the open street map. Each flash on this visualization    put together by ITO World    shows an edit in      made to the Open Street Map. Let's now spin the world during the same year. Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere looking at the Open Street Map  and realizing it could be better. You can see Europe is ablaze with updates. Some places  perhaps not as much as they should be. Here focusing in on Haiti. The map of Port au Prince at the end of      was not all it could be  not as good as the map of California. Fortunately  just after the earthquake  GeoEye  a commercial company  released satellite imagery with a license  which allowed the open source community to use it. This is January  in time lapse  of people editing ... that's the earthquake. After the earthquake  immediately  people all over the world  mappers who wanted to help  and could  looked at that imagery  built the map  quickly building it up. We're focusing now on Port au Prince. The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the  satellite images . So  now we have  immediately  a real time map showing where there are refugee camps    rapidly became the best map to use if you're doing relief work in Port au Prince. Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device being used by rescue team in Haiti. There's the map showing  on the left hand side  that hospital    actually that's a hospital ship. This is a real time map that shows blocked roads  damaged buildings  refugee camps    it shows things that are needed  for rescue and relief work . So  if you've been involved in that at all  I just wanted to say  Whatever you've been doing  whether you've just been chanting   Raw data now   or you've been putting government or scientific data online  I just wanted to take this opportunity to say  Thank you very much  and we have only just started \n",
      "Six thousand miles of road      miles of subway track      miles of bike lanes and a half a mile of tram track  if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island. These are the numbers that make up the infrastructure of New York City. These are the statistics of our infrastructure. They're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies. For example  the Department of Transportation will probably tell you how many miles of road they maintain. The MTA will boast how many miles of subway track there are. Most city agencies give us statistics. This is from a report this year from the Taxi and Limousine Commission  where we learn that there's about        taxis here in New York City. Pretty interesting  right  But did you ever think about where these numbers came from  Because for these numbers to exist  someone at the city agency had to stop and say  hmm  here's a number that somebody might want want to know. Here's a number  that our citizens want to know. So they go back to their raw data  they count  they add  they calculate  and then they put out reports  and those reports will have numbers like this. The problem is  how do they know all of our questions  We have lots of questions. In fact  in some ways there's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city. The agencies can never keep up. So the paradigm isn't exactly working  and I think our policymakers realize that  because in       Mayor Bloomberg signed into law what he called the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country. In a lot of ways  he's right. In the last two years   the city has released       datasets on our open data portal  and it's pretty awesome. So you go and look at data like this  and instead of just counting the number of cabs  we can start to ask different questions. So I had a question. When's rush hour in New York City  It can be pretty bothersome. When is rush hour exactly  And I thought to myself  these cabs aren't just numbers  these are GPS recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every ride they take. There's data there  and I looked at that data  and I made a plot of the average speed of taxis in New York City throughout the day. You can see that from about midnight to around      in the morning  speed increases  and at that point  things turn around  and they get slower and slower and slower until about      in the morning  when they end up at around    and a half miles per hour. The average taxi is going    and a half miles per hour on our city streets  and it turns out it stays that way for the entire day. So I said to myself  I guess there's no rush hour in New York City. There's just a rush day. Makes sense. And this is important for a couple of reasons. If you're a transportation planner  this might be pretty interesting to know. But if you want to get somewhere quickly  you now know to set your alarm for      in the morning and you're all set. New York  right  But there's a story behind this data. This data wasn't just available  it turns out. It actually came from something called a Freedom of Information Law Request  or a FOIL Request. This is a form you can find on the Taxi and Limousine Commission website. In order to access this data  you need to go get this form  fill it out  and they will notify you  and a guy named Chris Whong did exactly that. Chris went down  and they told him   Just bring a brand new hard drive  down to our office  leave it here for five hours  we'll copy the data and you take it back.  And that's where this data came from. Now  Chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public  and so it ended up online for all to use  and that's where this graph came from. And the fact that it exists is amazing. These GPS recorders    really cool. But the fact that we have citizens walking around with hard drives picking up data from city agencies to make it public    it was already kind of public  you could get to it  but it was  public   it wasn't public. And we can do better than that as a city. We don't need our citizens walking around with hard drives. Now  not every dataset is behind a FOIL Request. Here is a map I made with the most dangerous intersections in New York City based on cyclist accidents. So the red areas are more dangerous. And what it shows is first the East side of Manhattan  especially in the lower area of Manhattan  has more cyclist accidents. That might make sense because there are more cyclists coming off the bridges there. But there's other hotspots worth studying. There's Williamsburg. There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens. And this is exactly the kind of data we need for Vision Zero. This is exactly what we're looking for. But there's a story behind this data as well. This data didn't just appear. How many of you guys know this logo  Yeah  I see some shakes. Have you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a PDF and make sense of it  I see more shakes. More of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo. I like that. So what happened is  the data that you just saw was actually on a PDF. In fact  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of PDF put out by our very own NYPD  and in order to access it  you would either have to copy and paste for hundreds and hundreds of hours  or you could be John Krauss. John Krauss was like  I'm not going to copy and paste this data. I'm going to write a program. It's called the NYPD Crash Data Band Aid  and it goes to the NYPD's website and it would download PDFs. Every day it would search  if it found a PDF  it would download it and then it would run some PDF scraping program  and out would come the text  and it would go on the Internet  and then people could make maps like that. And the fact that the data's here  the fact that we have access to it    Every accident  by the way  is a row in this table. You can imagine how many PDFs that is. The fact that we have access to that is great  but let's not release it in PDF form  because then we're having our citizens write PDF scrapers. It's not the best use of our citizens' time  and we as a city can do better than that. Now  the good news is that the de Blasio administration actually recently released this data a few months ago  and so now we can actually have access to it  but there's a lot of data still entombed in PDF. For example  our crime data is still only available in PDF. And not just our crime data  our own city budget. Our city budget is only readable right now in PDF form. And it's not just us that can't analyze it    our own legislators who vote for the budget also only get it in PDF. So our legislators cannot analyze  the budget that they are voting for. And I think as a city we can do a little better than that as well. Now  there's a lot of data that's not hidden in PDFs. This is an example of a map I made  and this is the dirtiest waterways in New York City. Now  how do I measure dirty  Well  it's kind of a little weird  but I looked at the level of fecal coliform  which is a measurement of fecal matter in each of our waterways. The larger the circle  the dirtier the water  so the large circles are dirty water  the small circles are cleaner. What you see is inland waterways. This is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years. And inland waterways are  in general  dirtier. That makes sense  right  And the bigger circles are dirty. And I learned a few things from this. Number one  Never swim in anything that ends in  creek  or  canal.  But number two  I also found the dirtiest waterway in New York City  by this measure  one measure. In Coney Island Creek  which is not the Coney Island you swim in  luckily. It's on the other side. But Coney Island Creek     percent of samples taken over the last five years have had fecal levels so high that it would be against state law to swim in the water. And this is not the kind of fact that you're going to see boasted in a city report  right  It's not going to be  the front page on nyc.gov. You're not going to see it there  but the fact that we can get  to that data is awesome. But once again  it wasn't super easy  because this data was not on the open data portal. If you were to go to the open data portal  you'd see just a snippet of it   a year or a few months. It was actually on the Department of Environmental Protection's website. And each one of these links is an Excel  sheet  and each Excel sheet is different. Every heading is different  you copy  paste  reorganize. When you do you can make maps and that's great  but once again  we can do better than that  as a city  we can normalize things. And we're getting there  because there's this website that Socrata makes called the Open Data Portal NYC. This is where       data sets  that don't suffer from the things I just told you live  and that number is growing  and that's great. You can download data in any format  be it CSV or PDF or Excel document. Whatever you want  you can download the data that way. The problem is  once you do  you will find that each agency codes their addresses differently. So one is street name   intersection street  street  borough  address  building  building address. So once again  you're spending time  even when we have this portal  you're spending time normalizing our address fields. And that's not the best use  of our citizens' time. We can do better than that as a city. We can standardize our addresses  and if we do   we can get more maps like this. This is a map of fire hydrants in New York City  but not just any fire hydrants. These are the top     grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets. So I learned a few things from this map  and I really like this map. Number one  just don't park on the Upper East Side. Just don't. It doesn't matter where you park  you will get a hydrant ticket. Number two  I found the two highest grossing hydrants in all of New York City  and they're on the Lower East Side  and they were bringing in over        dollars a year in parking tickets. And that seemed a little strange to me when I noticed it  so I did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant and then something called a curb extension  which is like a seven foot space to walk on  and then a parking spot. And so these cars came along  and the hydrant     It's all the way over there  I'm fine   and there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them. They would park there  and the NYPD disagreed with this designation and would ticket them. And it wasn't just me  who found a parking ticket. This is the Google  Street View car driving by finding the same parking ticket. So I wrote about this on my blog  on I Quant NY  and the DOT responded  and they said   While the DOT has not received any complaints about this location  we will review the roadway markings and make any appropriate alterations.  And I thought to myself  typical government response  all right  moved on with my life. But then  a few weeks later  something incredible happened. They repainted the spot  and for a second I thought I saw the future of open data  because think about what happened here. For five years  this spot was being  ticketed  and it was confusing  and then a citizen found something  they told the city  and within a few weeks the problem was fixed. It's amazing. And a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog. It's not  it's about being a partner. We can empower our citizens to be better partners for government  and it's not that hard. All we need are a few changes. If you're FOILing data  if you're seeing your data  being FOILed over and over again  let's release it to the public  that's a sign that it should be made public. And if you're a government agency releasing a PDF  let's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data  because that data is coming from somewhere. I don't know where  but it's coming from somewhere  and you can release it with the PDF. And let's adopt and share some open data standards. Let's start with our addresses here in New York City. Let's just start normalizing our addresses. Because New York is a leader in open data. Despite all this  we are absolutely a leader in open data  and if we start normalizing things  and set an open data standard  others will follow. The state will follow  and maybe the federal government  Other countries could follow  and we're not that far off from a time where you could write one program and map information from     countries. It's not science fiction. We're actually quite close. And by the way  who are we empowering with this  Because it's not just John Krauss and it's not just Chris Whong. There are hundreds of meetups going on in New York City right now  active meetups. There are thousands of people attending these meetups. These people are going after work and on weekends  and they're attending these meetups to look at open data and make our city a better place. Groups like BetaNYC  who just last week  released something called citygram.nyc that allows you to subscribe to     complaints around your own home  or around your office. You put in your address  you get local complaints. And it's not just the tech community that are after these things. It's urban planners like  the students I teach at Pratt. It's policy advocates  it's everyone  it's citizens from a diverse set of backgrounds. And with some small  incremental changes  we can unlock the passion and the ability of our citizens to harness open data and make our city even better  whether it's one dataset  or one parking spot at a time. Thank you.\n",
      "Motor racing is a funny old business. We make a new car every year  and then we spend the rest of the season trying to understand what it is we've built to make it better  to make it faster. And then the next year  we start again. Now  the car you see in front of you is quite complicated. The chassis is made up of about        components  the engine another        the electronics about eight and a half thousand. So there's about        things there that can go wrong. So motor racing is very much about attention to detail. The other thing about Formula   in particular is we're always changing the car. We're always trying to make it faster. So every two weeks  we will be making about       new components to fit to the car. Five to    percent of the race car will be different every two weeks of the year. So how do we do that  Well  we start our life with the racing car. We have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things. On the race car in front of you here there are about     sensors when it goes into a race. It's measuring all sorts of things around the car. That data is logged. We're logging about     different parameters within the data systems  about        health parameters and events to say when things are not working the way they should do  and we're sending that data back to the garage using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second. So during a two hour race  each car will be sending     million numbers. That's twice as many numbers as words that each of us speaks in a lifetime. It's a huge amount of data. But it's not enough just to have data and measure it. You need to be able to do something with it. So we've spent a lot of time and effort in turning the data into stories to be able to tell  what's the state of the engine  how are the tires degrading  what's the situation with fuel consumption  So all of this is taking data and turning it into knowledge that we can act upon. Okay  so let's have a look at a little bit of data. Let's pick a bit of data from another three month old patient. This is a child  and what you're seeing here is real data  and on the far right hand side  where everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic  that is the patient going into cardiac arrest. It was deemed to be an unpredictable event. This was a heart attack that no one could see coming. But when we look at the information there  we can see that things are starting to become a little fuzzy about five minutes or so before the cardiac arrest. We can see small changes in things like the heart rate moving. These were all undetected by normal thresholds which would be applied to data. So the question is  why couldn't we see it  Was this a predictable event  Can we look more at the patterns in the data to be able to do things better  So this is a child  about the same age as the racing car on stage  three months old. It's a patient with a heart problem. Now  when you look at some of the data on the screen above  things like heart rate  pulse  oxygen  respiration rates  they're all unusual for a normal child  but they're quite normal for the child there  and so one of the challenges you have in health care is  how can I look at the patient in front of me  have something which is specific for her  and be able to detect when things start to change  when things start to deteriorate  Because like a racing car  any patient  when things start to go bad  you have a short time to make a difference. So what we did is we took a data system which we run every two weeks of the year in Formula   and we installed it on the hospital computers at Birmingham Children's Hospital. We streamed data from the bedside instruments in their pediatric intensive care so that we could both look at the data in real time and  more importantly  to store the data so that we could start to learn from it. And then  we applied an application on top which would allow us to tease out the patterns in the data in real time so we could see what was happening  so we could determine when things started to change. Now  in motor racing  we're all a little bit ambitious  audacious  a little bit arrogant sometimes  so we decided we would also look at the children as they were being transported to intensive care. Why should we wait until they arrived in the hospital before we started to look  And so we installed a real time link between the ambulance and the hospital  just using normal  G telephony to send that data so that the ambulance became an extra bed in intensive care. And then we started looking at the data. So the wiggly lines at the top  all the colors  this is the normal sort of data you would see on a monitor    heart rate  pulse  oxygen within the blood  and respiration. The lines on the bottom  the blue and the red  these are the interesting ones. The red line is showing an automated version of the early warning score that Birmingham Children's Hospital were already running. They'd been running that since       and already have stopped cardiac arrests and distress within the hospital. The blue line is an indication of when patterns start to change  and immediately  before we even started putting in clinical interpretation  we can see that the data is speaking to us. It's telling us that something is going wrong. The plot with the red and the green blobs  this is plotting different components of the data against each other. The green is us learning what is normal for that child. We call it the cloud of normality. And when things start to change  when conditions start to deteriorate  we move into the red line. There's no rocket science here. It is displaying data that exists already in a different way  to amplify it  to provide cues to the doctors  to the nurses  so they can see what's happening. In the same way that a good racing driver relies on cues to decide when to apply the brakes  when to turn into a corner  we need to help our physicians and our nurses to see when things are starting to go wrong. So we have a very ambitious program. We think that the race is on to do something differently. We are thinking big. It's the right thing to do. We have an approach which  if it's successful  there's no reason why it should stay within a hospital. It can go beyond the walls. With wireless connectivity these days  there is no reason why patients  doctors and nurses always have to be in the same place at the same time. And meanwhile  we'll take our little three month old baby  keep taking it to the track  keeping it safe  and making it faster and better. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Design is a slippery and elusive phenomenon  which has meant different things at different times. But all truly inspiring design projects have one thing in common  they began with a dream. And the bolder the dream  the greater the design feat that will be required to achieve it. And this is why the greatest designers are almost always the biggest dreamers and rebels and renegades. This has been the case throughout history  all the way back to the year     BC  when a    year old became the king of a remote  very poor and very small Asian country. He dreamt of acquiring land  riches and power through military conquest. And his design skills    improbable though it sounds    would be essential in enabling him to do so. At the time  all weapons were made by hand to different specifications. So if an archer ran out of arrows during a battle  they wouldn't necessarily be able to fire another archer's arrows from their bow. This of course meant that they would be less effective in combat and very vulnerable  too. Ying solved this problem by insisting that all bows and arrows were designed identically  so they were interchangeable. And he did the same for daggers  axes  spears  shields and every other form of weaponry. His formidably equipped army won batter after battle  and within    years  his tiny kingdom had succeeded in conquering all its larger  richer  more powerful neighbors  to found the mighty Chinese Empire. Now  no one  of course  would have thought of describing Ying Zheng as a designer at the time    why would they  And yet he used design unknowingly and instinctively but with tremendous ingenuity to achieve his ends. And so did another equally improbable  accidental designer  who was also not above using violence to get what he wanted. This was Edward Teach  better known as the British pirate  Blackbeard. This was the golden age of piracy  where pirates like Teach were terrorizing the high seas. Colonial trade was flourishing  and piracy was highly profitable. And the smarter pirates like him realized that to maximize their spoils  they needed to attack their enemies so brutally that they would surrender on sight. So in other words  they could take the ships without wasting ammunition  or incurring casualties. So Edward Teach redesigned himself as Blackbeard by playing the part of a merciless brute. He wore heavy jackets and big hats to accentuate his height. He grew the bushy black beard that obscured his face. He slung braces of pistols on either shoulder. He even attached matches to the brim of his hat and set them alight  so they sizzled menacingly whenever his ship was poised to attack. And like many pirates of that era  he flew a flag that bore the macabre symbols of a human skull and a pair of crossed bones  because those motifs had signified death in so many cultures for centuries  that their meaning was instantly recognizable  even in the lawless  illiterate world of the high seas  surrender or you'll suffer. So of course  all his sensible victims surrendered on sight. Put like that  it's easy to see why Edward Teach and his fellow pirates could be seen as pioneers of modern communications design  and why their deadly symbol    there's more    why their deadly symbol of the skull and crossbones was a precursor of today's logos  rather like the big red letters standing behind me  but of course with a different message. Yet design was also used to nobler ends by an equally brilliant and equally improbable designer  the   th century British nurse  Florence Nightingale. Her mission was to provide decent healthcare for everyone. Nightingale was born into a rather grand  very wealthy British family  who were horrified when she volunteered to work in military hospitals during the Crimean War. Once there  she swiftly realized that more patients were dying of infections that they caught there  in the filthy  fetid wards  than they were of battle wounds. So she campaigned for cleaner  lighter  airier clinics to be designed and built. Back in Britain  she mounted another campaign  this time for civilian hospitals  and insisted that the same design principles were applied to them. The Nightingale ward  as it is called  dominated hospital design for decades to come  and elements of it are still used today. But by then  design was seen as a tool of the Industrial Age. It was formalized and professionalized  but it was restricted to specific roles and generally applied in pursuit of commercial goals rather than being used intuitively  as Florence Nightingale  Blackbeard and Ying Zheng had done. By the   th century  this commercial ethos was so powerful  that any designers who deviated from it risked being seen as cranks or subversives. Now among them is one of my great design heroes  the brilliant L szl  Moholy Nagy. He was the Hungarian artist and designer whose experiments with the impact of technology on daily life were so powerful that they still influence the design of the digital images we see on our phone and computer screens. He radicalized the Bauhaus Design School in     s Germany  and yet some of his former colleagues shunned him when he struggled to open a new Bauhaus in Chicago years later. Moholy's ideas were as bold and incisive as ever  but his approach to design was too experimental  as was his insistence on seeing it  as he put it  as an attitude  not a profession to be in tune with the times. And sadly  the same applied to another design maverick  Richard Buckminster Fuller. He was yet another brilliant design visionary and design activist  who was completely committed to designing a sustainable society in such a forward thinking way that he started talking about the importance of environmentalism in design in the     s. Now he  despite his efforts  was routinely mocked as a crank by many in the design establishment  and admittedly  some of his experiments failed  like the flying car that never got off the ground. And yet  the geodesic dome  his design formula to build an emergency shelter from scraps of wood  metal  plastic  bits of tree  old blankets  plastic sheeting    just about anything that's available at the time    is one of the greatest feats of humanitarian design  and has provided sorely needed refuge to many  many people in desperate circumstances ever since. Now  it was the courage and verve of radical designers like Bucky and Moholy that drew me to design. I began my career as a news journalist and foreign correspondent. I write about politics  economics and corporate affairs  and I could have chosen to specialize in any of those fields. But I picked design  because I believe it's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal to improve our quality of life. Thank you  fellow TED design buffs. And greatly as I admire the achievements of professional designers  which have been extraordinary and immense  I also believe that design benefits hugely from the originality  the lateral thinking and the resourcefulness of its rebels and renegades. And we're living at a remarkable moment in design  because this is a time when the two camps are coming closer together. Because even very basic advances in digital technology have enabled them to operate increasingly independently  in or out of a commercial context  to pursue ever more ambitious and eclectic objectives. So in theory  basic platforms like crowdfunding  cloud computing  social media are giving greater freedom to professional designers and giving more resources for the improvisational ones  and hopefully  a more receptive response to their ideas. Now  some of my favorite examples of this are in Africa  where a new generation of designers are developing incredible Internet of Things technologies to fulfill Florence Nightingale's dream of improving healthcare in countries where more people now have access to cell phones than to clean  running water. And among them is Arthur Zang. He's a young  Cameroonian design engineer who has a adapted a tablet computer into the Cardiopad  a mobile heart monitoring device. It can be used to monitor the hearts of patients in remote  rural areas. The data is then sent on a cellular network to well equipped hospitals hundreds of miles away for analysis. And if any problems are spotted by the specialists there  a suitable course of treatment is recommended. And this of course saves many patients from making long  arduous  expensive and often pointless journeys to those hospitals  and makes it much  much likelier that their hearts will actually be checked. Arthur Zang started working on the Cardiopad eight years ago  in his final year at university. But he failed to persuade any conventional sources to give him investment to get the project off the ground. He posted the idea on Facebook  where a Cameroonian government official saw it and managed to secure a government grant for him. He's now developing not only the Cardiopad  but other mobile medical devices to treat different conditions. And he isn't alone  because there are many other inspiring and enterprising designers who are also pursuing extraordinary projects of their own. And I'm going to finish by looking at just a few of them. One is Peek Vision. This is a group of doctors and designers in Kenya  who've developed an Internet of Things technology of their own  as a portable eye examination kit. Then there's Gabriel Maher  who is developing a new design language to enable us to articulate the subtleties of our changing gender identities  without recourse to traditional stereotypes. All of these designers and many more are pursuing their dreams  by the making the most of their newfound freedom  with the discipline of professional designers and the resourcefulness of rebels and renegades. And we all stand to benefit. Thank you.\n",
      "Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be. And in my idea  heaven is satisfied curiosity. I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where I can just lie down with my belly down  like I was watching TV when I was a child  and my elbows up. And I can basically look everywhere I want  see every movie I've always wanted to see. And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in New York when you're reading  there's something really soothing and easy. Well  the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life  in a way  because I discovered ... it took me a while to understand it  but when I discovered around    years of age that I was much more comfortable with objects than with people  I finally decided to really embrace this passion. And I basically live my life in sort of a trance  and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story. Just to give you an example  this is the exhibition  Humble Masterpieces  as it was at MoMA in     . We were in Queens  we were building the big  big  big  big building in Midtown  so we were in the small  small  small boondocks. That was one of the funnest moments of my career. But it's not only that. The typeface    the typeface is Helvetica  it's its   th anniversary this year. And so I start thinking    Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together  trying to outdo Akzidenz Grotesk  and come up with a new sans serif typeface    and the movie starts playing in my head already. And of course  you can imagine  with Humble Masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred. And I do hope  by the way  that the real goal of the exhibition is going to have the same effect on you. The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ... you know when they do homeworks at home  Instead of having a tray with two peas  I was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag and do their museum quality design collection on a tray. So  everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces  and at MoMA we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces. And when you do that  usually you get    percent porn and    percent real suggestions  and instead it was all    almost    all good suggestions. And a lot of nationalism came in. For instance  I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop  but they were very proud so every Spaniard said  la frego.  And Italians did the pizza. And I wanted to show you  also  the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good    they had moonshine  laundry detergents and liquid nails. And I keep it going  and I just got  also  this suggestion from Milan  it's our traffic divider  which we call  panettone   and it's painted  it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan to define all the lanes of traffic. So  think of your own  send them on if you want to    they're always welcome. But an exhibition like that made me understand even more what I've been thinking of for    years ever since I got to MoMA. I'm Italian. In Italy  design is normal. Different parts of the world have a knack for different things. I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay  and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism that you don't see elsewhere  but the contemporary art was terrible. In Italy  in Milan especially  contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place. But design    oh  my God. What you find at the store at the corner  without going to any kind of fancy store  is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated. It's just what you find at the store. And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art. I'm always amazed    three year olds know who Richard Serra is and take you to the galleries. But design  for some reason  is still misunderstood for decoration. It's really interesting  what many people think when I say the word  design  is they think of this kind of overdesigned    in this case  it's overdesigned on purpose  but    decoration  interior decoration. They think of somebody choosing fabrics. Design can be that  of course  but it can also be this. It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people  because  as you know  Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies. So  what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline  so that instead of being completely strangled  a teenager can also sip a Coke. They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important. And then they make a little tent for the baby. However cruel  however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design  and it is miles away from the fancy furniture  but still  it's part of my same field of passion. What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to harness the power of MoMA because it's great to work there. You really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions  and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors. I'm very well aware that    percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse  and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there. But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in       which is to try and see what's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better. There have been many episodes  and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience  but in two instances  his great grandfather  grandfather    I'm always a little perplexed about the relation  exactly    Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time were involved in two competitions  one in       it was about organic furniture  and the second one in      was low cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture. And then there was good design for very low price. There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life. So  I started out in '   with this exhibition that was called Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design. It was about a new phase  in my opinion  in the world of design in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves. And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California  at that time  they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market. And at the same time  the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro  who did these beautiful salt and pepper containers that are made of rice dough. So you see  the range is really quite diverse. And then  for instance  this other exhibition that was entitled Workspheres in       where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time. And you see IDEO there. It was beautiful    it was called Personal Skies. The idea was that if you had a cubicle  you could project a sky on top of your head and have your own  Cielo in Una Stanza     a sky in a room    it's a very famous Italian song. And other examples  this was Marti Guixe about working on the go  and Hella Jongerius  my favorite  about how to work at home. And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design  designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world. What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs  current conditions in economy  in materials  in sustainability issues  and then what they do at the end    if they are good    is much more than the sum of its parts. Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious. The idea behind her work was that at that time  everybody was saying you have to really divide your life. Instead  she said   No  no. Work and leisure can be together.  Yeah  that's particularly gorgeous    it's the TV dinner of     . There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime  but I don't want to focus on my shows. I would like  instead  to talk about how great some designers are. I've always had a hard time with the word  maverick.  I came to the United States    years ago  and to this day I have to ask   What does that mean   So  this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle. Therefore  he was not following everybody's lead  and therefore  he was a maverick. So  designers do need to be mavericks  because the best way to design a successful object    and also an object that we were missing before    is to pretend that either it never existed or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it. So  Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA and it ended at the beginning of last year. It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection. It's a long story because it started before      and it was called Emergency. And then when      happened  I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition until  slowly but surely  it came back    as a half full glass instead of half empty    and it was about protection and safety. But it ranged from such items as a complete de mining equipment to these kind of water sterilizing straws  so it was really wide ranging. It also had ... you know  Cameron and I worked a little bit together  and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition. But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore  design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point. It's a sense of economy and a sense  also  of humor. This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland  who's South African. It's a suit for civil disobedience. The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest and the police comes towards you  you're wearing this thing    it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified    and the police is reminded  it's like having a flower in front of the rifle. And also  you can imagine  a whole group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police. So  designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional  but they're functional to our understanding of issues. Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia  like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away  or even better  the huggable atomic mushroom  which got me an article on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States    I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA  or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations. But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self  and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic. This is Cindy van den Bremen  who is a Dutch designer that's done this series of Capsters. They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski  play tennis  do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves. And sometimes by doing this kind of research  you encounter such beautiful ideas of design. Twan Verdonck is really young  I think he's     and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments. They're quite beautiful. They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you    because autistic children like to be hugged tight  so it has a spring inside    all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self. Design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges. I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul. And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury  and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality. And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury  and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much. I want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy    very  very clear limits. This is Cuba  and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell  and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks. So they're quite beautiful  but they're beautiful because they're so smart and economical. And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo  Fernando and Humberto Campana  who got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money. But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself. So really  design takes everything into account  and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances  as we become more and more wireless and impalpable  designers  instead  want us to be hands on. Sometimes hammer on. This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically. Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint  all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona. From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples to these intra toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes. It's quite beautiful because somehow  this is a gorgeous moment for design. Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna  whose name was Marchetti  explain how the innovation in the military industry    therefore  secret innovation    and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed. And that makes sense. In moments of war there's great technological innovation  and in the world you have to do without    well  during the Second World War  you had to do without steel  you had to do without aluminum. And then as peace comes  all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian market. Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance  fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden. I think that this is a strange moment. The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously  just like the rhythm of our life in the past    years  so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is. But it surely is a very important moment for design  because not only is the technology proceeding  not only is computing technology making open source possible also in the world of design  but also the idea of sustainability    which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO  emissions and footprint  but also sustainability of human interrelationships    is very much part of the work of so many designers. And that's why designers  more and more  are working on behaviors rather than on objects. Especially the good ones  not all of them. I wanted to show you  for instance  the work of Mathieu Lehanneur  which is quite fantastic. He's another young designer from France who's working    and at this point he's working  also  with pharmaceutical companies    on new ways to engage patients  especially children  in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty. For instance  this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine  so the child has to go    pffff     to release and relieve the container itself. And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin  so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind of delivery. Similarly  there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste  orally. The next show that I'm going to work on    and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here    is about the relationship between design and science. I'm trying to find not the metaphors  but  rather  the points in common    the common gripes  the common issues  the common preoccupations    and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instruction  as a direction rather than a prescription of form. And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this. I've sent an email already to quite a few of you. But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales  and therefore  really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful. Thank you.  Applause \n",
      "I'd like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking. Now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project I was ever hired to do  something like    years ago. It's a woodworking machine  or at least a piece of one  and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern  a little bit easier to use. I thought  at the time  I did a pretty good job. Unfortunately  not very long afterwards the company went out of business. This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine. I put an attractive shell around some new technology. Again     months later  the product was obsolete. And now  of course  the whole technology is obsolete. Now  I'm a fairly slow learner  but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn't all that important    making things more attractive  making them a bit easier to use  making them more marketable. By focusing on a design  maybe just a single product  I was being incremental and not having much of an impact. But I think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon  and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the   th century as design became a tool of consumerism. So when we talk about design today  and particularly when we read about it in the popular press  we're often talking about products like these. Amusing  Yes. Desirable  Maybe. Important  Not so very. But this wasn't always the way. And I'd like to suggest that if we take a different view of design  and focus less on the object and more on design thinking as an approach  that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact. Now this gentleman  Isambard Kingdom Brunel  designed many great things in his career in the   th century  including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe. Both great designs and actually very innovative too. His greatest creation runs actually right through here in Oxford. It's called the Great Western Railway. And as a kid I grew up very close to here  and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past. You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting   Rain  Steam and Speed . Now  what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside. Now  this was back in the   th century. And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made  which meant building long viaducts across river valleys    this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead    and long tunnels such as the one at Box  in Wiltshire. But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey. He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in London and disembark from a ship in New York. One journey from London to New York. This is the S.S. Great Western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey. Now  Brunel was working     years before the emergence of the design profession  but I think he was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world changing innovations. Now  design thinking begins with what Roger Martin  the business school professor at the University of Toronto  calls integrative thinking. And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions. In the case of design  that means balancing desirability  what humans need  with technical feasibility  and economic viability. With innovations like the Great Western  we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit. So somehow  we went from this to this. Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world  to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things. As our industrial society matured  so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics  image and fashion. Now I'm not trying to throw stones here. I'm a fully paid up member of that priesthood  and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses. There we go. But I do think that perhaps design is getting big again. And that's happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems    to global warming  to education  healthcare  security  clean water  whatever. And as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems  there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful. And I'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes. The first of those is that design is human centered. It may integrate technology and economics  but it starts with what humans need  or might need. What makes life easier  more enjoyable  What makes technology useful and usable  But that is more than simply good ergonomics  putting the buttons in the right place. It's often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas. So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India  they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening their parents. Conversion Sound has developed a high quality  ultra low cost digital hearing aid for the developing world. Now  in the West we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids. In places like India  those technicians simply don't exist. So it took a team working in India with patients and community health workers to understand how a PDA and an application on a PDA might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service. Instead of starting with technology  the team started with people and culture. So if human need is the place to start  then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making. Instead of thinking about what to build  building in order to think. Now  prototypes speed up the process of innovation  because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses. And the faster we do that  the faster our ideas evolve. Now  much has been said and written about the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai  India. They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay to cross subsidize those who cannot. Now  they are very efficient  but they are also very innovative. When I visited them a few years ago  what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early. This is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs. They make their own intraocular lenses. These are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts. And I think it's partly their prototyping mentality that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough. Because they brought the cost down from      a pair  down to just    a pair. Partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory  they used the basement of one of their hospitals. And instead of installing the large scale machines used by western producers  they used low cost CAD CAM prototyping technology. They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world and have recently moved into a custom factory. So if human need is the place to start  and prototyping  a vehicle for progress  then there are also some questions to ask about the destination. Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption  design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation    the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful  productive and profitable. So I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about  this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things  and take that a little bit further and say that I think the design of participatory systems  in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured  is going to be the major theme  not only for design  but also for our economy as we go forward. So William Beveridge  when he wrote the first of his famous reports in       created what became Britain's welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well being. By the time he wrote his third report  he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare consumers. Hilary Cottam  Charlie Leadbeater  and Hugo Manassei of Participle have taken this idea of participation  and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge  .   they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state. So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle  they worked with residents in Southwark  South London and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks. Designs were refined and developed with     older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year. We can take this idea of participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it's taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone. Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system Kaiser Permanente study the topic of improving the patient experience  and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge and change shift. Through a program of observational research  brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping  they've developed a completely new way to change shift. They went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients  to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients  using a simple software tool. By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients down from    minutes to    minutes  on average. They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness. When you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in    hospitals in the system  it resulted  actually  in a pretty big impact. And this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone. So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they're being applied to. But I'd like to go back to Brunel here  and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now  and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool. And that connection is change. In times of change we need new alternatives  new ideas. Now  Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution  when all of life and our economy was being reinvented. Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course  and indeed they are part of the problem today. But  again  we are in the midst of massive change. And that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society    how we keep ourselves healthy  how we govern ourselves  how we educate ourselves  how we keep ourselves secure. And in these times of change  we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete. So why design thinking  Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems. Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach where we make the best choice out of available alternatives  it encourages us to take a divergent approach  to explore new alternatives  new solutions  new ideas that have not existed before. But before we go through that process of divergence  there is actually quite an important first step. And that is  what is the question that we're trying to answer  What's the design brief  Now Brunel may have asked a question like this   How do I take a train from London to New York   But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today  So these are some that we've been asked to think about recently. And one in particular  is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund  in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. How might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people  and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers  So instead of having a bunch of American designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate  we took a sort of more open  collaborative and participative approach. We teamed designers and investment experts up with    water organizations across India. And through workshops they developed innovative new products  services  and business models. We hosted a competition and then funded five of those organizations to develop their ideas. So they developed and iterated these ideas. And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns  community outreach strategies  business models  new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water. Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market. And the same process is just getting underway with NGOs in East Africa. So for me  this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that I was working on at the beginning of my career. That by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly  by getting the process out of the hands of designers  and by getting the active participation of the community  we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions. And just like Brunel  by focusing on systems  we can have a bigger impact. So that's one thing that we've been working on. I'm actually really quite interested  and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on. What kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle  And if you've got any ideas then feel free  you can post them to Twitter. There is a hash tag there that you can use   CBDQ. And the list looked something like this a little while ago. And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in by using the same hash code. So I'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference  that it can help create new ideas and new innovations  beyond the latest High Street products. To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design  more like Brunel  less a domain of a professional priesthood. And the first step is to start asking the right questions. Thank you very much.\n",
      "I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design  I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art. But what we're going to talk about today is really design. Really good designers are like sponges  they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way  and transform it so that it can be used by people like us. And so that gives me an opportunity  because every design show that I curate kind of looks at a different world. And it's great  because it seems like every time I change jobs. And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that I'm working on  which is called  Design and the Elastic Mind.  The world that I decided to focus on this particular time is the world of science and the world of technology. Technology always comes into play when design is involved  but science does a little less. But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them. And this is what this exhibition looks at. If you think about your life today  you go every day through many different scales  many different changes of rhythm and pace. You work over different time zones  you talk to very different people  you multitask. We all know it  and we do it kind of automatically. Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic  others are a little slower  others have a few stretch marks  but nonetheless this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint. Other people are not as elastic. I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet. He doesn't want to put high speed Internet at home. And that's because there's some little bit of fear  little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms. So designers work on this particular malaise that we have  these kinds of discomforts that we have  and try to make life easier for us. Elasticity of mind is something that we really need  you know  we really need  we really cherish and we really work on. And this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic  and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity. And one last thing is that it's not only designers  but it's also scientists. And before I launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview  I would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design. You can say that the relationship between science and design goes back centuries. You can of course talk about Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women    and there's a gigantic history behind it. But according to a really great science historian you might know  Peter Galison    he teaches at Harvard    what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest  this real passion for design. So basically  the idea of being able to build things bottom up  atom by atom  has made them all into tinkerers. And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers  just like designers are seeking scientists. It's a brand new love affair that we're trying to cultivate at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly  who is the founder of Seed magazine    that's now a multimedia company  you might know it    we founded about a year ago a monthly salon for designers and scientists  and it's quite beautiful. And Keith has come  and also Jonathan has come and many others. And it was great  because at the beginning was this apology fest    you know  scientists would tell designers  you know  I don't know what style is  I'm not really elegant. And designers would like  oh  I don't know how to do an equation  I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden they really started talking each others' language  and now we're already at the point that they collaborate. Paul Steinhardt  a physicist from New York  and Aranda Lasch  architects  collaborated in an installation in London at the Serpentine. And it's really interesting to see how this happens. The exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists  and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us. I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now  just to give you a taste of it. Nanophysics and nanotechnology  for instance  have really opened the designer's mind. In this case I'm showing more the designers' work  because they're the ones that have really been stimulated. A lot of the objects in the show are concepts  not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here is the work of some scientists from UCLA. This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins    not only by color but literally by alphabet letters. So they construct it  and they can construct all kinds of forms at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students from the Royal College of Arts in London that have been working together with their tutor  Tony Dunne  and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future. New sensing elements on the body    you can grow hairs on your nails  and therefore grab some of the particles from another person. They seem very  very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate. So they're working on enhancing everything  touch  smell    everything they can  in order to find the perfect mate. Very interesting. This is a typeface designer from Israel who has designed    he calls them  typosperma.  He's thinking    of course it's all a concept    of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa  I don't know how to say it in English    spermatazoi    in order to make them become    to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation.  Laughter  I tell you  designers are quite fantastic  you know. So  tissue design. In this case too  you have a mixture of scientists and designers. This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts. The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint. One of the assignments for a year was to work with in vitro meat. You know that already you can grow meat in vitro. In Australia they did it    this research company  called SymbioticA. But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty. And so  the assignment to the students was  how should the steak of tomorrow be  When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape  what should it be like  So this particular student  James King  went around the beautiful English countryside  picked the best  best cow that he could see  and then put her in the MRI machine. Then  he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat    of course  this is done with a Japanese resins food maker  but you know  in the future it could be made better    which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find. Instead  this element here is much more banal. Something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue  so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one    literally. So  this is indeed made of human bone tissue. This is SymbioticA  and they've been working    they were the first ones to do this in vitro meat    and now they've also done an in vitro coat  a leather coat. It's miniscule  but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one. So  we'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future. One of the most important topics of the show    you know  as anything in our life today  we can look at it from many  many different viewpoints  and at different levels. One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale. We change scale very often  we change resolution of screens  and we're not really fazed by it  we do it very comfortably. So you go  even in the exhibition  from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data    the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world. In this particular case a section will be devoted to information design. You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is  Human vs. Chimps     the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps. It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine. And here's the whole code of Pac Man  visualized with all the go to  go back to  also made into a beautiful choreography. And then also graphs by scientists  this beautiful diagraph of protein homology. Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics. We were discussing with Keith Shrubb  this morning the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations  otherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes. So they pick the worst background from any kind of PowerPoint presentation  the worst typeface. It's only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first  pretty     if we can say so    scientific presentations. Another aspect of contemporary design that I think is mind opening  promising and will really be the future of design  is the idea of collective design. You know  the whole XO laptop  from One Laptop per Child  is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking. So  the more the merrier. The more computers  the stronger the signal  and children work on the interface so that it's all based on doing things together  tasks together. So the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future  and this is chosen as an example. Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the collectiveness  collectivity is the idea of existence maximum. That's a term that I coined a few years ago while I was thinking of how pressed we are together  and at the same time how these small objects  like the Walkman first and then the iPod  create bubbles of space around us that enable us to have a metaphysical space that is much bigger than our physical space. You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your iPod. And this is the work of several designers that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion by means of various techniques. This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa  you have a massage  you have a facial  maybe a rub  and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature  and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time. And same thing here  Social Tele presence. It's actually already used by the military a little bit  but it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else with your senses while you're removed from it physically. And this is called Blind Date. It's a  unclear   so if you're too shy to be really at the date  you can stay at a distance with your flowers and somebody else reenacts the date for you. Rapid manufacturing is another big area in which technology and design are  I think  bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times. Rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine. It used to be called rapid prototyping  rapid modeling. It started out in the '  s  but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very  very fragile  and could not have any real use. Slowly but surely  the materials became better    better resins. Techniques became better    not only carving but also stereolithography and laser    solidifying all kinds of resins  whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger  to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing. It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair  but you know what  One day it will take seven hours. And then the dream is that you'll be able to  from home  customize your chair. You know  companies and designers will be designing the matrix or the margins that respect both solidity and brand  and design identity. And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner and go get your chair. Now  the implications of this are enormous  not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process  but also no tracking  no warehousing  no wasted materials. Also  I can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change. And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine    you know  the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much    that shows you can have your desktop  D printer and print your own basketball. But here instead are examples  you can already  D print textiles  which is very interesting. This is just a really nice touch    it's called slow prototyping. It's a designer that put        bees at work and they built this vase. They had a particular shape that they had to stay in. Mapping and tagging. As the capacity of computers becomes really  really big  and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger  we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace our path. Also  we do it in order to share with other people. Again  this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today. So  various ways to map and tag are also the work of many designers nowadays. Also  the senses    designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more. And also animal senses in a way. This particular object that many people love so much is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment    the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense  and so    much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer    bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex to detect one type of cancer  and also pregnancy. And so this student at the RCA designed this beautiful blown glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies  in this case  pregnancy. Another shape is made for cancer. Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves. Some designers don't design objects  products  things that we're going to actually use  but rather  they design scenarios that are object based. They're still very useful. They help companies and other designers think better about the future. And usually they are accompanied by videos. This is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby   All the Robots.  Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of. We always think that robots will take care of us  and instead they designed these robots that are very  very needy. You need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something. Another one gets really  really nervous if you get in to the room  and starts shaking  so you have to calm it down. So it's really a way to make us think more about what robots mean to us. Noam Toran and  Accessories for Lonely Men   the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup  what you miss the most are those annoying things that you used to hate when you were with the other person. So he designed all these series of accessories. This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night. Then there's another one that breathes on your neck. There's another one that throws plates and breaks them. So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life. Elio Caccavale  he took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia. He's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation  and also the spider gene into the goat  from a few years ago. He's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls that explain to children where babies come from today. Because it's not anymore Mom  Dad  the flowers and the bees  and then there's the baby. No  it can be two moms  three dads  in vitro    there's the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed. So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now. One of the most beautiful things is that designers really work on life  even though they take technology into account. And many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning  and what we can do about it today with new technologies. Or how we should behave about it with new technologies. These three objects over there are hard drives with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality very  very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away. So instead of having only the pictures  you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden have  you know  Gertrude's whole life and all of her files and her address book come alive. And this is even better. This is Auger Loizeau   AfterLife.  It's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife. So to give them something tangible that shows that there is something after death  they take the gastric juices of people who passed away and concentrate them  and put them into a battery that can actually be used to power flashlights. They also go    you know  sex toys  whatever. It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile  can make you laugh  can make you cry sometimes. But I'm hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going    which is always  hopefully  a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going. Thank you very much.\n",
      "What do you think of when I say the word  design   You probably think of things like this  finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand  or maybe logos and posters and maps that visually explain things  classic icons of timeless design. But I'm not here to talk about that kind of design. I want to talk about the kind that you probably use every day and may not give much thought to  designs that change all the time and that live inside your pocket. I'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically the design of systems that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend. Consider the fact that Google processes over one billion search queries every day  that every minute  over     hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube. That's more in a single day than all three major U.S. networks broadcast in the last five years combined. And Facebook transmitting the photos  messages and stories of over  .   billion people. That's almost half of the Internet population  and a sixth of humanity. These are some of the products that I've helped design over the course of my career  and their scale is so massive that they've produced unprecedented design challenges. But what is really hard about designing at scale is this  It's hard in part because it requires a combination of two things  audacity and humility   audacity to believe that the thing that you're making is something that the entire world wants and needs  and humility to understand that as a designer  it's not about you or your portfolio  it's about the people that you're designing for  and how your work just might help them live better lives. Now  unfortunately  there's no school that offers the course Designing for Humanity    . I and the other designers who work on these kinds of products have had to invent it as we go along  and we are teaching ourselves the emerging best practices of designing at scale  and today I'd like share some of the things that we've learned over the years. Now  the first thing that you need to know about designing at scale is that the little things really matter. Here's a really good example of how a very tiny design element can make a big impact. The team at Facebook that manages the Facebook  Like  button decided that it needed to be redesigned. The button had kind of gotten out of sync with the evolution of our brand and it needed to be modernized. Now you might think  well  it's a tiny little button  it probably is a pretty straightforward  easy design assignment  but it wasn't. Turns out  there were all kinds of constraints for the design of this button. You had to work within specific height and width parameters. You had to be careful to make it work in a bunch of different languages  and be careful about using fancy gradients or borders because it has to degrade gracefully in old web browsers. The truth is  designing this tiny little button was a huge pain in the butt. Now  this is the new version of the button  and the designer who led this project estimates that he spent over     hours redesigning this button over the course of months. Now  why would we spend so much time on something so small  It's because when you're designing at scale  there's no such thing as a small detail. This innocent little button is seen on average    billion times a day and on over  .  million websites. It's one of the single most viewed design elements ever created. Now that's a lot of pressure for a little button and the designer behind it  but with these kinds of products  you need to get even the tiny things right. Now  the next thing that you need to understand is how to design with data. Now  when you're working on products like this  you have incredible amounts of information about how people are using your product that you can then use to influence your design decisions  but it's not just as simple as following the numbers. Let me give you an example so that you can understand what I mean. Facebook has had a tool for a long time that allowed people to report photos that may be in violation of our community standards  things like spam and abuse. And there were a ton of photos reported  but as it turns out  only a small percentage were actually in violation of those community standards. Most of them were just your typical party photo. Now  to give you a specific hypothetical example  let's say my friend Laura hypothetically uploads a picture of me from a drunken night of karaoke. This is purely hypothetical  I can assure you. Now  incidentally  you know how some people are kind of worried that their boss or employee is going to discover embarrassing photos of them on Facebook  Do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at Facebook  So anyway  there are lots of these photos being erroneously reported as spam and abuse  and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch. He really thought there was something else going on and he was right  because when he looked through a bunch of the cases  he found that most of them were from people who were requesting the takedown of a photo of themselves. Now this was a scenario that the team never even took into account before. So they added a new feature that allowed people to message their friend to ask them to take the photo down. But it didn't work. Only    percent of people sent the message to their friend. So the team went back at it. They consulted with experts in conflict resolution. They even studied the universal principles of polite language  which I didn't even actually know existed until this research happened. And they found something really interesting. They had to go beyond just helping people ask their friend to take the photo down. They had to help people express to their friend how the photo made them feel. Here's how the experience works today. So I find this hypothetical photo of myself  and it's not spam  it's not abuse  but I really wish it weren't on the site. So I report it and I say   I'm in this photo and I don't like it   and then we dig deeper. Why don't you like this photo of yourself  And I select  It's embarrassing.  And then I'm encouraged to message my friend  but here's the critical difference. I'm provided specific suggested language that helps me communicate to Laura how the photo makes me feel. Now the team found that this relatively small change had a huge impact. Before  only    percent of people were sending the message  and now    percent were  and surveys showed that people on both sides of the conversation felt better as a result. That same survey showed that    percent of your friends want to know if they've done something to upset you. Now I don't know who the other    percent are  but maybe that's where our  Unfriend  feature can come in handy. So as you can see  these decisions are highly nuanced. Of course we use a lot of data to inform our decisions  but we also rely very heavily on iteration  research  testing  intuition  human empathy. It's both art and science. Now  sometimes the designers who work on these products are called  data driven   which is a term that totally drives us bonkers. The fact is  it would be irresponsible of us not to rigorously test our designs when so many people are counting on us to get it right  but data analytics will never be a substitute for design intuition. Data can help you make a good design great  but it will never made a bad design good. The next thing that you need to understand as a principle is that when you introduce change  you need to do it extraordinarily carefully. Now I often have joked that I spend almost as much time designing the introduction of change as I do the change itself  and I'm sure that we can all relate to that when something that we use a lot changes and then we have to adjust. The fact is  people can become very efficient at using bad design  and so even if the change is good for them in the long run  it's still incredibly frustrating when it happens  and this is particularly true with user generated content platforms  because people can rightfully claim a sense of ownership. It is  after all  their content. Now  years ago  when I was working at YouTube  we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos  and it was interesting because when we looked into the data  we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five star rating  a handful of people were using the lowest one star  and virtually no one was using two  three or four stars. So we decided to simplify into an up down kind of voting binary model. It's going to be much easier for people to engage with. But people were very attached to the five star rating system. Video creators really loved their ratings. Millions and millions of people were accustomed to the old design. So in order to help people prepare themselves for change and acclimate to the new design more quickly  we actually published the data graph sharing with the community the rationale for what we were going to do  and it even engaged the larger industry in a conversation  which resulted in my favorite TechCrunch headline of all time   YouTube Comes to a   Star Realization  Its Ratings Are Useless.  Now  it's impossible to completely avoid change aversion when you're making changes to products that so many people use. Even though we tried to do all the right things  we still received our customary flood of video protests and angry emails and even a package that had to be scanned by security  but we have to remember people care intensely about this stuff  and it's because these products  this work  really  really matters to them. Now  we know that we have to be careful about paying attention to the details  we have to be cognizant about how we use data in our design process  and we have to introduce change very  very carefully. Now  these things are all really useful. They're good best practices for designing at scale. But they don't mean anything if you don't understand something much more fundamental. You have to understand who you are designing for. Now  when you set a goal to design for the entire human race  and you start to engage in that goal in earnest  at some point you run into the walls of the bubble that you're living in. Now  in San Francisco  we get a little miffed when we hit a dead cell zone because we can't use our phones to navigate to the new hipster coffee shop. But what if you had to drive four hours to charge your phone because you had no reliable source of electricity  What if you had no access to public libraries  What if your country had no free press  What would these products start to mean to you  This is what Google  YouTube and Facebook look like to most of the world  and it's what they'll look like to most of the next five billion people to come online. Designing for low end cell phones is not glamorous design work  but if you want to design for the whole world  you have to design for where people are  and not where you are. So how do we keep this big  big picture in mind  We try to travel outside of our bubble to see  hear and understand the people we're designing for. We use our products in non English languages to make sure that they work just as well. And we try to use one of these phones from time to time to keep in touch with their reality. So what does it mean to design at a global scale  It means difficult and sometimes exasperating work to try to improve and evolve products. Finding the audacity and the humility to do right by them can be pretty exhausting  and the humility part  it's a little tough on the design ego. Because these products are always changing  everything that I've designed in my career is pretty much gone  and everything that I will design will fade away. But here's what remains  the never ending thrill of being a part of something that is so big  you can hardly get your head around it  and the promise that it just might change the world. Thank you.\n",

      "We're here to celebrate compassion. But compassion  from my vantage point  has a problem. As essential as it is across our traditions  as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives  the word  compassion  is hollowed out in our culture  and it is suspect in my field of journalism. It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing  or it's seen as potentially depressing. Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and  after the fact  the word  compassion  was translated as  pity.  Now compassion  when it enters the news  too often comes in the form of feel good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time. Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images. And so what I'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection. And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter  that they shape the way we understand ourselves  the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others. When this country first encountered genuine diversity in the     s  we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that. Now the word  tolerance   if you look at it in the dictionary  connotes  allowing    indulging  and  enduring.  In the medical context that it comes from  it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment. Tolerance is not really a lived virtue  it's more of a cerebral ascent. And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough. And the going is pretty rough right now. I think that without perhaps being able to name it  we are collectively experiencing that we've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue. Compassion is a worthy successor. It is organic  across our religious  spiritual and ethical traditions  and yet it transcends them. Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others  both in our private and in our civic spaces. So what is it  three dimensionally  What are its kindred and component parts  What's in its universe of attendant virtues  To start simply  I want to say that compassion is kind. Now  kindness  might sound like a very mild word  and it's prone to its own abundant cliche. But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues. And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification. Compassion is also curious. Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity. I love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles  Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi. They are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young Jews and Muslims  and as they do that  they cultivate what they call  curiosity without assumptions.  Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion. Compassion can be synonymous with empathy. It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation  but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence. It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there  just showing up. I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty    and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other  not just what it is about them that might need helping. I love it that my Muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value. And in that light  for the religious  compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery    encouraging us not just to see beauty  but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering  in the face of a stranger  in the face of the vibrant religious other. I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like  but I can show you what compassion looks like    because it is visible. When we see it  we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable  what is possible. It is so important when we're communicating big ideas    but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion    to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood    the color and complexity of life. And compassion does seek physicality. I first started to learn this most vividly from Matthew Sanford. And I don't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him  but he's paraplegic. He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was     in a car crash that killed his father and his sister. Matthew's legs don't work  and he'll never walk again  and    and he does experience this as an  and  rather than a  but     and he experiences himself to be healed and whole. And as a teacher of yoga  he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability  health  illness and aging. He says that he's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we're all on. He's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit. I can't quite explain it  and he can't either. But he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body  in all its frailty and its grace  without  at the same time  becoming more compassionate towards all of life. Compassion also looks like this. This is Jean Vanier. Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities  which you can now find all over the world  communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities    mostly Down syndrome. The communities that Jean Vanier founded  like Jean Vanier himself  exude tenderness.  Tender  is another word I would love to spend some time resurrecting. We spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive  and I spend a lot of time being those things too. And compassion can also have those qualities. But again and again  lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness. Jean Vanier says that his work  like the work of other people    his great  beloved  late friend Mother Teresa    is never in the first instance about changing the world  it's in the first instance about changing ourselves. He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution  but a sign. Compassion is rarely a solution  but it is always a sign of a deeper reality  of deeper human possibilities. And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories  never by statistics and strategies. We need those things too  but we're also bumping up against their limits. And at the same time that we are doing that  I think we are rediscovering the power of story    that as human beings  we need stories to survive  to flourish  to change. Our traditions have always known this  and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us. There is  of course  a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world    tikkun olam. And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen  who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her  that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces. It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation. And that the highest human calling is to look for this light  to point at it when we see it  to gather it up  and in so doing  to repair the world. Now this might sound like a fanciful tale. Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way. Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time  because this story insists that each and every one of us  frail and flawed as we may be  inadequate as we may feel  has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch. Stories like this  signs like this  are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us. Rachel Naomi Remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors. And this trend of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing  how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine    the work Fred Luskin is doing    I think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the   st century    that science  in fact  is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism. This is going to change science  I believe  and it will change religion. But here's a face from   th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion. We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E   mc . We don't hear so much about the Einstein who invited the African American opera singer  Marian Anderson  to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn't have her. We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scottsboro boys in the American South. Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions. But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early   th century. He once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three year old. And Einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced  we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more  not less. He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages. Some of his favorites were Moses  Jesus  Buddha  St. Francis of Assisi  Gandhi    he adored his contemporary  Gandhi. And Einstein said    and I think this is a quote  again  that has not been passed down in his legacy    that  these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living  more necessary to the dignity  security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge.  Now invoking Einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us  but actually it is. I want to show you the rest of this photograph  because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word  compassion  in our culture    we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life  which is messy. So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral    it's not. This is the full photograph  and you see a middle aged man wearing a leather jacket  smoking a cigar. And by the look of that paunch  he hasn't been doing enough yoga. We put these two photographs side by side on our website  and someone said   When I look at the first photo  I ask myself  what was he thinking  And when I look at the second  I ask  what kind of person was he  What kind of man is this   Well  he was complicated. He was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others. And it is much harder  often  to be compassionate towards those closest to us  which is another quality in the universe of compassion  on its dark side  that also deserves our serious attention and illumination. Gandhi  too  was a real flawed human being. So was Martin Luther King  Jr. So was Dorothy Day. So was Mother Teresa. So are we all. And I want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion    following on what Fred Luskin says    that these flaws just make us human. Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems. But what a liberating thing to realize that our problems  in fact  are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion  towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others. Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor because of her life long struggle with Crohn's disease. Einstein became a humanitarian  not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter  but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist. And Karen Armstrong  I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that  with a zigzag  have led to the Charter for Compassion. Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity. So I want to propose a final definition of compassion    this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way    and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology. Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this  and we need them to mine it for us now. But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious. So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity  the future of humanity  needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race. Thank you.\n",
      "I want to address the issue of compassion. Compassion has many faces. Some of them are fierce  some of them are wrathful  some of them are tender  some of them are wise. A line that the Dalai Lama once said  he said   Love and compassion are necessities. They are not luxuries. Without them  humanity cannot survive.  And I would suggest  it is not only humanity that won't survive  but it is all species on the planet  as we've heard today. It is the big cats  and it's the plankton. Two weeks ago  I was in Bangalore in India. I was so privileged to be able to teach in a hospice on the outskirts of Bangalore. And early in the morning  I went into the ward. In that hospice  there were    men and women who were actively dying. And I walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly  fragile  obviously in the latter phase of active dying. I looked into her face. I looked into the face of her son sitting next to her  and his face was just riven with grief and confusion. And I remembered a line from the Mahabharata  the great Indian epic   What is the most wondrous thing in the world  Yudhisthira   And Yudhisthira replied   The most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don't realize it can happen to us.  I looked up. Tending those    dying people were young women from villages around Bangalore. I looked into the face of one of these women  and I saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present. I watched her hands as she bathed an old man. My gaze went to another young woman as she wiped the face of another dying person. And it reminded me of something that I had just been present for. Every year or so  I have the privilege of taking clinicians into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. And we run clinics in these very remote regions where there's no medical care whatsoever. And on the first day at Simikot in Humla  far west of Nepal  the most impoverished region of Nepal  an old man came in clutching a bundle of rags. And he walked in  and somebody said something to him  we realized he was deaf  and we looked into the rags  and there was this pair of eyes. The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned. Again  the eyes and hands of Avalokiteshvara. It was the young women  the health aids  who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds. I know those hands and eyes  they touched me as well. They touched me at that time. They have touched me throughout my    years. They touched me when I was four and I lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed. And my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me. And that woman did not have sentimental compassion. She had phenomenal strength. And it was really her strength  I believe  that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life. So we can ask  What is compassion comprised of  And there are various facets. And there's referential and non referential compassion. But first  compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering. It is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that I'm not separate from this suffering. But that is not enough  because compassion  which activates the motor cortex  means that we aspire  we actually aspire to transform suffering. And if we're so blessed  we engage in activities that transform suffering. But compassion has another component  and that component is really essential. That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome. Now I worked with dying people for over    years. I had the privilege of working on death row in a maximum security  prison  for six years. And I realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience  from working with dying people and training caregivers  that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe. And when I worked in the prison system  it was so clear to me  this  that many of us in this room  and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row  the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered. That compassion is actually an inherent human quality. It is there within every human being. But the conditions for compassion to be activated  to be aroused  are particular conditions. I had that condition  to a certain extent  from my own childhood illness. Eve Ensler  whom you'll hear later  has had that condition activated amazingly in her through the various waters of suffering that she has been through. And what is fascinating is that compassion has enemies  and those enemies are things like pity  moral outrage  fear. And you know  we have a society  a world  that is paralyzed by fear. And in that paralysis  of course  our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed. The very word terror is global. The very feeling of terror is global. So our work  in a certain way  is to address this imago  this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe. Now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities. For example  A person who is cultivating compassion  when they are in the presence of suffering  they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do. However  they return to baseline a lot sooner. This is called resilience. Many of us think that compassion drains us  but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us. Another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what's called neural integration. It hooks up all parts of the brain. Another  which has been discovered by various researchers at Emory and at Davis and so on  is that compassion enhances our immune system. Hey  we live in a very noxious world. Most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho social and physical poisons  of the toxins of our world. But compassion  the generation of compassion  actually mobilizes our immunity. You know  if compassion is so good for us  I have a question. Why don't we train our children in compassion  If compassion is so good for us  why don't we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they're supposed to do  which is to really transform suffering  And if compassion is so good for us  why don't we vote on compassion  Why don't we vote for people in our government based on compassion  so that we can have a more caring world  In Buddhism  we say   it takes a strong back and a soft front.  It takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions. And that is the mental quality of equanimity. But it also takes a soft front    the capacity to really be open to the world as it is  to have an undefended heart. And the archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara  Kuan Yin. It's a female archetype  she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world. She stands with        arms  and in every hand  there is an instrument of liberation  and in the palm of every hand  there are eyes  and these are the eyes of wisdom. I say that  for thousands of years  women have lived  exemplified  met in intimacy  the archetype of Avalokitesvara  of Kuan Yin  she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world. Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered  unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is. They have infused societies with kindness  and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half. And they have actualized compassion through direct action. Jody Williams called it  It's good to meditate. I'm sorry  you've got to do a little bit of that  Jody. Step back  give your mother a break  okay. But the other side of the equation is you've got to come out of your cave. You have to come into the world like Asanga did  who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha after    years sitting in the cave. He said   I'm out of here.  He's going down the path. He sees something in the path. He looks  it's a dog  he drops to his knees. He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg. The wound is just filled with maggots. He puts out his tongue in order to remove the maggots  so as not to harm them. And at that moment  the dog transformed into the Buddha of love and kindness. I believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men    with their fathers  with their sons  with their brothers  with the plumbers  the road builders  the caregivers  the doctors  the lawyers  with our president  and with all beings. The women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire. May we actualize that capacity for women everywhere. Thank you.\n",
      "So what does the happiest man in the world look like  He certainly doesn't look like me. He looks like this. His name is Matthieu Ricard. So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world  Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain. And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI  versus the right prefrontal cortex. And Matthieu's happiness measure is off the charts. He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science. Which leads us to a question  What was he thinking when he was being measured  Perhaps something very naughty. Actually  he was meditating on compassion. Matthieu's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever. Reading about Matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life. My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime    and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale. And learning about Matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work. Matthieu's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore. Compassion is something that creates happiness. Compassion is fun. And that mind blowing insight changes the entire game. Because if compassion was a chore  nobody's going to do it  except maybe the Dalai Lama or something. But if compassion was fun  everybody's going to do it. Therefore  to create the conditions for global compassion  all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun. But fun is not enough. What if compassion is also profitable  What if compassion is also good for business  Then  every boss  every manager in the world  will want to have compassion    like this. That would create the conditions for world peace. So  I started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting. Fortunately  I didn't have to look very far. Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes    in Google  my company. I know there are other compassionate companies in the world  but Google is the place I'm familiar with because I've been there for    years  so I'll use Google as the case study. Google is a company born of idealism. It's a company that thrives on idealism. And maybe because of that  compassion is organic and widespread company wide. In Google  expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern. It's sort of a funny pattern. It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something. And they don't usually ask for permission  they just go ahead and do it  and then other Googlers join in  and it just gets bigger and bigger. And sometimes it gets big enough to become official. So in other words  it almost always starts from the bottom up. And let me give you some examples. The first example is the largest annual community event    where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities    was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official  because it just became too big. Another example  three Googlers    a chef  an engineer and  most funny  a massage therapist    three of them  they learned about a region in India where         people live without a single medical facility. So what do they do  They just go ahead and start a fundraiser. And they raise enough money to build this hospital    the first hospital of its kind for         people. During the Haiti earthquake  a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones. And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices. In China for example  one mid level employee initiated the largest social action competition in China  involving more than       schools in China  working on issues such as education  poverty  health care and the environment. There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts. And this idea  again  came from the grassroots  from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job. And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy. It was two persons saying   Let's do this   and the company said   Yes.  So it turns out that Google is a compassionate company  because Googlers found compassion to be fun. But again  fun is not enough. There are also real business benefits. So what are they  The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders. What does that mean  There are three components of compassion. There is the affective component  which is   I feel for you.  There is the cognitive component  which is   I understand you.  And there is a motivational component  which is   I want to help you.  So what has this got to do with business leadership  According to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins  and documented in the book  Good to Great   it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness. And he calls them  Level   leaders.  These are leaders who  in addition to being highly capable  possess two important qualities  and they are humility and ambition. These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good. And because they're ambitious for a greater good  they feel no need to inflate their own egos. And they  according to the research  make the best business leaders. And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion  we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion    understanding people and empathizing with people    inhibits  tones down  what I call the excessive self obsession that's in us  therefore creating the conditions for humility. The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good. In other words  compassion is the way to grow Level   leaders. And this is the first compelling business benefit. The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce. Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good. It creates a vibrant  energetic community where people admire and respect each other. I mean  you come to work in the morning  and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India. It's like how can you not be inspired by those people    your own coworkers  So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration  initiative and creativity. It makes us a highly effective company. So  having said all that  what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting  In our experience  there are three ingredients. The first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good. So always think  how is your company and your job serving the greater good  Or  how can you further serve the greater good  This awareness of serving the greater good is very self inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in. That's one. The second ingredient is autonomy. So in Google  there's a lot of autonomy. And one of our most popular managers jokes that  this is what he says   Google is a place where the inmates run the asylum.  And he considers himself one of the inmates. If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free  they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way. The third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth. Leadership training in Google  for example  places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities  such as self awareness  self mastery  empathy and compassion  because we believe that leadership begins with character. We even created a seven week curriculum on emotion intelligence  which we jokingly call  Searching Inside Yourself.  It's less naughty than it sounds. So I'm an engineer by training  but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course  which I find kind of funny  because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence. What a company. So  Search Inside Yourself     how does it work  It works in three steps. The first step is attention training. Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities. Therefore  any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training. The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time. And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence. The second step follows the first step. The second step is developing self knowledge and self mastery. So using the supercharged attention from step one  we create a high resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes. What does that mean  It means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity  objectivity and from a third person perspective. And once you can do that  you create the kind of self knowledge that enables self mastery. The third step  following the second step  is to create new mental habits. What does that mean  Imagine this. Imagine whenever you meet any other person  any time you meet a person  your habitual  instinctive first thought is   I want you to be happy. I want you to be happy.  Imagine you can do that. Having this habit  this mental habit  changes everything at work. Because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people  and it creates trust  and trust creates a lot of good working relationships. And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace. Someday  we hope to open source  Search Inside Yourself  so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference. And in closing  I want to end the same place I started  with happiness. I want to quote this guy    the guy in robes  not the other guy    the Dalai Lama  who said   If you want others to be happy  practice compassion. If you want to be happy  practice compassion.  I found this to be true  both on the individual level and at a corporate level. And I hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too. Thank you.\n",
      "A human child is born  and for quite a long time is a consumer. It cannot be consciously a contributor. It is helpless. It doesn't know how to survive  even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive. It needs the help of mother  or a foster mother  to survive. It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child. It has to totally surrender  as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist. It has to totally surrender. That implies a lot of trust. That implies the trusted person won't violate the trust. As the child grows  it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust. It doesn't know even the word  violation.  Therefore  it has to blame itself  a wordless blame  which is more difficult to really resolve    the wordless self blame. As the child grows to become an adult  so far  it has been a consumer  but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute  to be a contributor. One cannot contribute unless one feels secure  one feels big  one feels  I have enough. To be compassionate is not a joke. It's not that simple. One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself. That bigness should be centered on oneself  not in terms of money  not in terms of power you wield  not in terms of any status that you can command in the society  but it should be centered on oneself. The self  you are self aware. On that self  it should be centered    a bigness  a wholeness. Otherwise  compassion is just a word and a dream. You can be compassionate occasionally  more moved by empathy than by compassion. Thank God we are empathetic. When somebody's in pain  we pick up the pain. In a Wimbledon final match  these two guys fight it out. Each one has got two games. It can be anybody's game. What they have sweated so far has no meaning. One person wins. The tennis etiquette is  both the players have to come to the net and shake hands. The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground  throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it. And this guy has to come to the net. When he comes to the net  you see  his whole face changes. It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win. Why  Empathy. That's human heart. No human heart is denied of that empathy. No religion can demolish that by indoctrination. No culture  no nation and nationalism    nothing can touch it because it is empathy. And that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people  you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life    even words  even time. Compassion is not defined in one form. There's no Indian compassion. There's no American compassion. It transcends nation  the gender  the age. Why  Because it is there in everybody. It's experienced by people occasionally. Then this occasional compassion  we are not talking about    it will never remain occasional. By mandate  you cannot make a person compassionate. You can't say   Please love me.  Love is something you discover. It's not an action  but in the English language  it is also an action. I will come to it later. So one has got to discover a certain wholeness. I am going to cite the possibility of being whole  which is within our experience  everybody's experience. In spite of a very tragic life  one is happy in moments which are very few and far between. And the one who is happy  even for a slapstick joke  accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself. That means the whole universe  known things and unknown things. All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself. The subject     me     and the object    the scheme of things    fuse into oneness  an experience nobody can say   I am denied of   an experience common to all and sundry. That experience confirms that  in spite of all your limitations    all your wants  desires  unfulfilled  and the credit cards and layoffs and  finally  baldness    you can be happy. But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy. You are the very happiness  the wholeness that you want to be. There's no choice in this  that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you  cannot be minus you. It has got to be you. You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole. Your moment of happiness reveals that reality  that realization  that recognition   Maybe I am the whole. Maybe the swami is right. Maybe the swami is right.  You start your new life. Then everything becomes meaningful. I have no more reason to blame myself. If one has to blame oneself  one has a million reasons plus many. But if I say  in spite of my body being limited    if it is black it is not white  if it is white it is not black  body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited. Your knowledge is limited  health is limited  and power is therefore limited  and the cheerfulness is going to be limited. Compassion is going to be limited. Everything is going to be limitless. You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless  and nobody can become limitless  either you are or you are not. Period. And there is no way of your being not limitless too. Your own experience reveals  in spite of all limitations  you are the whole. And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world. It is love first. When you relate to the world  the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is  what we say  love. And itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion. Then that again transforms into giving  into sharing. You express yourself because you have compassion. To discover compassion  you need to be compassionate. To discover the capacity to give and share  you need to be giving and sharing. There is no shortcut  it is like swimming by swimming. You learn swimming by swimming. You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water. You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling. You learn cooking by cooking  having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook. And  therefore  what I say  you have to fake it and make it. You need to. My predecessor meant that. You have to act it out. You have to act compassionately. There is no verb for compassion  but you have an adverb for compassion. That's interesting to me. You act compassionately. But then  how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion  That is where you fake. You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America. You fake it and make it. You act compassionately as though you have compassion  grind your teeth  take all the support system. If you know how to pray  pray. Ask for compassion. Let me act compassionately. Do it. You'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion  and slowly  perhaps if you get the right teaching  you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself  which is oneness  wholeness  and that's what you are. With these words  thank you very much.\n",
      "I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement  just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the   th century also agrees with us  and also calls us to this action. He said   A human being is a part of the whole  called by us  the 'universe '    a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself  his thoughts and feelings  as something separated from the rest  a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us  restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion  to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  This insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology  wherein compassion     karuna   it is called    is defined as   the sensitivity to another's suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering.  It pairs closely with love  which is the will for the other to be happy  which requires  of course  that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it. This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self centeredness and selfishness to compassion  the concern for others  and  further  it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self concern suffer helplessly  while the compassionate are more free and  implicitly  more happy. The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend. It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair. Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute  most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others  even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings. In fact  suffering is so huge and enormous  his own becomes less and less monumental. And he begins to move beyond his self concern into the broader concern for others. And this immediately cheers him up  as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion. Thus  he uses his own suffering as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion. He is a very good colleague of Einstein's  we must say. Now  I want to tell a story  which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition  of the great Saint Asanga who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine. And Asanga lived     years after the Buddha's time. And he was discontented with the state of people's practice of the Buddhist religion in India at that time. And so he said   I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine. They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment  but they are acting selfish and pathetic. So  Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum. I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now  but exists currently in a certain heaven     that's Maitreya     so  I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me  and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today.  So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya. And he left in disgust. And as he was leaving  he saw a man    a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain. And he had a lump of iron. And he was rubbing it with a cloth. And he became interested in that. He said   Well what are you doing   And the man said   I'm making a needle.  And he said   That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth.  And the man said   Really   And he showed him a dish full of needles. So he said   Okay  I get the point.  He went back to his cave. He meditated again. Another three years  no vision. He leaves again. This time  he comes down. And as he's leaving  he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge. And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff  its feathers brushes the rock    and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds. So he said   All right. I get the point.  He went back. Another three years. Again  no vision of Maitreya after nine years. And he again leaves  and this time  water dripping  making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream. And so  again  he goes back. And after    years there is still no vision. And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision. And he comes to the town. He's a broken person. And there  in the town  he's approached by a dog who comes like this    one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries  even in America  I think  in some areas    and he's looking just terrible. And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic  and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog. And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore. Some of it is like gangrenous  and there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible. He thinks   What can I do to fix up this dog  Well  at least I can clean this wound and wash it.  So  he takes it to some water. He's about to clean  but then his awareness focuses on the maggots. And he sees the maggots  and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute. And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.  Well  if I clean the dog  I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be  That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha  no Maitreya  and everything is all hopeless. And now I'm going to kill the maggots   So  he had a brilliant idea. And he took a shard of something  and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh  and he placed it on ground. He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA. He was just immediately caught with the situation. So he thought   I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh  then clean the dog's wounds  and then I'll figure out what to do with the maggots.  So he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots. Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab  these maggots. So he says   Well  I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh. And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue     the dog is kind of used up     and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing.  So he goes down  and he's sticking his tongue out like this. And he had to close his eyes  it's so disgusting  and the smell and everything. And then  suddenly  there's a pfft  a noise like that. He jumps back and there  of course  is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision    rainbow lights  golden  jeweled  a plasma body  an exquisite mystic vision    that he sees. And he says   Oh.  He bows. But  being human  he's immediately thinking of his next complaint. So as he comes up from his first bow he says   My Lord  I'm so happy to see you  but where have you been for    years  What is this   And Maitreya says   I was with you. Who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you  mister dense    Looking for the Buddha in person   he said. And he said   You didn't have  until this moment  real compassion. And  until you have real compassion  you cannot recognize love.   Maitreya  means love   the loving one   in Sanskrit. And so he looked very dubious  Asanga did. And he said   If you don't believe me  just take me with you.  And so he took the Maitreya    it shrunk into a globe  a ball    took him on his shoulder. And he ran into town in the marketplace  and he said   Rejoice  Rejoice  The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is.  And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him    it wasn't Chautauqua  it was some other town    because they saw a demented looking  scrawny looking yogi man  like some kind of hippie  with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder  shouting that the future Buddha had come. So  naturally  they chased him out of town. But on the edge of town  one elderly lady  a charwoman in the charnel ground  saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog  but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya  and she offered a flower. So that encouraged him  and he went with Maitreya. Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven  which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds. And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years  dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion. And then I thought I would share with you what that method is  or one of them. A famous one  it's called the  Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion.  And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one    even animals too  but everyone is in human form. The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human. And then  among them  you think of your friends and loved ones  the circle at the table. And you think of your enemies  and you think of the neutral ones. And then you try to say   Well  the loved ones I love. But  you know  after all  they're nice to me. I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly. I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight. So  in a way  I like them so much because they're nice to me. While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine. And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me. But they are nice to somebody. I could be them.  And then the Buddhists  of course  think that  because we've all had infinite previous lives  we've all been each other's relatives  actually. Therefore all of you  in the Buddhist view  in some previous life  although you don't remember it and neither do I  have been my mother    for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you. And also  actually  I've been your mother. I've been female  and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life  the way the Buddhists reflect. So  my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother. You gave me that expression   the eternal mama   you said. That's wonderful. So  that's the way the Buddhists do it. A theist Christian can think that all beings  even my enemies  are God's children. So  in that sense  we're related. So  they first create this foundation of equality. So  we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love    just in the meditation    and we open our mind to those we don't know. And we definitely reduce the hostility and the  I don't want to be compassionate to them  to the ones we think of as the bad guys  the ones we hate and we don't like. And we don't hate anyone  therefore. So we equalize. That's very important. And then the next thing we do is what is called  mother recognition.  And that is  we think of every being as familiar  as family. We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama  and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation. And we see the mother in every being. We see that look that the mother has on her face  looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body  being a mammal  where she has true compassion  truly is the other  and identifies completely. Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life. And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism. The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings  in spiritual traditions. And so  we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings. People laugh at me because  you know  I used to say that I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom  when  of course  I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq. I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form. He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms. And you think of him as nursing you. And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem  but you think of him as a mom. And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you  and you see how they could be familiar to you. And you do that for a while  until you really feel that. You can feel the familiarity of all beings. Nobody seems alien. They're not  other.  You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings. Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general  if you can remember the kindness of your own mother  if you can remember the kindness of your spouse  or  if you are a mother yourself  how you were with your children. And you begin to get very sentimental  you cultivate sentimentality intensely. You will even weep  perhaps  with gratitude and kindness. And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility. Every being  even the most mean looking ones  can be motherly. And then  third  you step from there to what is called  a feeling of gratitude.  You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you. And then the fourth step  you go to what is called  lovely love.  In each one of these you can take some weeks  or months  or days depending on how you do it  or you can do them in a run  this meditation. And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy  when they are satisfied. And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness. Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry  they look ugly  every being  but when they're happy they look beautiful. And so you see beings in their potential happiness. And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy  even the enemy. We think Jesus is being unrealistic when he says   Love thine enemy.  He does say that  and we think he's being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin.  Nice for him to say it  but I can't do that.  But  actually  that's practical. If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy. If your enemy was really happy  why would they bother to be your enemy  How boring to run around chasing you. They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time. So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy  because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble. But anyway  that's the  lovely love.   And then finally  the fifth step is compassion   universal compassion.  And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of. And you look at them  and you see how they are. And you realize how unhappy they are actually  mostly  most of the time. You see that furrowed brow in people. And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves. They're driven by this duty and this obligation.  I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something.  And they're rushing around all stressed out. And they think of it as somehow macho  hard discipline on themselves. But actually they are cruel to themselves. And  of course  they are cruel and ruthless toward others. And they  then  never get any positive feedback. And the more they succeed and the more power they have  the more unhappy they are. And this is where you feel real compassion for them. And you then feel you must act. And the choice of the action  of course  hopefully will be more practical than poor Asanga  who was fixing the maggots on the dog because he had that motivation  and whoever was in front of him  he wanted to help. But  of course  that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots. And I'm sure he did that later.  Laughter  But that just indicates the state of mind  you know. And so the next step    the sixth step beyond  universal compassion     is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way  and you have compassion for yourself also  and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something. Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future for it in various ways. And in Buddhism  they catch it in the future life. Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever. And materialism  they think they get out of it just by not existing  by dying  but they don't. And so they get reborn as whatever  you know. Never mind. I won't get into that. But the next step is called  universal responsibility.  And that is very important    the Charter of Compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion  what is called  universal responsibility.  In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama that he always teaches everywhere  he says that that is the common religion of humanity  kindness. But  kindness  means  universal responsibility.  And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us  we are responsible for that  and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it. We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it. And then  finally  that leads to a new orientation in life where we live equally for ourselves and for others and we are joyful and happy. One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable. Compassion makes you happy. The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself  even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else. Although  the change in your mind already does something for other beings  they can sense this new quality in yourself  and it helps them already  and gives them an example. And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over. So  practice compassion  read the charter  disseminate it and develop it within yourself. Don't just think   Well  I'm compassionate   or  I'm not compassionate   and sort of think you're stuck there. You can develop this. You can diminish the non compassion  the cruelty  the callousness  the neglect of others  and take universal responsibility for them. And then  not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile  but Karen Armstrong will smile. Thank you very much.  Applause \n",

      "So the machine I'm going to talk you about is what I call the greatest machine that never was. It was a machine that was never built  and yet  it will be built. It was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers. If you know anything about the history of computers  you will know that in the '  s and the '  s  simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today  and you would be correct  except for you'd have the wrong century. The first computer was really designed in the     s and     s  not the     s and     s. It was designed  and parts of it were prototyped  and the bits of it that were built are here in South Kensington. That machine was built by this guy  Charles Babbage. Now  I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture.  Laughter  He was a very wealthy man  and a sort of  part of the aristocracy of Britain  and on a Saturday night in Marylebone  were you part of the intelligentsia of that period  you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree   and he invited everybody  kings  the Duke of Wellington  many  many famous people   and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines. I really miss that era  you know  where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you.  Laughter  But Babbage  Babbage himself was born at the end of the   th century  and was a fairly famous mathematician. He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge  and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking. He's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them. The reason he never made any of them  he's a classic nerd. Every time he had a good idea  he'd think   That's brilliant  I'm going to start building that one. I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea. I'm going to work on this one.  Laughter  And I'm going to do this one.  He did this until Sir Robert Peel  then Prime Minister  basically kicked him out of Number    Downing Street  and kicking him out  in those days  that meant saying   I bid you good day  sir.   Laughter  The thing he designed was this monstrosity here  the analytical engine. Now  just to give you an idea of this  this is a view from above. Every one of these circles is a cog  a stack of cogs  and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive. So as I go through this talk  I want you to imagine this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like. And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine   that's why it's computer architecture   and tell you about this machine  which is a computer. So let's talk about the memory. The memory is very like the memory of a computer today  except it was all made out of metal  stacks and stacks of cogs     cogs high. Imagine a thing this high of cogs  hundreds and hundreds of them  and they've got numbers on them. It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal. And he thought about using binary. The problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall  it would have been ridiculous. As it is  it's enormous. So he's got memory. The memory is this bit over here. You see it all like this. This monstrosity over here is the CPU  the chip  if you like. Of course  it's this big. Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical. This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU which is in the Science Museum. The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic    so addition  multiplication  subtraction  division    which already is a bit of a feat in metal  but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn't  this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision. It could do the  if then  for basic programmers  and that fundamentally made it into a computer. It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more. Now  if we look at this  and we stop for a minute  and we think about chips today  we can't look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny. Yet if you did  you would see something very  very similar to this. There's this incredible complexity in the CPU  and this incredible regularity in the memory. If you've ever seen an electron microscope picture  you'll see this. This all looks the same  then there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated. All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does  but of course you need to program this thing  and of course  Babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the '  s  '  s and '  s  which is punch cards. This thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here  and this is a program in the Science Museum  just not far from here  created by Charles Babbage  that is sitting there   you can go see it   waiting for the machine to be built. And there's not just one of these  there's many of them. He prepared programs anticipating this would happen. Now  the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard  in France  had created the Jacquard loom  which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards  so he was just repurposing the technology of the day  and like everything else he did  he's using the technology of his era  so     s      s      s  cogs  steam  mechanical devices. Ironically  born the same year as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday  who would completely revolutionize everything with the dynamo  transformers  all these sorts of things. Babbage  of course  wanted to use proven technology  so steam and things. Now  he needed accessories. Obviously  you've got a computer now. You've got punch cards  a CPU and memory. You need accessories you're going to come with. You're not just going to have that  So  first of all  you had sound. You had a bell  so if anything went wrong    Laughter    or the machine needed the attendant to come to it  there was a bell it could ring.  Laughter  And there's actually an instruction on the punch card which says  Ring the bell.  So you can imagine this  Ting   You know  just stop for a moment  imagine all those noises  this thing   Click  clack click click click   steam engine   Ding   right   Laughter  You also need a printer  obviously  and everyone needs a printer. This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his  called the Difference Engine No.    which he never built  but which the Science Museum did build in the '  s and '  s. It's completely mechanical  again  a printer. It prints just numbers  because he was obsessed with numbers  but it does print onto paper  and it even does word wrapping  so if you get to the end of the line  it goes around like that. You also need graphics  right  I mean  if you're going to do anything with graphics  so he said   Well  I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and I'll make it plot.  So he designed a plotter as well  and  you know  at that point  I think he got pretty much a pretty good machine. Along comes this woman  Ada Lovelace. Now  imagine these soirees  all these great and good comes along. This lady is the daughter of the mad  bad and dangerous to know Lord Byron  and her mother  being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness  thought   I know the solution  Mathematics is the solution. We'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down.  there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy  so  you know  that'll be fine.  Laughter  Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training  and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother  and Charles Babbage  you know  gets out his machine. The Duke of Wellington is there  you know  get out the machine  obviously demonstrates it  and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime  really  who said   I understand what this does  and I understand the future of this machine.  And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build because of her. Now  some people call her the first programmer. This is actually from one of    the paper that she translated. This is a program written in a particular style. It's not  historically  totally accurate that she's the first programmer  and actually  she did something more amazing. Rather than just being a programmer  she saw something that Babbage didn't. Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics. He was building a machine to do mathematics  and Lovelace said   You could do more than mathematics on this machine.  And just as you do  everyone in this room already's got a computer on them right now  because they've got a phone. If you go into that phone  every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom. Whether it's video or text or music or voice  it's all numbers  it's all  underlying it  mathematical functions happening  and Lovelace said   Just because you're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn't mean these things can't represent other things in the real world  such as music.  This was a huge leap  because Babbage is there saying   We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs      Laughter    and Lovelace is there and she says   Look  this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically.  So this is what I call Lovelace's Leap. When you say she's a programmer  she did do some  but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much  much more than this. Now  a hundred years later  this guy comes along  Alan Turing  and in       and invents the computer all over again. Now  of course  Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical. Turing's machine was entirely theoretical. Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective  but Turing told us something very important. He laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science  and said   It doesn't matter how you make a computer.  It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical  like Babbage's was  or electronic  like computers are today  or perhaps in the future  cells  or  again  mechanical again  once we get into nanotechnology. We could go back to Babbage's machine and just make it tiny. All those things are computers. There is in a sense a computing essence. This is called the Church Turing thesis. And so suddenly  you get this link where you say this thing Babbage had built really was a computer. In fact  it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers  only really slowly.  Laughter  To give you an idea of how slowly  it had about  k of memory. It used punch cards  which were being fed in  and it ran about        times slower the first ZX  . It did have a RAM pack. You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to. So there are plans. Over in Swindon  the Science Museum archives  there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine. One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan     and that is also the name of a charity that I started with Doron Swade  who was the curator of computing at the Science Museum  and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine  and our plan is to build it. Here in South Kensington  we will build the analytical engine. The project has a number of parts to it. One was the scanning of Babbage's archive. That's been done. The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build. The third part is a computer simulation of that machine  and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum. When it's built  you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works  because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you  you've got to look at this humongous thing and say   Ah  I see the memory operating  I see the CPU operating  I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating.   Laughter  But in between that we're going to do a simulation. Babbage himself wrote  he said  as soon as the analytical engine exists  it will surely guide the future course of science. Of course  he never built it  because he was always fiddling with new plans  but when it did get built  of course  in the     s  everything changed. Now  I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the CPU mechanism working. So this is just three sets of cogs  and it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism in action  so you imagine this gigantic machine. So  give me five years. Before the     s happen  we'll have it. Thank you very much.  Applause \n",
      "The Internet  the Web as we know it  the kind of Web    the things we're all talking about    is already less than       days old. So all of the things that we've seen come about  starting  say  with satellite images of the whole Earth  which we couldn't even imagine happening before  all these things rolling into our lives  just this abundance of things that are right before us  sitting in front of our laptop  or our desktop. This kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and never ending is amazing  and we're not amazed. It's really amazing that all this stuff is here. It's in       days  all this stuff has come. And I know that    years ago  if I had told you that this was all coming  you would have said that that's impossible. There's simply no economic model that that would be possible. And if I told you it was all coming for free  you would say  this is simply    you're dreaming. You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild eyed optimist. And yet it's here. The other thing that we know about it was that    years ago  as I looked at what even Wired was talking about  we thought it was going to be TV  but better. That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming. And it turns out that that's not what it was. First of all  it was impossible  and it's not what it was. And so one of the things that I think we're learning    if you think about  like  Wikipedia  it's something that was simply impossible. It's impossible in theory  but possible in practice. And if you take all these things that are impossible  I think one of the things that we're learning from this era  from this last decade  is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible  because we're unprepared for it. So  I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next       days. But if that's happened in the last       days  what's going to happen in the next       days  So  I have a kind of a simple story  and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making  this thing that has happened in       days    that's all these computers  all these handhelds  all these cell phones  all these laptops  all these servers    basically what we're getting out of all these connections is we're getting one machine. If there is only one machine  and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines  but that we're basically constructing a single  global machine. And so I began to think about that. And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we've ever made. It has not crashed  it's running uninterrupted. And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made that runs the number of hours  the number of days.       days without interruption    that's just unbelievable. And of course  the Internet is longer than just       days  the Web is only       days. So  I was trying to basically make measurements. What are the dimensions of this machine  And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe on all the computers. And there is a     billion clicks per day. And there's    trillion links between all the Web pages of the world. And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions  and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan  the photographer  talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless  Well  here's a list of them. They're hard to tell  but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet  if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet. There's two million emails per second. So it's a very big number. It's just a huge machine  and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet. So here's the specifications  just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it      quadrillion transistors     trillion links  emails running at two megahertz itself     kilohertz text messaging      exabyte storage. That's a big disk. That's a lot of storage  memory. Nine exabyte RAM. And the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second. Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes. So every second  half of the Library of Congress is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine. So I did something else. I figured out     billion clicks per day     trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain. A quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain. So to a first approximation  we have these things    twenty petahertz synapse firings. Of course  the memory is really huge. But to a first approximation  the size of this machine is the size    and its complexity  kind of    to your brain. Because in fact  that's how your brain works    in kind of the same way that the Web works. However  your brain isn't doubling every two years. So if we say this machine right now that we've made is about one HB  one human brain  if we look at the rate that this is increasing     years from now  there'll be six billion HBs. So by the year       the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity  in raw bits and stuff. And this is  I think  where Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross. So  what about that  Well  here's a couple of things. I have three kind of general things I would like to say  three consequences of this. First  that basically what this machine is doing is embodying. We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do in the next       days    we're going to give this machine a body. And the second thing is  we're going to restructure its architecture. And thirdly  we're going to become completely codependent upon it. So let me go through those three things. First of all  we have all these things in our hands. We think they're all separate devices  but in fact  every screen in the world is looking into the one machine. These are all basically portals into that one machine. The second thing is that    some people call this the cloud  and you're kind of touching the cloud with this. And so in some ways  all you really need is a cloudbook. And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage. It's wireless. It's always connected. There's many things about it. It becomes very simple  and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine  you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way. So the machine is computing. And in some ways  it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing. But everything  all the cameras  and the microphones  and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine. And everything will go through the Web. And we're seeing that already with  say  phones. Right now  phones don't go through the Web  but they are beginning to  and they will. And if you imagine what  say  just as an example  what Google Labs has in terms of experiments with Google Docs  Google Spreadsheets  blah  blah  blah    all these things are going to become Web based. They're going through the machine. And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web. Right now  it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work  a Word document  they aren't on the Web  but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine. They're going to speak the Web language. They're going to talk to the machine. The Web  in some sense  is kind of like a black hole that's sucking up everything into it. And so every thing will be part of the Web. So every item  every artifact that we make  will have embedded in it some little sliver of Web ness and connection  and it will be part of this machine  so that our environment    kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense    our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected. Now  with RFIDs and other things    whatever technology it is  it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine  and so we have  basically  an Internet of things. So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels  and a car as a chip with wheels  because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it  and not the materials. A lot of people think about the new economy as something that was going to be a disembodied  alternative  virtual existence  and that we would have the old economy of atoms. But in fact  what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two  where we embed the information  and the digital nature of things into the material world. That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going    this union  this convergence of the atomic and the digital. And so one of the consequences of that  I believe  is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now    TV  film  video    that basically becomes one media platform. And while there's many differences in some senses  they will share more and more in common with each other. So that the laws of media  such as the fact that copies have no value  the value's in the uncopiable things  the immediacy  the authentication  the personalization. The media wants to be liquid. The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them  not so that they are  free  as in  beer   but  free  as in  freedom.  And the network effects rule  meaning that the more you have  the more you get. The first fax machine    the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot  because there was nobody to fax to. But here she became an evangelist  recruiting others to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable. Those are the effects that we're going to see. Attention is the currency. So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media. And the other thing about this embodiment is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal. McLuhan was saying   Machines are the extensions of the human senses.  And I'm saying   Humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine   in a certain sense. So we have a trillion eyes  and ears  and touches  through all our digital photographs and cameras. And we see that in things like Flickr  or Photosynth  this program from Microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it. In a certain sense  the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras. Now  the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring  that what the Web is doing is restructuring. And I have to warn you  that what we'll talk about is    I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing  which is a  semantic Web.  So first of all  the first stage that we've seen of the Internet was that it was going to link computers. And that's what we called the Net  that was the Internet of nets. And we saw that  where you have all the computers of the world. And if you remember  it was a kind of green screen with cursors  and there was really not much to do  and if you wanted to connect it  you connected it from one computer to another computer. And what you had to do was    if you wanted to participate in this  you had to share packets of information. So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control. It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line  you had to share packets. The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages. So in the old one  if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page  I went from my computer  to an FTP site  to another airline computer. Now we have pages    the unit has been resolved into pages  so one page links to another page. And if I want to go in to book a flight  I go into the airline's flight page  the website of the airline  and I'm linking to that page. And what we're sharing were links  so you had to be kind of open with links. You couldn't deny    if someone wanted to link to you  you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody. So that's what we were doing. We're now entering to the third stage  which is what I'm talking about  and that is where we link the data. So  I don't know what the name of this thing is. I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data. So we're going from machine to machine  from page to page  and now data to data. So the difference is  is that rather than linking from page to page  we're actually going to link from one idea on a page to another idea  rather than to the other page. So every idea is basically being supported    or every item  or every noun    is being supported by the entire Web. It's being resolved at the level of items  or ideas  or words  if you want. So besides physically coming out again into this idea that it's not just virtual  it's actually going out to things. So something will resolve down to the information about a particular person  so every person will have a unique ID. Every person  every item will have a something that will be very specific  and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item. So now  in this new one  when I link to it  I would link to my particular flight  my particular seat. And so  giving an example of this thing  I live in Pacifica  rather than    right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere. The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town  and that it's a specific town that I live in  but that's what we're going to be talking about. It's going to link directly to    it will know  the Web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place  and that whenever it sees that word   Pacifica   it knows that it actually has a place  latitude  longitude  a certain population. So here are some of the technical terms  all three letter things  that you'll see a lot more of. All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data. So I'll give you one kind of an example. There's like a billion social sites on the Web. Each time you go into there  you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are. Why should you be doing that  You should just do that once  and it should know who all your friends are. So that's what you want  is all your friends are identified  and you should just carry these relationships around. All this data about you should just be conveyed  and you should do it once and that's all that should happen. And you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data. That's what we're moving into    where it sort of knows these things down to that level. A semantic Web  Web  .   giant global graph    we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing. But what's it's doing is sharing data. So you have to be open to having your data shared  which is a much bigger step than just sharing your Web page  or your computer. And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages  they are things. Everything we've described  every artifact or place  will be a specific representation  will have a specific character that can be linked to directly. So we have this database of things. And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to  that we won't see in the next    years  or       days  but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things    where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane    that that physical thing becomes part of the Web. And so we are in the middle of this thing that's completely linked  down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has. So  the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent. It's always going to be there  and the closer it is  the better. If you allow Google to  it will tell you your search history. And I found out by looking at it that I search most at    o'clock in the morning. So I am open  and being transparent to that. And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency. That is going to be the price. If you want to have total personalization  you have to be totally transparent. Google. I can't remember my phone number  I'll just ask Google. We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point where I don't even try to remember things    I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that. And we kind of object at first  saying   Oh  that's awful.  But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology  called the alphabet  and writing  we're totally dependent on it  and it's transformed culture. We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing. And so in the same way  we're going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there. And what is happening with this is some kind of AI  but it's not the AI in conscious AI  as being an expert  Larry Page told me that that's what they're trying to do  and that's what they're trying to do. But when six billion humans are Googling  who's searching who  It goes both ways. So we are the Web  that's what this thing is. We are going to be the machine. So the next       days  it's not going to be the Web and only better. Just like it wasn't TV and only better. The next       days  it's not just going to be the Web but only better    it's going to be something different. And I think it's going to be smarter. It'll have an intelligence in there  that's not  again  conscious. But it'll anticipate what we're doing  in a good sense. Secondly  it's become much more personalized. It will know us  and that's good. And again  the price of that will be transparency. And thirdly  it's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment  and we will be in the middle of it. And all these devices will be portals into that. So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just  the Web  only better   but a new kind of stage in this development. It looks more global. If you take this whole thing  it is a very big machine  very reliable machine  more reliable than its parts. But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism. So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system  more as if this wasn't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with. It's a  One.  And I don't know what else to call it  than the One. We'll have a better word for it. But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge. And again  I don't want to talk about consciousness  I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria  or a volvox  which is what that organism is. So  to do  action  take away. So  here's what I would say  there's only one machine  and the Web is its OS. All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web. To share is to gain. Let the One read it. It's going to be machine readable. You want to make something that the machine can read. And the One is us. We are in the One. I appreciate your time.\n",
      "Last year  I told you the story  in seven minutes  of Project Orion  which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked  but it had this one year political window where it could have happened. So it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen. This year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing. This was a perfect introduction. And it's a story that did work. It did happen  and the machines are all around us. And it was a technology that was inevitable. If the people I'm going to tell you the story about  if they hadn't done it  somebody else would have. So  it was sort of the right idea at the right time. This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now. It's the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things  including changing biology. I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity  which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED  it brought a whole lot of very smart people together. And three of the smartest people were Stan Ulam  Richard Feynman and John von Neumann. And it was Von Neumann who said  after the bomb  he was working on something much more important than bombs  he's thinking about computers. So  he wasn't only thinking about them  he built one. This is the machine he built. He built this machine  and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works  with these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back. The first person to really explain that was Thomas Hobbes  who  in       explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing  and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic  you can do it all with arithmetic. He said you needed addition and subtraction. Leibniz  who came a little bit later    this is         showed that you didn't even need subtraction. You could do the whole thing with addition. Here  we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution. And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine. He talked about doing it with marbles  having gates and what we now call shift registers  where you shift the gates  drop the marbles down the tracks. And that's what all these machines are doing  except  instead of doing it with marbles  they're doing it with electrons. And then we jump to Von Neumann        when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing. And       after the war  the electronics existed to actually try and build such a machine. So June         actually  the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet    and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing  which also goes back to Turing  who  before that  gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless  little  finite state machine  just reading a tape in and reading a tape out. The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather. Lewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people  giving them each a little chunk  and putting it together. Here  we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will  but capable of only two ideas. And that's really the simplest computer. It's basically why you need the qubit  because it only has two ideas. And you put lots of those together  you get the essentials of the modern computer  the arithmetic unit  the central control  the memory  the recording medium  the input and the output. But  there's one catch. This is the fatal    you know  we saw it in starting these programs up. The instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail. So  the programming has to be perfect  or it won't work. If you look at the origins of this  the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here. But actually  the machine I'm going to tell you about  the Institute for Advanced Study machine  which is way up there  really should be down there. So  I'm trying to revise history  and give some of these guys more credit than they've had. Such a computer would open up universes  which are  at the present  outside the range of any instruments. So it opens up a whole new world  and these people saw it. The guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle  Vladimir Zworykin  from RCA. RCA  in probably one of the lousiest business decisions of all time  decided not to go into computers. But the first meetings  November       were at RCA's offices. RCA started this whole thing off  and said  you know  televisions are the future  not computers. The essentials were all there    all the things that make these machines run. Von Neumann  and a logician  and a mathematician from the army put this together. Then  they needed a place to build it. When RCA said no  that's when they decided to build it in Princeton  where Freeman works at the Institute. That's where I grew up as a kid. That's me  that's my sister Esther  who's talked to you before  so we both go back to the birth of this thing. That's Freeman  a long time ago  and that was me. And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern  who wrote the  Theory of Games.  All these forces came together there  in Princeton. Oppenheimer  who had built the bomb. The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations. And Julian Bigelow  who took Zworkykin's place as the engineer  to actually figure out  using electronics  how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this  and women in front  who actually did most of the coding  were the first programmers. These were the prototype geeks  the nerds. They didn't fit in at the Institute. This is a letter from the director  concerned about     especially unfair on the matter of sugar.  You can read the text. This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time. These were not theoretical physicists. They were real soldering gun type guys  and they actually built this thing. And we take it for granted now  that each of these machines has billions of transistors  doing billions of cycles per second without failing. They were using vacuum tubes  very narrow  sloppy techniques to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes. They actually used  J   the common radio tube  because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes. And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way. Reports were issued  so that this machine was cloned at    other places around the world. And it really was. It was the original microprocessor. All the computers now are copies of that machine. The memory was in cathode ray tubes    a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube    very  very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances. So  there's    of these tubes  like a V    engine running the memory. The input and the output was by teletype tape at first. This is a wire drive  using bicycle wheels. This is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now. Then they switched to a magnetic drum. This is modifying IBM equipment  which is the origins of the whole data processing industry  later at IBM. And this is the beginning of computer graphics. The  Graph'g Beam Turn On.  This next slide  that's the    as far as I know    the first digital bitmap display      . So  Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud  doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components. Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it were writing in their logbooks  trying to get this thing to work  with all these       vacuum tubes that failed half the time. And that's what I've been doing  this last six months  is going through the logs.  Running time  two minutes. Input  output     minutes.  This includes a large amount of human error. So they are always trying to figure out  what's machine error  What's human error  What's code  what's hardware  That's an engineer gazing at tube number     trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus. He had to focus the memory    seems OK. So  he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running  let alone having  you know  software problems.  No use  went home.   Laughter   Impossible to follow the damn thing  where's a directory   So  already  they're complaining about the manuals   before closing down in disgust ...    The General Arithmetic  Operating Logs.  Burning lots of midnight oil.  MANIAC   which became the acronym for the machine  Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator   lost its memory.   MANIAC regained its memory  when the power went off.   Machine or human    Aha   So  they figured out it's a code problem.  Found trouble in code  I hope.   Code error  machine not guilty.   Damn it  I can be just as stubborn as this thing.   And the dawn came.  So they ran all night. Twenty four hours a day  this thing was running  mainly running bomb calculations.  Everything up to this point is wasted time.   What's the use  Good night.   Master control off. The hell with it. Way off.   Laughter   Something's wrong with the air conditioner    smell of burning V belts in the air.   A short    do not turn the machine on.   IBM machine putting a tar like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof.  So they really were working under tough conditions. Here   A mouse has climbed into the blower behind the regulator rack  set blower to vibrating. Result  no more mouse.   Here lies mouse. Born   . Died       a.m.  May     .  There's an inside joke someone has penciled in   Here lies Marston Mouse.  If you're a mathematician  you get that  because Marston was a mathematician who objected to the computer being there.  Picked a lightning bug off the drum.   Running at two kilocycles.  That's two thousand cycles per second     yes  I'm chicken     so two kilocycles was slow speed. The high speed was    kilocycles. I don't know if you remember a Mac that was    Megahertz  that's slow speed.  I have now duplicated both results. How will I know which is right  assuming one result is correct  This now is the third different output. I know when I'm licked.   We've duplicated errors before.   Machine run  fine. Code isn't.   Only happens when the machine is running.  And sometimes things are okay.  Machine a thing of beauty  and a joy forever.   Perfect running.   Parting thought  when there's bigger and better errors  we'll have them.  So  nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs. They're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook  late one night  finally drew a bomb. So  that was the result. It was Mike  the first thermonuclear bomb  in     . That was designed on that machine  in the woods behind the Institute. So Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos from all over the world to work on all these problems. Barricelli  he came to do what we now call  really  artificial life  trying to see if  in this artificial universe    he was a viral geneticist  way  way  way ahead of his time. He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now. Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer. Began    his universe started March    '  . So it's almost exactly    it's    years ago next Tuesday  I guess. And he saw everything in terms of    he could read the binary code straight off the machine. He had a wonderful rapport. Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him. Even errors were duplicated.  Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong  code is right.  So he designed this universe  and ran it. When the bomb people went home  he was allowed in there. He would run that thing all night long  running these things  if anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram  who reinvented this stuff. And he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared. It was published in the literature.  If it's that easy to create living organisms  why not create a few yourself   So  he decided to give it a try  to start this artificial biology going in the machines. And he found all these  sort of    it was like a naturalist coming in and looking at this tiny        byte universe  and seeing all these things happening that we see in the outside world  in biology. This is some of the generations of his universe. But they're just going to stay numbers  they're not going to become organisms. They have to have something. You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype. They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that  started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with    playing chess with other machines and so on. And they did start to evolve. And he went around the country after that. Every time there was a new  fast machine  he started using it  and saw exactly what's happening now. That the programs  instead of being turned off    when you quit the program  you'd keep running and  basically  all the sorts of things like Windows is doing  running as a multi cellular organism on many machines  he envisioned all that happening. And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process. It wasn't any sort of creator intelligence  but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence. And he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lifelike  or a new kind of life. It just was another version of the same thing happening. And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago. And could you do it again now  So  when I went into these archives looking at this stuff  lo and behold  the archivist came up one day  saying   I think we found another box that had been thrown out.  And it was his universe on punch cards. So there it is     years later  sitting there    sort of suspended animation. That's the instructions for running    this is actually the source code for one of those universes  with a note from the engineers saying they're having some problems.  There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet.  And I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity. What's the dividing line between when that is lifelike and when it really is alive  These cards  now  thanks to me showing up  are being saved. And the question is  should we run them or not  You know  could we get them running  Do you want to let it loose on the Internet  These machines would think they    these organisms  if they came back to life now    whether they've died and gone to heaven  there's a universe. My laptop is    thousand million times the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project. He was thinking far ahead  to how this would really grow into a new kind of life. And that's what's happening  When Juan Enriquez told us about these    trillion bits being transferred back and forth  of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab  that's what Barricelli imagined  that this digital code in these machines is actually starting to code    it already is coding from nucleic acids. We've been doing that since  you know  since we started PCR and synthesizing small strings of DNA. And real soon  we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins  and  like Steve showed us  that just opens an entirely new world. It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned. This was published after he died  his sort of unfinished notes on self reproducing machines  what it takes to get the machines sort of jump started to where they begin to reproduce. It took really three people  Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing  Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines    that now  last count  four million of these Von Neumann machines is built every    hours  and Julian Bigelow  who died    days ago    this is John Markoff's obituary for him    he was the important missing link  the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work. And all our computers have  inside them  the copies of the architecture that he had to just design one day  sort of on pencil and paper. And we owe a tremendous credit to that. And he explained  in a very generous way  the spirit that brought all these different people to the Institute for Advanced Study in the '  s to do this project  and make it freely available with no patents  no restrictions  no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world. That's the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down  July     . And it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off. And that's the end. Thank you very much.\n",
      "I'm going to talk to you today about the design of medical technology for low resource settings. I study health systems in these countries. And one of the major gaps in care  almost across the board  is access to safe surgery. Now one of the major bottlenecks that we've found that's sort of preventing both the access in the first place and the safety of those surgeries that do happen is anesthesia. And actually  it's the model that we expect to work for delivering anesthesia in these environments. Here we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the U.S. or any other developed country. In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine. And this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives because it was designed with this environment in mind. In order to operate  this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer. It needs an extremely well trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery. It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms  and it needs special care  TLC  to keep it up and running  and it's going to break pretty easily. And when it does  it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities  can fix it  can source the parts and keep it saving lives. It's a pretty expensive machine. It needs a hospital whose budget can allow it to support one machine costing upwards of    or         . And perhaps most obviously  and perhaps most importantly    and the path to concepts that we've heard about kind of illustrate this    it needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity  of compressed oxygen and other medical supplies that are so critical to the functioning of this machine. In other words  this machine requires a lot of stuff that this hospital cannot offer. This is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural Malawi. In this hospital  there is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia  and she's qualified because she has     maybe    months of training in anesthesia. In the hospital and in the entire region there's not a single biomedical engineer. So when this machine breaks  the machines they have to work with break  they've got to try and figure it out  but most of the time  that's the end of the road. Those machines go the proverbial junkyard. And the price tag of the machine that I mentioned could represent maybe a quarter or a third of the annual operating budget for this hospital. And finally  I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong. This hospital is connected to a very weak power grid  one that goes down frequently. So it runs frequently  the entire hospital  just on a generator. And you can imagine  the generator breaks down or runs out of fuel. And the World Bank sees this and estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low income country can expect up to    power outages per month. Similarly compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months or even a year. So it seems crazy  but the model that we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that I showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment. It's not just inappropriate  it becomes really unsafe. One of our partners at Johns Hopkins was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone about a year ago. And the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case. A woman came in  she needed an emergency C section to save her life and the life of her baby. And everything began pretty auspiciously. The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in. The nurse was there. She was able to anesthetize her quickly  and it was important because of the emergency nature of the situation. And everything began well until the power went out. And now in the middle of this surgery  the surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case  which he can do    he's got a headlamp. But the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater trying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient  to keep her patient asleep. Because her machine doesn't work when there's no power. And now this routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced  and others are probably the product of  has now become a tragedy. And what's so frustrating is this is not a singular event  this happens across the developing world.    million surgeries are attempted every year without safe anesthesia. My colleague  Dr. Paul Fenton  was living this reality. He was the chief of anesthesiology in a hospital in Malawi  a teaching hospital. He went to work every day in an operating theater like this one  trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable  and frankly unsafe  in his hospital. And after umpteen surgeries and  you can imagine  really unspeakable tragedy  he just said   That's it. I'm done. That's enough. There has to be something better.  So he took a walk down the hall to where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them    I think that's the scientific term    and he just started tinkering. He took one part from here and another from there  and he tried to come up with a machine that would work in the reality that he was facing. And what he came up with was this guy  the prototype for the Universal Anesthesia Machine    a machine that would work and anesthetize his patients no matter the circumstances that his hospital had to offer. Here it is back at home at that same hospital  developed a little further     years later  working on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics. Now let me show you a little bit about how this machine works. Voila  Here she is. When you have electricity  everything in this machine begins in the base. There's a built in oxygen concentrator down there. Now you've heard me mention oxygen a few times at this point. Essentially  to deliver anesthesia  you want as pure oxygen as possible  because eventually you're going to dilute it essentially with the gas. And the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous. But so in here when there's electricity  the oxygen concentrator takes in room air. Now we know room air is gloriously free  it is abundant  and it's already    percent oxygen. So all this concentrator does is take that room air in  filter it and send    percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent. Now before that mixture hits the patient's lungs  it's going to pass by here    you can't see it  but there's an oxygen sensor here    that's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered. Now if you don't have power  or  God forbid  the power cuts out in the middle of surgery  this machine transitions automatically  without even having to touch it  to drawing in room air from this inlet. Everything else is the same. The only difference is that now you're only working with    percent oxygen. Now that used to be a dangerous guessing game  because you only knew if you had given too little oxygen once something bad happened. But we've put a long life battery backup on here. This is the only part that's battery backed up. But this gives control to the provider  whether there's power or not  because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving their patient. In both cases  whether you have power or not  sometimes the patient needs help breathing. It's just a reality of anesthesia. The lungs can be paralyzed. And so we've just added this manual bellows. We've seen surgeries for three or four hours to ventilate the patient on this. So it's a straightforward machine. I shudder to say simple  it's straightforward. And it's by design. And you do not need to be a highly trained  specialized anesthesiologist to use this machine  which is good because  in these rural district hospitals  you're not going to get that level of training. It's also designed for the environment that it will be used in. This is an incredibly rugged machine. It has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts. And so it's not going to break very easily  but if it does  virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver. And finally  it's affordable. This machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier. So in other words  what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery and save lives because it was designed for its environment  just like the first machine I showed you. But we're not content to stop there. Is it working  Is this the design that's going to work in place  Well we've seen good results so far. This is in    hospitals in four countries  and since       we've done well over       surgeries with no clinically adverse events. So we're thrilled. This really seems like a cost effective  scalable solution to a problem that's really pervasive. But we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals. So to do that we've launched a number of partnerships with NGOs and universities to gather data on the user interface  on the types of surgeries it's appropriate for and ways we can enhance the device itself. One of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins just here in Baltimore. They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore. So we're taking this machine and recreating some of the operating theater crises that this machine might face in one of the hospitals that it's intended for  and in a contained  safe environment  evaluating its effectiveness. We're then able to compare the results from that study with real world experience  because we're putting two of these in hospitals that Johns Hopkins works with in Sierra Leone  including the hospital where that emergency C section happened. So I've talked a lot about anesthesia  and I tend to do that. I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health. And it really seems peripheral  we never think about it  until we don't have access to it  and then it becomes a gatekeeper. Who gets surgery and who doesn't  Who gets safe surgery and who doesn't  But you know  it's just one of so many ways that design  appropriate design  can have an impact on health outcomes. If more people in the health delivery space really working on some of these challenges in low income countries could start their design process  their solution search  from outside of that proverbial box and inside of the hospital    in other words  if we could design for the environment that exists in so many parts of the world  rather than the one that we wished existed    we might just save a lot of lives. Thank you very much.\n",
      "It used to be that if you wanted to get a computer to do something new  you would have to program it. Now  programming  for those of you here that haven't done it yourself  requires laying out in excruciating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal. Now  if you want to do something that you don't know how to do yourself  then this is going to be a great challenge. So this was the challenge faced by this man  Arthur Samuel. In       he wanted to get this computer to be able to beat him at checkers. How can you write a program  lay out in excruciating detail  how to be better than you at checkers  So he came up with an idea  he had the computer play against itself thousands of times and learn how to play checkers. And indeed it worked  and in fact  by       this computer had beaten the Connecticut state champion. So Arthur Samuel was the father of machine learning  and I have a great debt to him  because I am a machine learning practitioner. I was the president of Kaggle  a community of over         machine learning practictioners. Kaggle puts up competitions to try and get them to solve previously unsolved problems  and it's been successful  hundreds of times. So from this vantage point  I was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past  can do today  and what it could do in the future. Perhaps the first big success of  machine learning commercially was Google. Google showed that it is possible to find information by using a computer algorithm  and this algorithm is based on machine learning. Since that time  there have been many commercial successes of machine learning. Companies like Amazon and Netflix use machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy  movies that you might like to watch. Sometimes  it's almost creepy. Companies like LinkedIn and Facebook sometimes will tell you about who your friends might be and you have no idea how it did it  and this is because it's using the power of machine learning. These are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data rather than being programmed by hand. This is also how IBM was successful in getting Watson to beat the two world champions at  Jeopardy   answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one.   The ancient 'Lion of Nimrud' went missing from this city's national museum in        along with a lot of other stuff    This is also why we are now able to see the first self driving cars. If you want to be able to tell the difference between  say  a tree and a pedestrian  well  that's pretty important. We don't know how to write those programs by hand  but with machine learning  this is now possible. And in fact  this car has driven  over a million miles without any accidents on regular roads. So we now know that computers can learn  and computers can learn to do things that we actually sometimes don't know how to do ourselves  or maybe can do them better than us. One of the most amazing examples I've seen of machine learning happened on a project that I ran at Kaggle where a team run by a guy called Geoffrey Hinton from the University of Toronto won a competition for automatic drug discovery. Now  what was extraordinary here is not just that they beat all of the algorithms developed by Merck or the international academic community  but nobody on the team had any background in chemistry or biology or life sciences  and they did it in two weeks. How did they do this  They used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning. So important was this that in fact the success was covered in The New York Times in a front page article a few weeks later. This is Geoffrey Hinton here on the left hand side. Deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works  and as a result it's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do. The more data you give it and the more computation time you give it  the better it gets. The New York Times also showed in this article another extraordinary result of deep learning which I'm going to show you now. It shows that computers  can listen and understand. that I want to be able to take in this process is to actually speak to you in Chinese. Now the key thing there is  we've been able to take a large amount  of information from many Chinese speakers and produce a text to speech system that takes Chinese text and converts it into Chinese language  and then we've taken an hour or so of my own voice and we've used that to modulate the standard text to speech system so that it would sound like me. Again  the result's not perfect. There are in fact quite a few errors. There's much work to be done in this area. Jeremy Howard  Well  that was at a machine learning conference in China. It's not often  actually  at academic conferences that you do hear spontaneous applause  although of course sometimes at TEDx conferences  feel free. Everything you saw there was happening with deep learning. The transcription in English was deep learning. The translation to Chinese and the text in the top right  deep learning  and the construction of the voice was deep learning as well. So deep learning is this extraordinary thing. It's a single algorithm that can seem to do almost anything  and I discovered that a year earlier  it had also learned to see. In this obscure competition from Germany called the German Traffic Sign  Recognition Benchmark  deep learning had learned to recognize traffic signs like this one. Not only could it recognize the traffic signs better than any other algorithm  the leaderboard actually showed it was better than people  about twice as good as people. So by       we had the first example of computers that can see better than people. Since that time  a lot has happened. In       Google announced that they had a deep learning algorithm watch YouTube videos and crunched the data on        computers for a month  and the computer independently learned about concepts such as people and cats just by watching the videos. This is much like the way that humans learn. Humans don't learn by being told what they see  but by learning for themselves what these things are. Also in       Geoffrey Hinton  who we saw earlier  won the very popular ImageNet competition  looking to try to figure out  from one and a half million images what they're pictures of. As of       we're now down to a six percent error rate in image recognition. This is better than people  again. So machines really are doing an extraordinarily good job of this  and it is now being used in industry. For example  Google announced last year that they had mapped every single location in France in two hours  and the way they did it was that they fed street view images into a deep learning algorithm to recognize and read street numbers. Imagine how long it would have taken before  dozens of people  many years. This is also happening in China. Baidu is kind of  the Chinese Google  I guess  and what you see here in the top left is an example of a picture that I uploaded to Baidu's deep learning system  and underneath you can see that the system has understood what that picture is and found similar images. The similar images actually have similar backgrounds  similar directions of the faces  even some with their tongue out. This is not clearly looking at the text of a web page. All I uploaded was an image. So we now have computers which really understand what they see and can therefore search databases of hundreds of millions of images in real time. So what does it mean now that computers can see  Well  it's not just  that computers can see. In fact  deep learning has done more than that. Complex  nuanced sentences like this one are now understandable with deep learning algorithms. As you can see here  this Stanford based system showing the red dot at the top has figured out that this sentence is expressing negative sentiment. Deep learning now in fact is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things. Also  deep learning has been used to read Chinese  again at about native Chinese speaker level. This algorithm developed out of Switzerland by people  none of whom speak or understand any Chinese. As I say  using deep learning is about the best system in the world for this  even compared to native human understanding. This is a system that we put together at my company which shows putting all this stuff together. These are pictures which have no text attached  and as I'm typing in here sentences  in real time it's understanding these pictures and figuring out what they're about and finding pictures that are similar to the text that I'm writing. So you can see  it's actually understanding my sentences and actually understanding these pictures. I know that you've seen something like this on Google  where you can type in things and it will show you pictures  but actually what it's doing is it's searching the webpage for the text. This is very different from actually understanding the images. This is something that computers have only been able to do for the first time in the last few months. So we can see now that computers can not only see but they can also read  and  of course  we've shown that they can understand what they hear. Perhaps not surprising now that I'm going to tell you they can write. Here is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday. And here is some text that an algorithm out of Stanford generated. Each of these sentences was generated by a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures. This algorithm before has never seen a man in a black shirt playing a guitar. It's seen a man before  it's seen black before  it's seen a guitar before  but it has independently generated this novel description of this picture. We're still not quite at human performance here  but we're close. In tests  humans prefer the computer generated caption one out of four times. Now this system is now only two weeks old  so probably within the next year  the computer algorithm will be well past human performance at the rate things are going. So computers can also write. So we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities. For example  in medicine  a team in Boston announced that they had discovered dozens of new clinically relevant features of tumors which help doctors make a prognosis of a cancer. Very similarly  in Stanford  a group there announced that  looking at tissues under magnification  they've developed  a machine learning based system which in fact is better than human pathologists at predicting survival rates for cancer sufferers. In both of these cases  not only were the predictions more accurate  but they generated new insightful science. In the radiology case  they were new clinical indicators that humans can understand. In this pathology case  the computer system actually discovered that the cells around the cancer are as important as the cancer cells themselves in making a diagnosis. This is the opposite of what pathologists had been taught for decades. In each of those two cases  they were systems developed by a combination of medical experts and machine learning experts  but as of last year  we're now beyond that too. This is an example of identifying cancerous areas of human tissue under a microscope. The system being shown here can identify those areas more accurately  or about as accurately  as human pathologists  but was built entirely with deep learning using no medical expertise by people who have no background in the field. Similarly  here  this neuron segmentation. We can now segment neurons about as accurately as humans can  but this system was developed with deep learning using people with no previous  background in medicine. So myself  as somebody with no previous background in medicine  I seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company  which I did. I was kind of terrified of doing it  but the theory seemed to suggest that it ought to be possible to do very useful medicine using just these data analytic techniques. And thankfully  the feedback has been fantastic  not just from the media but from the medical community  who have been very supportive. The theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysis as much as possible  leaving doctors to do what they're best at. I want to give you an example. It now takes us about    minutes to generate a new medical diagnostic test and I'll show you that in real time now  but I've compressed it down to  three minutes by cutting some pieces out. Rather than showing you creating a medical diagnostic test  I'm going to show you  a diagnostic test of car images  because that's something we can all understand. So here we're starting with  about  .  million car images  and I want to create something that can split them into the angle of the photo that's being taken. So these images are entirely unlabeled  so I have to start from scratch. With our deep learning algorithm  it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images. So the nice thing is that the human and the computer can now work together. So the human  as you can see here  is telling the computer about areas of interest which it wants the computer then to try and use to improve its algorithm. Now  these deep learning systems actually are in        dimensional space  so you can see here the computer rotating this through that space  trying to find new areas of structure. And when it does so successfully  the human who is driving it can then point out the areas that are interesting. So here  the computer has successfully found areas  for example  angles. So as we go through this process  we're gradually telling the computer more and more about the kinds of structures we're looking for. You can imagine in a diagnostic test this would be a pathologist identifying areas of pathosis  for example  or a radiologist indicating potentially troublesome nodules. And sometimes it can be difficult for the algorithm. In this case  it got kind of confused. The fronts and the backs of the cars are all mixed up. So here we have to be a bit more careful  manually selecting these fronts as opposed to the backs  then telling the computer that this is a type of group that we're interested in. So we do that for a while  we skip over a little bit  and then we train the machine learning algorithm based on these couple of hundred things  and we hope that it's gotten a lot better. You can see  it's now started to fade some of these pictures out  showing us that it already is recognizing how to understand some of these itself. We can then use this concept of similar images  and using similar images  you can now see  the computer at this point is able to entirely find just the fronts of cars. So at this point  the human can tell the computer  okay  yes  you've done a good job of that. Sometimes  of course  even at this point it's still difficult to separate out groups. In this case  even after we let the computer try to rotate this for a while  we still find that the left sides and the right sides pictures are all mixed up together. So we can again give the computer some hints  and we say  okay  try and find a projection that separates out the left sides and the right sides as much as possible using this deep learning algorithm. And giving it that hint    ah  okay  it's been successful. It's managed to find a way of thinking about these objects that's separated out these together. So you get the idea here. This is a case not where the human is being replaced by a computer  but where they're working together. What we're doing here is we're replacing something that used to take a team of five or six people about seven years and replacing it with something that takes    minutes for one person acting alone. So this process takes about four or five iterations. You can see we now have    percent of our  .  million images  classified correctly. And at this point  we can start to quite quickly grab whole big sections  check through them to make sure that there's no mistakes. Where there are mistakes  we can let the computer know about them. And using this kind of process for each of the different groups  we are now up to an    percent success rate in classifying the  .  million images. And at this point  it's just a case of finding the small number that aren't classified correctly  and trying to understand why. And using that approach  by    minutes we get to    percent classification rates. So this kind of technique could allow us to fix a major problem  which is that there's a lack of medical expertise in the world. The World Economic Forum says that there's between a   x and a   x shortage of physicians in the developing world  and it would take about     years to train enough people to fix that problem. So imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches  So I'm very excited about the opportunities. I'm also concerned about the problems. The problem here is that every area in blue on this map is somewhere where services are over    percent of employment. What are services  These are services. These are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do. So    percent of the world's employment in the developed world is stuff that computers  have just learned how to do. What does that mean  Well  it'll be fine. They'll be replaced by other jobs. For example  there will be more jobs for data scientists. Well  not really. It doesn't take data scientists  very long to build these things. For example  these four algorithms were all built by the same guy. So if you think  oh   it's all happened before  we've seen the results in the past of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs  what are these new jobs going to be  It's very hard for us to estimate this  because human performance grows at this gradual rate  but we now have a system  deep learning  that we know actually grows in capability exponentially. And we're here. So currently  we see the things around us and we say   Oh  computers are still pretty dumb.  Right  But in five years' time  computers will be off this chart. So we need to be starting to think about this capability right now. We have seen this once before  of course. In the Industrial Revolution  we saw a step change in capability thanks to engines. The thing is  though  that after a while  things flattened out. There was social disruption  but once engines were used  to generate power in all the situations  things really settled down. The Machine Learning Revolution is going to be very different from the Industrial Revolution  because the Machine Learning Revolution  it never settles down. The better computers get at intellectual activities  the more they can build better computers to be better at intellectual capabilities  so this is going to be a kind of change that the world has actually never experienced before  so your previous understanding of what's possible is different. This is already impacting us. In the last    years  as capital productivity has increased  labor productivity has been flat  in fact even a little bit down. So I want us to start having this discussion now. I know that when I often tell people about this situation  people can be quite dismissive. Well  computers can't really think  they don't emote  they don't understand poetry  we don't really understand how they work. So what  Computers right now can do the things that humans spend most of their time being paid to do  so now's the time to start thinking about how we're going to adjust our social structures and economic structures to be aware of this new reality.

      "For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy  and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk. I'll try to spin a story about energy  and oil's a convenient starting place. The talk will be broadly about energy  but oil's a good place to start. And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff. You take about eight or so carbon atoms  about    hydrogen atoms  you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid  very energy dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels. It's great stuff. Now  as far as it goes  there's a lot of oil out there in the world. Here's my little pocket map of where it's all located. A bigger one for you to look at. But this is it  this is the oil in the world. Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is. This is about     trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today. Now  that's just one story about oil  and we could end it there and say   Well  oil's going to last forever because  well  there's just a lot of it.  But there's actually more to the story than that. Oh  by the way  if you think you're very far from some of this oil       meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world. Come talk to me about it  I'll fill in some of the details if you want. So  that's one of the stories of oil  there's just a lot of it. But what about oil  Where is it in the energy system  Here's a little snapshot of     years of oil  and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those     years. Now  here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about  For the last    years  oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems. There was one kind of peak oil in       when oil represented    percent of global energy supply. Now  it's about    percent. It's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline. Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in      and is declining. So oil is playing a less significant role every year. And so     years ago  there was a peak oil  just like  in the     s  there was a peak coal  and a hundred years before that  there was a peak wood. This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems. And what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades  Well  a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear  for starters. And what goes on in the future  Well  I think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas  and beyond that  peak renewables. Now  I'll tell you another little  very important story about this picture. Now  I'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing  it is    that's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it  we'll fill in some of the details    but there's a very important message here  This is     years of history  and for     years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system. Energy systems of the world becoming progressively    year on year  decade on decade  century on century    becoming less carbon intense. And that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today  reaching maybe    percent of primary energy by mid century. Now that might be the end of the story    Okay  we just replace it all with conventional renewables    but I think  actually  there's more to the story than that. And to tell the next part of the story    and this is looking out say      and beyond. What is the future of truly sustainable  carbon free energy  Well  we have to take a little excursion  and we'll start in central Texas. Here's a piece of limestone. I picked it up outside of Marble Falls  Texas. It's about     million years old. And it's just limestone  nothing really special about it. Now  here's a piece of chalk. I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger. And it's different than this limestone  you can see that. You wouldn't build a building out of this stuff  and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this. Yeah  it's very different    no  it's not different. It's not different  it's the same stuff  calcium carbonate  calcium carbonate. What's different is how the molecules are put together. Now  if you think that's kind of neat  the story gets really neat right now. Off the coast of California comes this  It's an abalone shell. Now  millions of abalone every year make this shell. Oh  by the way  just in case you weren't already guessing  it's calcium carbonate. It's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this. But it's not the same stuff  it's different. It's thousands of times  maybe       times tougher than this. And why  Because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers  making this beautiful  iridescent mother of pearl. Very specialized material that the abalone self assembles  millions of abalone  all the time  every day  every year. This is pretty incredible stuff. All the same  what's different  How the molecules are put together. Now  what does this have to do with energy  Here's a piece of coal. And I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk. Now  whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers  or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells  nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to. Nature didn't need to because  unlike the abalone shell  the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials  until maybe now when it might just matter. So  when we think about the future of energy  imagine what would it be like if instead of this  we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently. And so that is my story. The oil will never run out. It's not because we have a lot of it. It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills. It's because  well  thousands of years ago  people invented ideas    they had ideas  innovations  technology    and the Stone Age ended  not because we ran out of stones. It's ideas  it's innovation  it's technology that will end the age of oil  long before we run out of oil. Thank you very much.\n",
      "America's public energy conversation boils down to this question  Would you rather die of A  oil wars  or B  climate change  or C  nuclear holocaust  or D  all of the above  Oh  I missed one  or E  none of the above  That's the one we're not normally offered. What if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing  Could we have fuel without fear  Could we reinvent fire  You see  fire made us human  fossil fuels made us modern. But now we need a new fire that makes us safe  secure  healthy and durable. Let's see how. Four fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo. Those fossil fuels have built our civilization. They've created our wealth. They've enriched the lives of billions. But they also have rising costs to our security  economy  health and environment that are starting to erode  if not outweigh their benefits. So we need a new fire. And switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity  each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air. But they're really quite distinct. Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil    although almost half is made from coal. Their uses are quite concentrated. Three fourths of our oil fuel is transportation. Three fourths of our electricity powers buildings. And the rest of both runs factories. So very efficient vehicles  buildings and factories save oil and coal  and also natural gas that can displace both of them. But today's energy system is not just inefficient  it is also disconnected  aging  dirty and insecure. So it needs refurbishment. By      though  it could become efficient  connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos  factories and buildings all relying on a modern  secure and resilient electricity system. We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by      and use one third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply. This could cost  by       five trillion dollars less in net present value  that is expressed as a lump sum today  than business as usual    assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero    a conservatively low estimate. Yet this cheaper energy system could support     percent bigger U.S. economy all without needing oil or coal  or for that matter nuclear energy. Moreover  this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes  mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock. Let me say that again. I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal  five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit. In other words  we're going to use our most effective institutions    private enterprise co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions. And whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security  or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health  reinventing fire makes sense and makes money. General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies. So in reinventing fire  we integrated all four sectors that use energy    transportation  buildings  industry and electricity    and we integrated four kinds of innovation  not just technology and policy  but also design and business strategy. Those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts  especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities. Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day  plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs  raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP. Our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles. So let's start by making autos oil free. Two thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight. And every unit of energy you save at the wheels  by taking out weight or drag  saves seven units in the tank  because you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels. Unfortunately  over the past quarter century  epidemic obesity has made our two ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have. But today  ultralight  ultrastrong materials  like carbon fiber composites  can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build. Lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them  so their engines get smaller. Indeed  that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper. So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today  while the driving cost  even from the start  is very much lower. So these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and seal stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other    namely ultralight materials  making them into structures and electric propulsion. The sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates  that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones. And just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency. The resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers. Of course  computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry  while typewriter makers have vanished. So vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next    years  but then also make electrification affordable  and that displaces the rest of the oil. America could lead this next automotive revolution. Currently the leader is Germany. Last year  Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting     miles a gallon. Also last year  BMW announced this carbon fiber electric car  they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries. And they said   We do not intend to be a typewriter maker.  Audi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year. Seven years ago  an even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part  which doubles as a carbon cap. In one minute    and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is. Don't worry about dropping it  it's tougher than titanium. Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it. But such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance. They can save four fifths of the capital needed to make autos. They can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to    times as much crash energy per pound as steel. If we made all of our autos this way  it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabias  or half an OPEC  by drilling in the Detroit formation  a very prospective play. And all those mega barrels under Detroit cost an average of    bucks a barrel. They are all American  carbon free and inexhaustible. The same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles. In the five years ending with       Walmart saved    percent of the fuel per ton mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design. But just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two thirds. And combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes  now on the drawing board  can save close to a trillion dollars. Also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R D has given us the Internet  the Global Positioning System and the jet engine and microchip industries. As we design and build vehicles better  we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving. Instead of just seeing the travel grow  we can use innovative pricing  charging for road infrastructure by the mile  not by the gallon. We can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing. We can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be  so they don't need to go somewhere else. And we can use smart IT to make traffic free flowing. Together  those things can give us the same or better access with    to    percent less driving  saving another  .  trillion dollars  plus  .  trillion dollars from using trucks more productively. So    years hence  when you add it all up  a far more mobile U.S. economy can use no oil. Saving or displacing barrels for    bucks rather than buying them for over a hundred  adds up to a    trillion net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero. So to get mobility without oil  to phase out the oil  we can get efficient and then switch fuels. Those     to     mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells  electricity and advanced biofuels. The trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels. The trucks could even use natural gas. But no vehicles will need oil. And the most biofuel we might need  just three million barrels a day  can be made two thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate. Our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call  institutional acupuncture.  We figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly  we stick little needles in it to get it flowing  working with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon. And the long transition is already well under way. In fact  three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil  not in supply  but in demand. And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around     . In other words  oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices. But the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid. Rather  when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids  they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate varying solar and wind power. So the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately. And they also converge the oil story with our second big story  saving electricity and then making it differently. And those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector  because we've got   st century technology and speed colliding head on with   th and   th century institutions  rules and cultures. Changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it. Most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we're installing them. So the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper. But as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy  America's electricity use could actually shrink  even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos. And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends. Over the next    years  buildings  which use three quarters of the electricity  can triple or quadruple their energy productivity  saving  .  trillion dollars  net present value  with a    percent internal rate of return or in English  the savings are worth four times what they cost. And industry can accelerate too  doubling its energy productivity with a    percent internal rate of return. The key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings. That is  it can give you expanding returns  not diminishing returns. That is how our      retrofit is saving over two fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building    remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light  but reflect heat. plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third. And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved    million dollars of capital cost  which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years. Integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry. Dow's billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars. But industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save. For example  three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors. Half of that runs pumps and fans. And those can all be made more efficient  and the motors that turn them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating    improvements  paying back in about a year. But first we ought to be capturing bigger  cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks. For example  pumps  the biggest use of motors  move liquid through pipes. But a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least    percent less energy  not by getting better pumps  but just by replacing long  thin  crooked pipes with fat  short  straight pipes. This is not about new technology  it's just rearranging our metal furniture. Of course  it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs. So what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three fifths used in motors  Well  from the coal burned at the power plant through all these compounding losses  only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow. But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards  and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves    units of fuel cost  pollution and what Hunter Lovins calls  global weirding  back at the power plant. And of course  as you go back upstream  the components get smaller and therefore cheaper. Our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than    billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns    everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries. Typically our retrofit designs save about    to    percent of the energy and pay back in a few years  while the new facility designs save    to    odd percent with generally lower capital cost. Now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity  chiefly renewables. China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost. In fact  these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart. And Germany now has more solar workers than America has steel workers. Already in about    states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill. Such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company. And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams. Renewables are no longer a fringe activity. For each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable  mainly lately in developing countries. In       renewables other than big hydro  particularly wind and solar cells  got     billion dollars of private investment  and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding    billion watts in that one year. That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year    a number that goes up    or    percent a year. In contrast  the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk. In fact in this country  no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital  despite seven years of     plus percent subsidies. So how else could we replace the coal fired power plants  Well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and  combined with renewables  can displace them more than    times at less than their replacement cost. But we only need to replace them once. We're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on  because they're       whereas wind and solar power are variable  and hence supposedly unreliable. Actually no generator is     . They all break. And when a big plant goes down  you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds  often for weeks or months  often without warning. That is exactly why we've designed the grid to back up failed plants with working plants. And in exactly the same way  the grid can handle wind and solar power's forecastable variations. Hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted  integrated and diversified by both type and location. And that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid. That is how  for example  four German states in      were    to    percent wind powered. Portugal was    percent renewable powered  Denmark   . And it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity. In America  our aging  dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by     . And whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same  about six trillion dollars at present value    whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so called clean coal  or renewables that are more or less centralized. But those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks  around national security  fuel  water  finance  technology  climate and health. For example  our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack. But that blackout risk disappears  and all of the other risks are best managed  with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect  but can stand alone at need. That is  they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly. That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply. They think they need that  how about the rest of us that they're defending  We want our stuff to work too. At about the same cost as business as usual  this would maximize national security  customer choice  entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation. Together  efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector. Traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables. And those utilities were rewarded  as they still are in    states  for selling you more electricity. However  especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills  the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency  demand response  cogeneration  renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage. So our energy future is not fate  but choice  and that choice is very flexible. In       for example  government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down. And I heretically suggested it could go down several fold. Well that's what's actually happened so far. It's fallen by half. But with today's much better technologies  more mature delivery channels and integrative design  we can do far more and even cheaper. So to solve the energy problem  we just needed to enlarge it. And the results may at first seem incredible  but as Marshall McLuhan said   Only puny secrets need protection. Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity.  Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions  both driven by modern efficiency  and you get the really big story  reinventing fire  where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by       saving   trillion dollars  growing the economy  .  fold  strengthening out national security  oh  and by the way  by getting rid of the oil and coal  reducing the fossil carbon emissions by    to    percent. Now if you like any of those outcomes  you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important. So focusing on outcomes  not motives  can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge. This also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges    climate change  nuclear proliferation  energy insecurity  energy poverty    all of which make us less safe. Now our team at RMI helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives  with some more hatching. Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too. Former oil man Maurice Strong said   Not all the fossils are in the fuel.  But as Edgar Woolard  who used to chair Dupont  reminds us   Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because   he said   they simply won't be around long term.  I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity  but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species. We humans are inventing a new fire  not dug from below  but flowing from above  not scarce  but bountiful  not local  but everywhere  not transient  but permanent  not costly  but free. And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure  this new fire is flameless. Efficiently used  it really can do our work without working our undoing. Each of you owns a piece of that    trillion prize. And our new book  Reinventing Fire  describes how you can capture it. So with the conversation just begun at ReinventingFire.com  let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other  with everyone around you  to help make the world richer  fairer  cooler and safer by together reinventing fire. Thank you.\n",
      "The old story about climate protection is that it's costly  or it would have been done already. So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it. The new story about climate protection is that it's not costly  but profitable. This was a simple sign error  because it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel  as is well known to companies that do it all the time    for example  Dupont  SD micro electronics. Many other firms    IBM    are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants  and they get their money back in two or three years. That's called a profit. Now  similarly  the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it  it would be expensive  or we would have done it already  because markets are essentially perfect. If  of course  that were true  there would be no innovation  and nobody could make any money. But the new story about oil is the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil    not just incrementally  but completely    quite the contrary. The United States  for example  can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time  led by business for profit  because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it. This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict  particularly over oil. This thesis is set out in a book called  Winning the Oil Endgame  that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgame.com    about         downloads so far. And it was co sponsored by the Pentagon    it's independent  it's peer reviewed and all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal. Now  a bit of economic history  I think  may be helpful here. Around       one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling. And whale oil lit practically every building. But in the nine years before Drake struck oil  in       at least five sixths of that whale oil illuminating market disappeared  thanks to fatal competitors  chiefly oil and gas made from coal  to which the whalers had not been paying attention. So  very unexpectedly  they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales. The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit maximizing capitalists. And it's funny    it feels a bit like this now for oil. We've been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil  and no one had bothered to add them up before. So when we did  we found some very surprising things. Now  there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil. Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk. On the competitiveness front  we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together. And serious competition from Europe  from Korea  and next is China  which will soon be a major net exporter of cars. How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new wally badged Shanghai automotive super efficient car  Maybe a decade  according to my friends in Detroit. China has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap frog technology. They're not going to export your uncle's Buick. And after that comes India. The point here is  these cars are going to be made super efficient. The question is  who will make them  Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil  or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars  That seems to make more sense. The more we keep on using the oil  particularly the imported oil  the more we face a very obvious array of problems. Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing  but nothing is not the right number. It could well be enough to double the oil price  for example. And one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil  if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don't have oil. And our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far off istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect American citizens. They don't like fighting over oil  they don't like being in the sands and they don't like where the oil money goes and what sort of instability it creates. Now  in order to avoid these problems  whatever you think they're worth  it's actually not that complicated. We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently  at a cost of    dollars per saved barrel. And then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio fuels and safe natural gas. And that costs on average under    dollars a barrel. And compared with the official forecast  that oil will cost    dollars a barrel in       which is half of what we've been paying lately  that will save    billion dollars a year  starting quite soon. Now  in order to do this we need to invest about     billion dollars  half of it to retool the car  truck and plane industries  half of it to build the advanced bio fuel industry. In the process  we will gain about a million good jobs  mainly rural. And protect another million jobs now at risk  mainly in auto making. And we'll also get returns over     billion dollars a year. So that's a very handsome return. It's financeable in the private capital market. But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned  to happen sooner and with higher confidence  then    and also to expand choice and manage risk    then you might like some light handed public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic. And these policies work fine without taxes  subsidies or mandates. They make a little net money for the treasury. They have a broad trans ideological appeal  and because we want them actually to happen  we figured out ways to do them that do not require much  if any  federal legislation  and can  indeed  be done administratively or at a state level. Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem  namely  light vehicles  here are four ultra light carbon composite concept cars with low drag  and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive. You can sort of have it all with these things. For example  this Opel two seater does     miles an hour at    miles a gallon. This muscle car from Toyota      horsepower in an ultra light that does zero to    in well under four seconds  and still gets    miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this. And in the upper left  a pioneering effort    years ago by GM       miles a gallon without even using a hybrid  in a four seater. Well  saving that fuel     percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about    cents per saved gallon. But it's even a better deal for heavy trucks  where you save a similar amount at    cents a gallon  with better aerodynamics and tires and engines  and so on  and taking out weight so you can put it into payload. So you can double efficiency with a    percent internal rate of return. Then you can go even further  almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements  double the big haulers' margins. And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull  and flip the market. In the airplane business  it's again a similar story where the first    percent fuel saving is free  as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner. But then the next generation of planes saves about half. Again  much cheaper than buying the fuel. And if you go over the next    years or so to a blended wing body  kind of a flying wing with internal engines  then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost. Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles  the cars and light trucks  because we all know the most about those  probably everybody here drives one. And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan  of all the fuel energy you feed into the car  seven eighths never gets to the wheels  it's lost first in the engine  idling at zero miles a gallon  the power train and accessories. So then of the energy that does get to the wheels  only an eighth of it  half of that  goes to heat the tires on the road  or to heat the air the car pushes aside. And only this little bit  only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop. In fact  since    percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver  less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver. This is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort. Moreover  three fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car. And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels. So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter. And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that    well  then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car  and it would cost a lot more to make  because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium. But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials. For example  we use a lot of carbon fiber composites in sporting goods. And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety. Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t boned by a Golf. The Golf was totaled. The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel. They'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later. But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at    miles an hour  the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon fiber composite cones  weighing a total of    pounds  hidden in the front end. Because these materials could actually absorb six to    times as much energy per pound as steel  and do so a lot more smoothly. And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight. We could make cars bigger  which is protective  but make them light. Whereas if we made them heavy  they'd be both hostile and inefficient. And when you make them light in the right way  that can be simpler and cheaper to make. You can end up saving money  and lives  and oil  all at the same time. I showed here two years ago a little bit about a design of your basic  uncompromised  quintupled efficiency suburban assault vehicle       and this is a complete virtual design that is production costed manufacturable. And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely. We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very stiff  strong  carbon composite material  and then ways to thermoform it  because it's a combination of carbon and nylon  into whatever complex shapes you want  like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier one suppliers. And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified. Because the auto body has only  say     parts  instead of         . Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set  instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel. Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist. They snap together like a kid's toy. So you got rid of the body shop. And if you want  you can lay color in the mold  and get rid of the paint shop. Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car. So you end up with at least two fifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry  which GM has in Lansing. The plant also gets smaller. Now  when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil  including buildings  industry  feedstocks and so on  you find that of the    million barrels a day the government says we will need in       well  about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then  with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over  at an average cost of only    bucks a barrel  instead of    for buying the oil. And then another six can be made robustly  competitively  from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio diesel  without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production. There is a huge amount of gas to be saved  about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price. And here are some no brainer substitutions of it  with lots left over. So much  in fact  that after you've handled the domestic oil forecast from areas already approved  you have only this little bit left  and let's see how we can meet that  because there's a pretty flexible menu of ways. We could  of course  buy more efficiency. Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at    bucks instead of   . Or wait to capture the second half of it. Or we could  of course  just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil  or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us. But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead  because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers  and they don't. Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance  or if we used it as hydrogen  which is more profitable and efficient  we'd get rid of the domestic oil too. And that doesn't even count  for example  that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country. So we have lots of options. And the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible. Now  to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence  there is a few ways government could help. For example  fee bates  a combination of a fee and a rebate in any size class of vehicle you want  can increase the price of inefficient vehicles and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles. You're not paid to change size class. You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class  in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three. This expands choice rapidly in the market  and actually makes more money for automakers as well. I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low income families to get efficient  reliable  warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get. And for each car so financed  scrap almost one clunker  preferably the dirtiest ones. This creates a new million car a year market for Detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise  because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car. And Detroit will make money on every unit. It turns out that if  say  African American and white households had the same car ownership  it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities. So this is a huge social win  too. Governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year. There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster. And we could even do an X Prize style golden carrot that's worth stretching further for. For example  a billion dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker to sell         really advanced vehicles  like some you saw earlier. Then the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills  but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that  there are ways to finance it. And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes  so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air  they would waste more oil  and block the uptake of efficient  new planes. Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive. We ought to take them out back and shoot them  and put bounty hunters after them. Then there's an important military role. That in creating the move to high volume  low cost commercial production of these kinds of materials  or for that matter  ultra light steels that are a good backup technology  the military can do the trick it did in turning DARPAnet into the Internet. Just turn it over to the private sector  and we have an Internet. The same for GPS. The same for the modern semi conductor industry. That is  military science and technology that they need can create the advanced materials industrial cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil  which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security. Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining  and shift the convergence of the energy and ag value chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates  and get out of our own way in other ways. And make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster. But here's how the whole thing fits together. Instead of official forecasts of oil use and oil imports going forever up  they can turn down with the    dollars a barrel efficiency  down steeply by adding the supply side substitutions at    bucks  all implemented at slower rates than we've done before when we paid attention. And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there  we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the     s. And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before. In this eight year period       to     when we last paid attention  the economy grew    percent  oil use fell    percent  oil imports fell    percent  oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell    percent. They would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year. Well  that was with very old technologies and delivery methods. We could rerun that play a lot better now. And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC. Ours is on the demand side. We are the Saudi Arabia of  nega barrels.   Laughter  We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil. Whatever your reason for wanting to do this  whether you're concerned about national security or price volatility       or jobs  or the planet  or your grand kids  it seems to me that this is an oil endgame that we should all be playing to win.

      "So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills and why this is an incredibly important  long  oily  hot summer  and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted. But before I talk about the political chemistry  I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil. This is a photograph from when I visited Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in      to watch the Minerals Management Service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice. And what you see here is  you see a little bit of crude oil  you see some ice cubes  and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm. The napalm is burning there quite nicely. And the thing is  is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer. We're four percent of the world's population  we use    percent of the world's oil production. And we don't really understand what oil is  until you check out its molecules  And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn. So this is what happens as that burn gets going. It takes off. It's a big woosh. I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday  because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again. It'll just bake your retinas. So there it is  the retinas are baking. Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil. Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules. It starts of with the very small ones  which are one carbon  four hydrogen    that's methane    it just floats off. Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon. You've probably heard of benzene rings  they're very carcinogenic. And it goes all the way over to these big  thick  galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons  and they have thousands of hydrogens  and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them. Those are called the asphaltenes  they're an ingredient in asphalt. They're very important in oil spills. Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water. It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous. Oil doesn't sink  it floats. If it sank  it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill. And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water. It spreads out to be really thin  so you have a hard time corralling it. The next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate  and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that  and shrimp. And then the asphaltenes    and this is the crucial thing    the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion  something like mayonnaise. It triples the amount of oily  messy goo that you have in the water  and it makes it very hard to handle. It also makes it very viscous. When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain  there were big  floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil  with the consistency  or the viscosity  of chewing gum. It's incredibly hard to clean up. And every single oil is different when it hits water. When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics  it's absolutely explosive. For the first time  American consumers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves. They have a  eureka   moment  when we suddenly understand oil in a different context. So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics  because it's really crucial to understanding why this summer is so important  why we need to stay focused. Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks   Wow  I'm going to go buy some three carbon to    carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work.  No  they think   Ugh. I have to go buy gas. I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off. They set the prices  and I don't even know. I am helpless over this.  And this is what happens to us at the gas pump    and actually  gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger. You might notice that many gas pumps  including this one  are designed to look like ATMs. I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger  because supposedly we feel good about ATMs. That shows you how bad it is. But actually  I mean  this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy  not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market. And the thing is  too  is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume  which is somewhat reasonable  because in fact  we have designed this system where  if you want to get a job  it's much more important to have a car that runs  to have a job and keep a job  than to have a GED. And that's actually very perverse. Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas  which is that we'd rather be doing anything else. This is BP's gas station in downtown Los Angeles. It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.  Now   you think   why would something so lame work on people so smart   Well  the reason is  is because  when we're buying gas  we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance. I mean  we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else. We don't want to be buying oil  we want to be doing something green. And we get kind of in on our own con. I mean    and this is funny  it looks funny here. But in fact  that's why the slogan  beyond petroleum  worked. But it's an inherent part of our energy policy  which is we don't talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use. We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars. We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet. And so  cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil  and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill. Okay  so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States. The oil industry is like a huge  gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else  but we actually see it in very moral terms. This is an early on photograph    you can see  we had these gushers. Early journalists looked at these spills  and they said   This is a filthy industry.  But they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing. They weren't farmers  they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground. It's the  Beverly Hillbillies   basically. But in the beginning  this was seen as a very morally problematic thing  long before it became funny. And then  of course  there was John D. Rockefeller. And the thing about John D. is that he went into this chaotic wild east of oil industry  and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company  a multinational. It was terrifying  you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now  imagine what this looked like in the     s or     s. And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy. But what's really amazing is that Ida Tarbell  the journalist  went in and did a big expos  of Rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place. But in many ways  that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us. And here's one of the things that Ida Tarbell said    she said   He has a thin nose like a thorn. There were no lips. There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them.  Okay  so that guy is actually still with us. I mean  this is a very pervasive    this is part of our DNA. And then there's this guy  okay. So  you might be wondering why it is that  every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill  we call these CEOs down to Washington  and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them. And this is something that we've been doing since       when we first asked them   Why are there these obscene profits   And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs. And we take it as  you know    we look at it on a moral level  rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level. And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions    I'm just saying that  when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards  you don't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate  or you're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil. So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction. But it makes for good theater  and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week. So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing. I mean  these pictures    this is from the Santa Barbara spill. You have these pictures of birds. They really influence people. When the Santa Barbara spill happened in       it formed the environmental movement in its modern form. It started Earth Day. It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act  the Clean Air Act  the Clean Water Act. Everything that we are really stemmed from this period. I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us. Here we are normally  we're standing at the gas pump  and we're feeling kind of helpless. We look at these pictures and we understand  for the first time  our role in this supply chain. We connect the dots in the supply chain. And we have this kind of    as voters  we have kind of a  eureka   moment. This is why these moments of these oil spills are so important. But it's also really important that we don't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it. We actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem. One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms. We were very reactive  as opposed to being proactive about what happened. And so what we did was  actually  we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling. We stopped drilling in ANWR  but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed. In fact  it's continued to increase. The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices. As you can see  our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out. We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves     percent of them are in the Persian Gulf. One of the things that's happened because of this is that  since       the country of Nigeria  or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil  which is the delta    which is two times the size of Maryland    has had thousands of oil spills a year. I mean  we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations. That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill every year since     . And we can wrap our heads around the spills  because that's what we see here  but in fact  these guys actually live in a war zone. There's a thousand battle related deaths a year in this area twice the size of Maryland  and it's all related to the oil. And these guys  I mean  if they were in the U.S.  they might be actually here in this room. They have degrees in political science  degrees in business    they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing. And it's sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us. The other thing that we've done  as we've continued to increase demand  is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs. One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad  with Exxon. So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it  the World Bank  Exxon paid for it. We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem. I was there in     . We were driving along this dark  dark road  and the guy in the green stepped out  and I was just like   Ahhh  This is it.  And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out  and we realized it was okay. They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields. But at the same time  Chad has become much more unstable  and we are not paying for that price at the pump. We pay for it in our taxes on April   th. We do the same thing with the price of policing the Persian Gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open. This is         we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year. That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump. We pay for it on April   th  and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement. The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the Gulf of Mexico  which was not part of the moratoriums. Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico    as you can see  this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil. It's become this intense industrialized zone. It doesn't have the same resonance for us that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has  but it should  I mean  it's a bird sanctuary. Also  every time you buy gasoline in the United States  half of it is actually being refined along the coast  because the Gulf actually has about    percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well. So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less clean environment. And finally  American families also pay a price for oil. Now on the one hand  the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil  but on the other hand  the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work  generally in a fairly crummy car. If you look at people who make         a year  they have two kids  they might have three jobs or more  and then they have to really commute. They're actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care. And the same thing happens at the   th percentile  around       . Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the American economy  but they're also a drain on individual families and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher. So  what I'm going to talk to you about now is  what do we have to do this time  What are the laws  What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused  One thing is    we need to stay away from the theater. We need to stay away from the moratoriums. We need to focus really back again on the molecules. The moratoriums are fine  but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil. One of the things that we also need to do  is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world  before you reduce the amount of oil that we use. We need to focus on reducing the oil. What you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy. It comes in on the side    the useful stuff is the dark gray  and the un useful stuff  which is called the rejected energy    the waste  goes up to the top. Now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount. And one of the things that we need to do is  not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient  but we also need to fix the economy in general. We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel. For example  we have an insurance system where the person who drives        miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives      . We actually encourage people to drive more. We have policies that reward sprawl    we have all kinds of policies. We need to have more mobility choices. We need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil. And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry  which is at least    billion dollars a year  into something that allows middle class people to find better ways to commute. Whether that's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road  this is where we need to be. We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing  and you can find more about this policy. It's called STRONG  which is  Secure Transportation Reducing Oil Needs Gradually   and the idea is instead of being helpless  we need to be more strong. They're up at NewAmerica.net. What's important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump  to actually being active and to really sort of thinking about who we are  having kind of that special moment  where we connect the dots actually at the pump. Now supposedly  oil taxes are the third rail of American politics    the no fly zone. I actually    I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much  but I think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline  and upped it to six cents next year  nine cents the following year  all the way up to    cents by       that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption  and at the same time we would give people time to prepare  time to respond  and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time. Let me give you a little sense of how this would work. This is a gas receipt  hypothetically  for a year from now. The first thing that you have on the tax is    you have a tax for a stronger America       cents. So you're not helpless at the pump. And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign  very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack. And what it says is   The National Academy of Sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates    cents in health care costs.  That's a lot. And so this    you can see that you're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax. And also  the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system. And at the same time  you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting  or a low interest loan on a different kind of car  or whatever it is you're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence. With this whole sort of suite of policies  we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption    or our oil consumption    by    percent by     . So  three million barrels a day. But in order to do this  one of the things we really need to do  is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon. We need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater  not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there. We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules. Thank you.\n",
      "What is bioenergy  Bioenergy is not ethanol. Bioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy is oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building that bridge to the future  to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way  or put up these geo spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff  is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do that  you really have to look first at agriculture. So we've been planting stuff for        years. And in the measure that we plant stuff  what we learn from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests  you've got to deal with all types of awful things  you've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate  then you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile. You're going to be able to power stuff  so irrigation makes a difference. Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it  as opposed to where the rivers flood. You start getting this organic agriculture  you start putting machinery onto this stuff. Machinery  with a whole bunch of water  leads to very large scale agriculture. You put together machines and water  and you get landscapes that look like this. And then you get sales that look like this. It's brute force. So what you've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that's a reasonably natural system. You start taming that natural system. You put a lot of force behind that natural system. You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides    end up with systems that look like this. And it's all brute force. And that's the way we've been approaching energy. So the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology. And you move from a discipline of engineering  you move from a discipline of chemistry  into a discipline of biology. And probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me. This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India and China no longer have these massive famines is because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the Green Revolution. That is something that a lot of people have criticized. But of course  those are people who don't realize that China and India  instead of having huge amounts of starving people  are exporting grains. And the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research  which was Mexico  didn't adopt this technology  ignored this technology  talked about why this technology should be thought about  but not really applied. And Mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesn't apply technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in fact  hasn't recognized this man  to the point where there aren't statues of this man all over Mexico. There are in China and India. And the Institute that this guy ran has now moved to India. That is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies. Now  it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world. It's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does  if you understand biology. What happened in agriculture  Well  if you take agriculture over a century  agriculture in about      would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah  the plows look different. The machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules  but the farmer would have understood  this is what the guy's doing  this is why he's doing it  this is where he's going. What really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology  and that's where you get your productivity increases. And as you do that stuff  here's what happens to productivity. Basically  you go from     hours to produce     bushels  to     to     to five. Agricultural labor productivity increased seven times       to       whereas the rest of the economy increased about  .  times. This is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person. The effect of this  of course  is it's not just amber waves of grain  it is mountains of stuff. And    percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced. This would be a good outcome for energy. And of course  by now  you're probably saying to yourself   Self  I thought I came to a talk about energy and here's this guy talking about biology.  So where's the link between these two things  One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand. We don't even know what oil is. We don't know where oil comes from. I mean  literally  it's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from. The best assumption  and one of the best guesses in this stuff  is that this stuff comes out of this stuff  that these things absorb sunlight  rot under pressure for millions of years  and you get these black rivers. Now  the interesting thing about that thesis    if that thesis turns out to be true    is that oil  and all hydrocarbons  turned out to be concentrated sunlight. And if you think of bioenergy  bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is taking the sun  concentrating it in amoebas  concentrating it in plants  and maybe that's why you get these rainbows. And as you're looking at this system  if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight  then bioenergy works in a different way. And we've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels. Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas  the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots. This is how you farm oil. And as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved  we started with this brute force approach. And then what did we learn  Then we learned we had to go bigger. And then what'd we learn  Then we have to go even bigger. And we are getting really destructive as we're going out and farming this bioenergy. These are the Athabasca tar sands  and there's an enormous amount    first of mining  the largest trucks in the world are working here  and then you've got to pull out this black sludge  which is basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it  which only works at today's oil prices. Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff. It is probably plants  except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure. So you take something like this  you burn it  you put it under pressure  and likely as not  you get this. Although  again  I stress  we don't know. Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But as you think of coal  this is what burned wheat kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal. And of course  coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines  you get gas. When that gas blows up  people die. So you're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines  but not in others. Any place you see a differential  there're some interesting questions. There's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff. But again  coal. Maybe the same stuff  maybe the same system  maybe bioenergy  and you're applying exactly the same technology. Here's your brute force approach. Once you get through your brute force approach  then you just rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions  which are coal fired gas plants. That is probably not the best use of bioenergy. As you think of what are the alternatives to this system    it's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in its petroleum reserves  but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves  nor is China. There are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there  and we've got to start thinking of them as biological energy  because if we keep treating them as chemical energy  or engineering energy  we're going to be in deep doo doo. Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological product. And as you think of gas  well  you're familiar with gas. And here's a different way of mining coal. This is called coal bed methane. Why is this picture interesting  Because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life  the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another    the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up    may be because there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas. This is a well known phenomenon.  Laughter  You eat certain things  you produce a lot of gas. It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process. If that is true  then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off  and it may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture. That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not importing corn into Iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture  from brute force into biological force. And in the measure that you can do that  you can clean some stuff  and you can clean it pretty quickly. We already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff. OK  if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades  you can get a really substantial increase  like an eight fold increase  in your output. This is just the beginning stages of this stuff. And as you think of biomaterials  this guy    who did part of the sequencing of the human genome  who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world    has been thinking about how you structure this. And there's a series of smart people thinking about this. And they've been putting together companies like Synthetic Genomics  like  a Cambria  like Codon  and what those companies are trying to do is to think of  how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force  Think of it in the following terms. Think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes. Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the genes as a software. And in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable  that can become energy  that can become food  that can become fiber  that can become human beings  that can become a whole series of things  then you've got to shift your approach as to how you're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way. What are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading  This is one of the gentle giants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human beings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton Smith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to cut genes    something called restriction enzymes. He was at Hopkins when he did this  and he's such a modest guy that the day he won  his mother called him and said   I didn't realize there was another Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just won the Nobel    Laughter  I mean  that was Mom  but anyway  this guy is just a class act. You find him at the bench every single day  working on a pipette and building stuff. And one of the things this guy just built are these things. What is this  This is the first transplant of naked DNA  where you take an entire DNA operating system out of one cell  insert it into a different cell  and have that cell boot up as a separate species. That's one month old. You will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff. And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are  we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies. We're going to start thinking about biology entering energy. It is very expensive to process this stuff  both in economic terms and in energy terms. This is what accumulates in the tar sands of Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you separate that petroleum from the sand  and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor    steam to separate this stuff    you also have to separate out the sulfur. The difference between light crude and heavy crude    well  it's about    bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way  the scale on these things is pretty large. Now  if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this  you reduce the system  and you really do start applying biological principles to energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind  to the point where you can get to solar  to the point where you can get to nuclear    and hopefully you won't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault.  Laughter  Just a thought. But in the meantime  for the next decade at least  the name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that oil  be that gas  be that coal  this is what we're dealing with. And before I make this talk too long  here's what's happening in the current energy system.    percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons. That means    percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a role in here for conservation. There's a role in here for alternative stuff  but we've also got to get that other portion right. How we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future. And as we think of this bridge to the future  one of the things you should ponder is  we are leaving about two thirds of the oil today inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there. Which  of course  requires more energy to go out and get energy. The ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may even be a one to one ratio on the energy input and the energy output. That is a stupid way of managing this system. Last point  last graph. One of the things that we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This is what oil prices look like  OK  This is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up with really smart ideas for solar panels  or for wind  or for something else  and then guess what  The oil price goes through the floor. That company goes out of business  and then you can bring the oil price back up. So if I had one closing and modest suggestion  let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the United States. How do you do that  Well  let's put a tax on oil that is a non revenue tax  and it basically says for the next    years  the price of oil will be    whatever you want     bucks     bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that  we tax it. If the OPEC price goes above that  the tax goes away. What does that do for entrepreneurs  What does it do for companies  It tells people  if you can produce energy for less than    bucks a barrel  or less than    bucks a barrel  or less than    bucks a barrel    let's debate it    you will have a business. But let's not put people through this cycle where it doesn't pay to research because your company will go out of business as OPEC drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening. Thank you.\n",

      "I know what you're thinking. You think I've lost my way  and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat. I get that all the time in Dubai.  Here on holiday are you  dear    Come to visit the children  How long are you staying   Well actually  I hope for a while longer yet. I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over    years. And in that time  I have seen a lot of changes. Now that statistic is quite shocking. And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English. I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi. And one fine day  she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary. But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants  as well as their uses    medicinal uses  cosmetics  cooking  herbal. How did those students get all that knowledge  Of course  from their grandparents and even their great grandparents. It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations. But sadly  today  languages are dying at an unprecedented rate. A language dies every    days. Now  at the same time  English is the undisputed global language. Could there be a connection  Well I don't know. But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes. When I first came out to the Gulf  I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post. Actually  not that long ago. That is a little bit too early. But nevertheless  I was recruited by the British Council  along with about    other teachers. And we were the first non Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait. We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education. And of course  the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth. Okay. Now this is the major change that I've seen    how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today. No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum  and no longer the sole domain of mother England  it has become a bandwagon for every English speaking nation on earth. And why not  After all  the best education    according to the latest World University Rankings    is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S. So everybody wants to have an English education  naturally. But if you're not a native speaker  you have to pass a test. Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone  Perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius. Would he need the same language as a lawyer  for example  Well  I don't think so. We English teachers reject them all the time. We put a stop sign  and we stop them in their tracks. They can't pursue their dream any longer  'til they get English. Now let me put it this way  if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer  would I stop him from entering my British University  I don't think so. But indeed  that is exactly what we do. We English teachers are the gatekeepers. And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough. Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society. Maybe the barrier would be too universal. Okay.  But   I hear you say   what about the research  It's all in English.  So the books are in English  the journals are done in English  but that is a self fulfilling prophecy. It feeds the English requirement. And so it goes on. I ask you  what happened to translation  If you think about the Islamic Golden Age  there was lots of translation then. They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic  into Persian  and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages. And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe. Now don't get me wrong  I am not against teaching English  all you English teachers out there. I love it that we have a global language. We need one today more than ever. But I am against using it as a barrier. Do we really want to end up with     languages and the main one being English  or Chinese  We need more than that. Where do we draw the line  This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English  which is quite arbitrary. And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English  they didn't have to pass an English test. Case in point  Einstein. He  by the way  was considered remedial at school because he was  in fact  dyslexic. But fortunately for the world  he did not have to pass an English test. Because they didn't start until      with TOEFL  the American test of English. Now it's exploded. There are lots and lots of tests of English. And millions and millions of students take these tests every year. Now you might think  you and me   Those fees aren't bad  they're okay   but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people. So immediately  we're rejecting them. It brings to mind a headline I saw recently   Education  The Great Divide.  Now I get it  I understand why people would want to focus on English. They want to give their children the best chance in life. And to do that  they need a Western education. Because  of course  the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities  that I put on earlier. It's a circular thing. Okay. Let me tell you a story about two scientists  two English scientists. They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals. But they couldn't get the results they wanted. They really didn't know what to do  until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb  whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German. So bingo  problem solved. If you can't think a thought  you are stuck. But if another language can think that thought  then  by cooperating  we can achieve and learn so much more. My daughter came to England from Kuwait. She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic. It's an Arabic medium school. She had to translate it into English at her grammar school. And she was the best in the class at those subjects. Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad  we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know  and they know it in their own language. When a language dies  we don't know what we lose with that language. This is    I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently    they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn't study at night in his village  like all the village children  because the kerosene lamp  it had smoke and it damaged his eyes. And anyway  there was never enough kerosene  because what does a dollar a day buy for you  So he invented a cost free solar lamp. And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home. When he received his award  he said these lovely words   The children can lead Africa from what it is today  a dark continent  to a light continent.  A simple idea  but it could have such far reaching consequences. People who have no light  whether it's physical or metaphorical  cannot pass our exams  and we can never know what they know. Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark. Let us celebrate diversity. Mind your language. Use it to spread great ideas. Thank you very much.\n",
      "I'm a lexicographer. I make dictionaries. And my job as a lexicographer is to try to put all the words possible  into the dictionary. My job is not to decide what a word is  that is your job. Everybody who speaks English  decides together what's a word and what's not a word. Every language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other. Now  sometimes when people are trying  to decide whether a word is good or bad  they don't really have a good reason. So they say something like   Because grammar   I don't actually really care about grammar too much    don't tell anybody. But the word  grammar   actually  there are two kinds of grammar. There's the kind of grammar that lives inside your brain  and if you're a native  speaker of a language or a good speaker of a language  it's the unconscious rules that you follow when you speak that language. And this is what you learn when you learn a language as a child. And here's an example  This is a wug  right  It's a wug. Now there is another one. There are two of these. There are two ... Audience  Wugs. Erin McKean  Exactly  You know  how to make the plural of wug. That rule lives in your brain. You never had to be taught this rule   you just understand it. This is an experiment that was invented by a professor at  Boston University  named Jean Berko Gleason back in     . So we've been talking about this  for a long time. Now  these kinds of natural rules  that exist in your brain  they're not like traffic laws  they're more like laws of nature. And nobody has to remind you to obey  a law of nature  right  When you leave the house in the morning   your mom doesn't say   Hey  honey  I think it's going to be cold  take a hoodie  don't forget to obey the law of gravity.  Nobody says this. Now  there are other rules that are more about manners than they are about nature. So you can think of a word as like a hat. Once you know how hats work  nobody has to tell you    Don't wear hats on your feet.  What they have to tell you is    Can you wear hats inside  Who gets to wear a hat  What are the kinds of hats you get to wear   Those are more of the second kind  of grammar  which linguists often call usage   as opposed to grammar. Now  sometimes people use this kind of  rules based grammar to discourage people from making up words. And I think that is  well  stupid. So  for example   people are always telling you   Be creative  make new music  do art   invent things  science and technology.  But when it comes to  words  they're like   Don't  No. Creativity stops right here  whippersnappers. Give it a rest.  But that makes no sense to me. Words are great. We should have more of them. I want you to make as many new words as possible. And I'm going to tell you six ways that you can use to make new words in English. The first way is the simplest way. Basically  steal them from other  languages.   Go rob other people    Laughter  Linguists call this borrowing  but we never give the words back   so I'm just going to be honest and call it stealing. We usually take words for things  that we like  like delicious food. We took  kumquat  from Chinese  we took  caramel  from French. We also take words  for cool things like  ninja   right  We took that from Japanese  which is kind of a cool trick because  ninjas are hard to steal from. So another way that you  can make words in English is by squishing two  other English words together. This is called compounding. Words in English are like Lego  If you use enough force   you can put any two of them together. We do this all the time in English  Words like  heartbroken    bookworm     sandcastle  all are compounds. So go ahead and make words like  duckface   just don't make duckface. Another way that you can make words  in English is kind of like compounding  but instead you use so much force when you squish the words together that some parts fall off. So these are blend words  like  brunch  is a blend  of  breakfast  and  lunch.   Motel  is a blend of  motor  and  hotel.  Who here knew that  motel   was a blend word  Yeah  that word is so old in English that lots of people don't know that  there are parts missing.  Edutainment  is a blend  of  education  and  entertainment.  And of course   electrocute  is a blend of  electric  and  execute.  You can also make words by changing how they operate. This is called functional shift. You take a word that acts  as one part of speech  and you change it into another  part of speech. Okay  who here knew that  friend  hasn't always been a verb   Friend  used to be noun  and then we verbed it. Almost any word in English can be verbed. You can also take adjectives  and make them into nouns.  Commercial  used to be an adjective  and now it's a noun. And of course  you can  green  things. Another way to make words in English is back formation. You can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit. So for example  in English we had the word  editor  before we had the word  edit.   Edit  was formed from  editor.  Sometimes these back formations  sound a little silly  Bulldozers bulldoze  butlers butle  and burglers burgle. Another way to make words in English is to take the first letters of something and squish them together. So National Aeronautics and Space  Administration becomes NASA. And of course you can do this  with anything  OMG  So it doesn't matter how silly  the words are. They can be really good words of English.  Absquatulate  is a perfectly  good word of English.  Mugwump  is a perfectly  good word of English. So the words don't have have to sound  normal  they can sound really silly. Why should you make words  You should make words because every word is a chance to express your idea and get  your meaning across. And new words grab people's attention. They get people to focus on what  you're saying and that gives you a better chance to get  your meaning across. A lot of people  on this stage today have said   In the future  you can do this  you can help with this  you can  help us explore  you can help us invent.  You can make a new word right now. English has no age limit. Go ahead  start making words today  send them to me  and I will put them  in my online dictionary  Wordnik. Thank you so much.\n",
      "Let's talk about manias. Let's start with Beatlemania. Hysterical teenagers  crying  screaming  pandemonium. Sports mania  deafening crowds  all for one idea    get the ball in the net. Okay  religious mania  there's rapture  there's weeping  there's visions. Manias can be good. Manias can be alarming. Or manias can be deadly. The world has a new mania. A mania for learning English. Listen as Chinese students practice their English  by screaming it  Teacher  ... change my life  Students  I want to change my life  T  I don't want to let my parents down  S  I don't want to let my parents down  T  I don't ever want to let my country down  S  I don't ever want to let my country down  T  Most importantly... S  Most importantly... T  I don't want to let myself down  S  I don't want to let myself down  How many people are trying to learn English worldwide  Two billion of them. Students  A t shirt. A dress. Jay Walker  In Latin America  in India  in Southeast Asia  and most of all  in China. If you're a Chinese student  you start learning English in the third grade  by law. That's why this year  China will become the world's largest English speaking country. Why English  In a single word  opportunity. Opportunity for a better life  a job  to be able to pay for school  or put better food on the table. Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days. Her score on this one test literally determines her future. She studies    hours a day for three years to prepare. Twenty five percent of her grade is based on English. It's called the gaokao  and    million high school Chinese students have already taken this grueling test. The intensity to learn English is almost unimaginable  unless you witness it. Teacher  Perfect  Students  Perfect  T  Perfect  S  Perfect  T  I want to speak perfect English  S  I want to speak perfect English  T  I want to speak ... S  I want to speak ... T  ... perfect English  S  ... perfect English  T  yelling more loudly   I want to change my life  S  yelling more loudly   I want to change my life  JW  So is English mania good or bad  Is English a tsunami  washing away other languages  Not likely. English is the world's second language. Your native language is your life. But with English you can become part of a wider conversation    a global conversation about global problems  like climate change or poverty  or hunger or disease. The world has other universal languages. Mathematics is the language of science. Music is the language of emotions. And now English is becoming the language of problem solving. Not because America is pushing it  but because the world is pulling it. So English mania is a turning point. Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities  or the fall of the Berlin Wall  English represents hope for a better future    a future where the world has a common language to solve its common problems. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Good morning  Are you awake  They took my name tag  but I wanted to ask you  did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic  Anyone  No one  All right  no problem. Once upon a time  not long ago  I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend  ordering food. So I looked at the waiter and said   Do you have a menu  Arabic    He looked at me strangely  thinking that he misheard. He said   Sorry   English .  I said   The menu  Arabic   please.  He replied   Don't you know what they call it    I do.  He said   No  It's called  menu   English   or  menu   French .  Is the French pronunciation correct   Come  come  take care of this one   said the waiter. He was disgusted when talking to me  as if he was saying to himself   If this was the last girl on Earth  I wouldn't look at her   What's the meaning of saying  menu  in Arabic  Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant. How could she speak that way  At that moment  I started thinking. It made me mad. It definitely hurts  I'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country  Where could this happen  How did we get here  Well  while we are here  there are many people like me  who would reach a stage in their lives  where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past  just so they can say that they're modern and civilized. Should I forget all my culture  thoughts  intellect and all my memories  Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war  Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic  just to conform  To be one of them  Where's the logic in that  Despite all that  I tried to understand him. I didn't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me. The Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs. It's not a language for science  research  a language we're used to in universities  a language we use in the workplace  a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project  and it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport. If we did so  they'd strip us of our clothes. Where can I use it  then  We could all ask this question  So  you want us to use Arabic. Where are we to do so  This is one reality. But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about. Arabic is the mother tongue. Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue. Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages. How  Gibran Khalil Gibran  when he first started writing  he used Arabic. All his ideas  imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up  smelling a specific smell  hearing a specific voice  and thinking a specific thought. So  when he started writing in English  he had enough baggage. Even when he wrote in English  when you read his writings in English  you smell the same smell  sense the same feeling. You can imagine that that's him writing in English  the same boy who came from the mountain. From a village on Mount Lebanon. So  this is an example no one can argue with. Second  it's often said that if you want to kill a nation  the only way to kill a nation  is to kill its language. This is a reality that developed societies are aware of. The Germans  French  Japanese and Chinese  all these nations are aware of this. That's why they legislate to protect their language. They make it sacred. That's why they use it in production  they pay a lot of money to develop it. Do we know better than them  All right  we aren't from the developed world  this advanced thinking hasn't reached us yet  and we would like to catch up with the civilized world. Countries that were once like us  but decided to strive for development  do research  and catch up with those countries  such as Turkey  Malaysia and others  they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder  protected it like a diamond. They kept it close to them. Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it's not labeled in Turkish  then it isn't a local product. You wouldn't believe it's a local product. They'd go back to being consumers  clueless consumers  like we are most of the time. So  in order for them to innovate and produce  they had to protect their language. If I say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence  Arabic    what does this remind you of  It doesn't ring a bell  does it  Regardless of the who  how and why. Language isn't just for conversing  just words coming out of our mouths. Language represents specific stages in our lives  and terminology that is linked to our emotions. So when we say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence   each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind  there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period. Language isn't one  two or three words or letters put together. It's an idea inside that relates to how we think  and how we see each other and how others see us. What is our intellect  How do you say whether this guy understands or not  So  if I say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence  English    or if your son came up to you and said   Dad  have you lived through the period of the freedom  English  slogan   How would you feel  If you don't see a problem  then I'd better leave  and stop talking in vain. The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing. I have a francophone friend who's married to a French man. I asked her once how things were going. She said   Everything is fine  but once  I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word 'toqborni' for him.  The poor woman had mistakenly told him  toqborni   and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him. He was puzzled by the thought   How could anyone be this cruel  Does she want to commit suicide  'Bury me '  English   This is one of the few examples. It made us feel that she's unable to tell that word to her husband  since he won't understand  and he's right not to  his way of thinking is different. She said to me   He listens to Fairuz with me  and one night  I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz.  The poor woman tried to translate this for him   From them I extended my hands and stole you     And here's the pickle   And because you belong to them  I returned my hands and left you.  Translate that for me. So  what have we done to protect the Arabic language  We turned this into a concern of the civil society  and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language. Even though many people told me   Why do you bother  Forget about this headache and go have fun.  No problem  The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says   I talk to you from the East  but you reply from the West.  We didn't say   No  We do not accept this or that.  We didn't adopt this style because that way  we wouldn't be understood. And when someone talks to me that way  I hate the Arabic language. We say   We want to change our reality  and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams  aspirations and day to day life. In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do. So   I talk to you from the East  but you reply from the West  has hit the spot. Something very easy  yet creative and persuasive. After that  we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground. You've seen an example of it outside  a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with  Don't kill your language   written on it. Why  Seriously  don't kill your language. We really shouldn't kill our language. If we were to kill the language  we'd have to find an identity. We'd have to find an existence. We'd go back to the beginning. This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized. After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter. Photos of  cool  guys and girls. We are very cool  And to whoever might say   Ha  You used an English word   I say   No  I adopt the word 'cool.'  Let them object however they want  but give me a word that's nicer and matches the reality better. I will keep on saying  Internet  I wouldn't say   I'm going to the world wide web  Because it doesn't fit  We shouldn't kid ourselves. But to reach this point  we all have to be convinced that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language  to control us or make us think and feel what they want. Creativity is the idea. So  if we can't reach space or build a rocket and so on  we can be creative. At this moment  every one of you is a creative project. Creativity in your mother tongue is the path. Let's start from this moment. Let's write a novel or produce a short film. A single novel could make us global again. It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one. So  it's not true that there's no solution  there is a solution  But we have to know that  and be convinced that a solution exists  that we have a duty to be part of that solution. In conclusion  what can you do today  Now  tweets  who's tweeting  Please  I beg of you  even though my time has finished  either Arabic  English  French or Chinese. But don't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers  It's a disaster  That's not a language. You'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language. It's not easy to come back from such a place and rise. That's the first thing we can do. Second  there are many other things that we can do. We're not here today to convince each other. We're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language. Now I will tell you a secret. A baby first identifies its father through language. When my daughter is born  I'll tell her   This is your father  honey  Arabic .  I wouldn't say   This is your dad  honey  English .  And in the supermarket  I promise my daughter Noor  that if she says to me   Thanks  Arabic    I won't say   Dis  'Merci  Maman '  and hope no one has heard her. Let's get rid of this cultural cringe.\n",
      "I need to start by telling you a little bit about my social life  which I know may not seem relevant  but it is. When people meet me at parties and they find out that I'm an English professor who specializes in language  they generally have one of two reactions. One set of people look frightened.  Laughter  They often say something like   Oh  I'd better be careful what I say. I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make.  And then they stop talking.  Laughter  And they wait for me to go away and talk to someone else. The other set of people  their eyes light up  and they say   You are just the person I want to talk to.  And then they tell me about whatever it is they think is going wrong with the English language. A couple of weeks ago  I was at a dinner party and the man to my right started telling me about all the ways that the Internet is degrading the English language. He brought up Facebook  and he said   To defriend  I mean  is that even a real word   I want to pause on that question  What makes a word real  My dinner companion and I both know what the verb  defriend  means  so when does a new word like  defriend  become real  Who has the authority to make those kinds of official decisions about words  anyway  Those are the questions I want to talk about today. I think most people  when they say a word isn't real  what they mean is  it doesn't appear in a standard dictionary. That  of course  raises a host of other questions  including  who writes dictionaries  Before I go any further  let me clarify my role in all of this. I do not write dictionaries. I do  however  collect new words much the way dictionary editors do  and the great thing about being a historian of the English language is that I get to call this  research.  When I teach the history of the English language  I require that students teach me two new slang words before I will begin class. Over the years  I have learned some great new slang this way  including  hangry   which    which is when you are cranky or angry because you are hungry  and  adorkable   which is when you are adorable in kind of a dorky way  clearly  terrific words that fill important gaps in the English language. But how real are they if we use them primarily as slang and they don't yet appear in a dictionary  With that  let's turn to dictionaries. I'm going to do this as a show of hands  How many of you still regularly refer to a dictionary  either print or online  Okay  so that looks like most of you. Now  a second question. Again  a show of hands  How many of you have ever looked to see who edited the dictionary you are using  Okay  many fewer. At some level  we know that there are human hands behind dictionaries  but we're really not sure who those hands belong to. I'm actually fascinated by this. Even the most critical people out there tend not to be very critical about dictionaries  not distinguishing among them and not asking a whole lot of questions about who edited them. Just think about the phrase  Look it up in the dictionary   which suggests that all dictionaries are exactly the same. Consider the library here on campus  where you go into the reading room  and there is a large  unabridged dictionary up on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect lying open so we can go stand before it to get answers. Now  don't get me wrong  dictionaries are fantastic resources  but they are human and they are not timeless. I'm struck as a teacher that we tell students to critically question every text they read  every website they visit  except dictionaries  which we tend to treat as un authored  as if they came from nowhere to give us answers about what words really mean. Here's the thing  If you ask dictionary editors  what they'll tell you is they're just trying to keep up with us as we change the language. They're watching what we say and what we write and trying to figure out what's going to stick and what's not going to stick. They have to gamble  because they want to appear cutting edge and catch the words that are going to make it  such as LOL  but they don't want to appear faddish and include the words that aren't going to make it  and I think a word that they're watching right now is YOLO  you only live once. Now I get to hang out with dictionary editors  and you might be surprised by one of the places where we hang out. Every January  we go to the American Dialect Society annual meeting  where among other things  we vote on the word of the year. There are about     or     people who come  some of the best known linguists in the United States. To give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting  it occurs right before happy hour. Anyone who comes can vote. The most important rule is that you can vote with only one hand. In the past  some of the winners have been  tweet  in      and  hashtag  in     .  Chad  was the word of the year in the year       because who knew what a chad was before       and  WMD  in     . Now  we have other categories in which we vote too  and my favorite category is most creative word of the year. Past winners in this category have included  recombobulation area   which is at the Milwaukee Airport after security  where you can recombobulate. You can put your belt back on  put your computer back in your bag. And then my all time favorite word at this vote  which is  multi slacking.  And multi slacking is the act of having multiple windows up on your screen so it looks like you're working when you're actually goofing around on the web. Will all of these words stick  Absolutely not. And we have made some questionable choices  for example in      when the word of the year was  Plutoed   to mean demoted. But some of the past winners now seem completely unremarkable  such as  app  and  e  as a prefix  and  google  as a verb. Now  a few weeks before our vote  Lake Superior State University issues its list of banished words for the year. What is striking about this is that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap between their list and the list that we are considering for words of the year  and this is because we're noticing the same thing. We're noticing words that are coming into prominence. It's really a question of attitude. Are you bothered by language fads and language change  or do you find it fun  interesting  something worthy of study as part of a living language  The list by Lake Superior State University continues a fairly long tradition in English of complaints about new words. So here is Dean Henry Alford in       who was very concerned that  desirability  is really a terrible word. In       Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter to David Hume giving up the word  colonize  as bad. Over the years  we've also seen worries about new pronunciations. Here is Samuel Rogers in      who is concerned about some fashionable pronunciations that he finds offensive  and he says  as if contemplate were not bad enough  balcony makes me sick.  The word is borrowed in from Italian and it was pronounced bal COE nee. These complaints now strike us as quaint  if not downright adorkable     Laughter     but here's the thing  we still get quite worked up about language change. I have an entire file in my office of newspaper articles which express concern about illegitimate words that should not have been included in the dictionary  including  LOL  when it got into the Oxford English Dictionary and  defriend  when it got into the Oxford American Dictionary. I also have articles expressing concern about  invite  as a noun   impact  as a verb  because only teeth can be impacted  and  incentivize  is described as  boorish  bureaucratic misspeak.  Now  it's not that dictionary editors ignore these kinds of attitudes about language. They try to provide us some guidance about words that are considered slang or informal or offensive  often through usage labels  but they're in something of a bind  because they're trying to describe what we do  and they know that we often go to dictionaries to get information about how we should use a word well or appropriately. In response  the American Heritage Dictionaries include usage notes. Usage notes tend to occur with words that are troublesome in one way  and one of the ways that they can be troublesome is that they're changing meaning. Now usage notes involve very human decisions  and I think  as dictionary users  we're often not as aware of those human decisions as we should be. To show you what I mean  we'll look at an example  but before we do  I want to explain what the dictionary editors are trying to deal with in this usage note. Think about the word  peruse  and how you use that word. I would guess many of you are thinking of skim  scan  reading quickly. Some of you may even have some walking involved  because you're perusing grocery store shelves  or something like that. You might be surprised to learn that if you look in most standard dictionaries  the first definition will be to read carefully  or pore over. American Heritage has that as the first definition. They then have  as the second definition  skim  and next to that  they say  usage problem.  And then they include a usage note  which is worth looking at. So here's the usage note   Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly'... But the word is often used more loosely  to mean simply 'to read.'... Further extension of the word to mean 'to glance over  skim ' has traditionally been considered an error  but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming somewhat more acceptable. When asked about the sentence  'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly '    percent of the  Usage  Panel found it unacceptable in          percent in       and    percent in     .  Ah  the Usage Panel  that trusted body of language authorities who is getting more lenient about this. Now  what I hope you're thinking right now is   Wait  who's on the Usage Panel  And what should I do with their pronouncements   If you look in the front matter of American Heritage Dictionaries  you can actually find the names of the people on the Usage Panel. But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries  There are about     people on the Usage Panel. They include academicians  journalists  creative writers. There's a Supreme Court justice on it and a few linguists. As of       the list includes me. Here's what we can do for you. We can give you a sense of the range of opinions about contested usage. That is and should be the extent of our authority. We are not a language academy. About once a year  I get a ballot that asks me about whether new uses  new pronunciations  new meanings  are acceptable. Now here's what I do to fill out the ballot. I listen to what other people are saying and writing. I do not listen to my own likes and dislikes about the English language. I will be honest with you  I do not like the word  impactful   but that is neither here nor there in terms of whether  impactful  is becoming common usage and becoming more acceptable in written prose. So to be responsible  what I do is go look at usage  which often involves going to look at online databases such as Google Books. Well  if you look for  impactful  in Google Books  here is what you find. Well  it sure looks like  impactful  is proving useful for a certain number of writers  and has become more and more useful over the last    years. Now  there are going to be changes that all of us don't like in the language. There are going to be changes where you think   Really  Does the language have to change that way   What I'm saying is  we should be less quick to decide that that change is terrible  we should be less quick to impose our likes and dislikes about words on other people  and we should be entirely reluctant to think that the English language is in trouble. It's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled with the creativity of the speakers who speak it. In retrospect  we think it's fascinating that the word  nice  used to mean silly  and that the word  decimate  used to mean to kill one in every   . We think that Ben Franklin was being silly to worry about  notice  as a verb. Well  you know what  We're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years for worrying about  impact  as a verb and  invite  as a noun. The language is not going to change so fast that we can't keep up. Language just doesn't work that way. I hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome but fun and fascinating  just the way dictionary editors do. I hope you can enjoy being part of the creativity that is continually remaking our language and keeping it robust. So how does a word get into a dictionary  It gets in because we use it and we keep using it  and dictionary editors are paying attention to us. If you're thinking   But that lets all of us decide what words mean   I would say   Yes it does  and it always has.  Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource  but there is no objective dictionary authority out there that is the final arbiter about what words mean. If a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means  it's real. That word might be slangy  that word might be informal  that word might be a word that you think is illogical or unnecessary  but that word that we're using  that word is real. Thank you.\n",

      "Today I'm going to speak to you about the last    years of architectural history. That's a lot to pack into    minutes. It's a complex topic  so we're just going to dive right in at a complex place  New Jersey. Because    years ago  I'm from Jersey  and I was six  and I lived there in my parents' house in a town called Livingston  and this was my childhood bedroom. Around the corner from my bedroom was the bathroom that I used to share with my sister. And in between my bedroom and the bathroom was a balcony that overlooked the family room. And that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV  so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom  everyone would see me  and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel  everyone would see me. And I looked like this. I was awkward  insecure  and I hated it. I hated that walk  I hated that balcony  I hated that room  and I hated that house. And that's architecture. Done. That feeling  those emotions that I felt  that's the power of architecture  because architecture is not about math and it's not about zoning  it's about those visceral  emotional connections that we feel to the places that we occupy. And it's no surprise that we feel that way  because according to the EPA  Americans spend    percent of their time indoors. That's    percent of our time surrounded by architecture. That's huge. That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize. That makes us a little bit gullible and very  very predictable. It means that when I show you a building like this  I know what you think  You think  power  and  stability  and  democracy.  And I know you think that because it's based on a building that was build       years ago by the Greeks. This is a trick. This is a trigger that architects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of. It's a predictable emotional connection  and we've been using this trick for a long  long time. We used it       years ago to build banks. We used it in the   th century to build art museums. And in the   th century in America  we used it to build houses. And look at these solid  stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements. This is really  really useful  because building things is terrifying. It's expensive  it takes a long time  and it's very complicated. And the people that build things    developers and governments    they're naturally afraid of innovation  and they'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respond to. That's how we end up with buildings like this. This is a nice building. This is the Livingston Public Library that was completed in      in my hometown  and  you know  it's got a dome and it's got this round thing  and columns  red brick  and you can kind of guess what Livingston is trying to say with this building  children  property values and history. But it doesn't have much to do with what a library actually does today. That same year  in       on the other side of the country  another library was completed  and it looks like this. It's in Seattle. This library is about how we consume media in a digital age. It's about a new kind of public amenity for the city  a place to gather and read and share. So how is it possible that in the same year  in the same country  two buildings  both called libraries  look so completely different  And the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum. On the one side is innovation  and architects are constantly pushing  pushing for new technologies  new typologies  new solutions for the way that we live today. And we push and we push and we push until we completely alienate all of you. We wear all black  we get very depressed  you think we're adorable  we're dead inside because we've got no choice. We have to go to the other side and reengage those symbols that we know you love. So we do that  and you're happy  we feel like sellouts  so we start experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth we've gone for the last     years  and certainly for the last    years. Okay     years ago we were coming out of the '  s. Architects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism. It's about concrete. You can guess this. Small windows  dehumanizing scale. This is really tough stuff. So as we get closer to the '  s  we start to reengage those symbols. We push the pendulum back into the other direction. We take these forms that we know you love and we update them. We add neon and we add pastels and we use new materials. And you love it. And we can't give you enough of it. We take Chippendale armoires and we turned those into skyscrapers  and skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass. Forms got big  forms got bold and colorful. Dwarves became columns. Swans grew to the size of buildings. It was crazy. But it's the '  s  it's cool. We're all hanging out in malls and we're all moving to the suburbs  and out there  out in the suburbs  we can create our own architectural fantasies. And those fantasies  they can be Mediterranean or French or Italian. Possibly with endless breadsticks. This is the thing about postmodernism. This is the thing about symbols. They're easy  they're cheap  because instead of making places  we're making memories of places. Because I know   and I know all of you know  this isn't Tuscany. This is Ohio. So architects get frustrated  and we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction. In the late '  s and early '  s  we start experimenting with something called deconstructivism. We throw out historical symbols  we rely on new  computer aided design techniques  and we come up with new compositions  forms crashing into forms. This is academic and heady stuff  it's super unpopular  we totally alienate you. Ordinarily  the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction. And then  something amazing happened. In       this building opened. This is the Guggenheim Bilbao  by Frank Gehry. And this building fundamentally changes the world's relationship to architecture. Paul Goldberger said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critics  academics  and the general public were completely united around a building. The New York Times called this building a miracle. Tourism in Bilbao increased       percent after this building was completed. So all of a sudden  everybody wants one of these buildings  L.A.  Seattle  Chicago  New York  Cleveland  Springfield. Everybody wants one  and Gehry is everywhere. He is our very first starchitect. Now  how is it possible that these forms    they're wild and radical    how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world  And it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism. We created an emotional reaction to these forms. So did every mayor in the world. So every mayor knew that if they had these forms  they had culture and tourism. This phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium happened to a few other starchitects. It happened to Zaha and it happened to Libeskind  and what happened to these elite few architects at the turn of the new millennium could actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture  as digital media starts to increase the speed with which we consume information. Because think about how you consume architecture. A thousand years ago  you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building. Transportation speeds up  You can take a boat  you can take a plane  you can be a tourist. Technology speeds up  You can see it in a newspaper  on TV  until finally  we are all architectural photographers  and the building has become disembodied from the site. Architecture is everywhere now  and that means that the speed of communication has finally caught up to the speed of architecture. Because architecture actually moves quite quickly. It doesn't take long to think about a building. It takes a long time to build a building  three or four years  and in the interim  an architect will design two or eight or a hundred other buildings before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not. That's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture. That's how we end up with buildings like this. Brutalism wasn't a two year movement  it was a    year movement. For    years  we were producing buildings like this because we had no idea how much you hated it. It's never going to happen again  I think  because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete  of steel  or of the elevator  and it's a media revolution. So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum  it starts swinging faster and faster  until it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously  and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol  between us  the architects  and you  the public. Now we can make nearly instantaneous  emotionally charged symbols out of something that's brand new. Let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed. We were hired to replace this building  which burned down. This is the center of a town called the Pines in Fire Island in New York State. It's a vacation community. We proposed a building that was audacious  that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to  and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared  so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Instagram  and we let people start to do what they do  share it  comment  like it  hate it. But that meant that two years before the building was complete  it was already a part of the community  so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product  there were no surprises. This building was already a part of this community  and then that first summer  when people started arriving and sharing the building on social media  the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media  because these  these are not just pictures of a building  they're your pictures of a building. And as you use them to tell your story  they become part of your personal narrative  and what you're doing is you're short circuiting all of our collective memory  and you're making these charged symbols for us to understand. That means we don't need the Greeks anymore to tell us what to think about architecture. We can tell each other what we think about architecture  because digital media hasn't just changed the relationship between all of us  it's changed the relationship between us and buildings. Think for a second about those librarians back in Livingston. If that building was going to be built today  the first thing they would do is go online and search  new libraries.  They would be bombarded by examples of experimentation  of innovation  of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be. That's ammunition. That's ammunition that they can take with them to the mayor of Livingston  to the people of Livingston  and say  there's no one answer to what a library is today. Let's be a part of this. This abundance of experimentation gives them the freedom to run their own experiment. Everything is different now. Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings  and you aren't the hapless public  the consumer that won't accept anything that they haven't seen anymore. Architects can hear you  and you're not intimidated by architecture. That means that that pendulum swinging back and forth from style to style  from movement to movement  is irrelevant. We can actually move forward and find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces. This is the end of architectural history  and it means that the buildings of tomorrow are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today. It means that a public space in the ancient city of Seville can be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works. It means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn  not some red brick historical pastiche of what we think a stadium ought to be. It means that robots are going to build our buildings  because we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produce. And it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature instead of the other way around. It means that a parking garage in Miami Beach  Florida  can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night. It means that three architects can dream about swimming in the East River of New York  and then raise nearly half a million dollars from a community that gathered around their cause  no one client anymore. It means that no building is too small for innovation  like this little reindeer pavilion that's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe. And it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful to be lovable  like this ugly little building in Spain  where the architects dug a hole  packed it with hay  and then poured concrete around it  and when the concrete dried  they invited someone to come and clean that hay out so that all that's left when it's done is this hideous little room that's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made  and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset. Because it doesn't matter if a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings. It doesn't matter how we build  it matters what we build. Architects already know how to make buildings that are greener and smarter and friendlier. We've just been waiting for all of you to want them. And finally  we're not on opposite sides anymore. Find an architect  hire an architect  work with us to design better buildings  better cities  and a better world  because the stakes are high. Buildings don't just reflect our society  they shape our society down to the smallest spaces  the local libraries  the homes where we raise our children  and the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom. Thank you.\n",
      "For much of the past century  architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine.  Form follows function  had become modernity's ambitious manifesto and detrimental straitjacket  as it liberated architecture from the decorative  but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose. Of course  architecture is about function  but I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi  and I want to propose a completely different quality. If form follows fiction  we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories    stories of the people that live there  of the people that work in these buildings. And we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create. In this sense  I'm interested in fiction not as the implausible but as the real  as the reality of what architecture means for the people that live in it and with it. Our buildings are prototypes  ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different  and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today. Our buildings are real  they're being built. They're an explicit engagement in physical reality and conceptual possibility. I think of our architecture as organizational structures. At their core is indeed structural thinking  like a system  How can we arrange things in both a functional and experiential way  How can we create structures that generate a series of relationships and narratives  And how can fictive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture  while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time  And here comes the second term into play  what I call  narrative hybrids     structures of multiple simultaneous stories that unfold throughout the buildings we create. So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships  both in a programmatic and functional way and in an experiential and emotive or social way. This is the headquarters for China's national broadcaster  which I designed together with Rem Koolhaas at OMA. When I first arrived in Beijing in       the city planners showed us this image  a forest of several hundred skyscrapers to emerge in the central business district  except at that time  only a handful of them existed. So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about  except one thing  it would all be about verticality. Of course  the skyscraper is vertical    it's a profoundly hierarchical structure  the top always the best  the bottom the worst  and the taller you are  the better  so it seems. And we wanted to ask ourselves  could a building be about a completely different quality  Could it undo this hierarchy  and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration  rather than isolation  So we took this needle and bent it back into itself  into a loop of interconnected activities. Our idea was to bring all aspects of television making into one single structure  news  program production  broadcasting  research and training  administration    all into a circuit of interconnected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration. I still very much like this image. It reminds one of biology classes  if you remember the human body with all its organs and circulatory systems  like at school. And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance  but as an organism  as a life form. And as you start to dissect this organism  you can identify a series of primary technical clusters    program production  broadcasting center and news. Those are tightly intertwined with social clusters  meeting rooms  canteens  chat areas    informal spaces for people to meet and exchange. So the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social  the human and the performative. And of course  we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system  to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity. With         square meters  it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world. It has a population of over        people  and of course  this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension of many things and the scale of typical architecture. So we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut        little sticks and glued them onto a model  just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant. But of course  it's not a number  it is the people  it is a community that inhabits the building  and in order to both comprehend this  but also script this architecture  we identified five characters  hypothetical characters  and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building  thought of where they would meet  what they would experience. So it was a way to script and design the building  but of course  also to communicate its experiences. This was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art in both New York and Beijing. This is the main broadcast control room  a technical installation so large  it can broadcast over     channels simultaneously. And this is how the building stands in Beijing today. Its first broadcast live was the London Olympics       after it had been completed from the outside for the Beijing Olympics. And you can see at the very tip of this    meter cantilever  those three little circles. And they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building. They're a piece of glass that you can stand on and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion. The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing. It is there. It has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography. But its most important moment is maybe sill this one.  That's Beijing  is similar to  Time Out   a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week  and suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter  but actually as an urban actor  as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city. So architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player  of something that writes stories and performs stories. And I think that could be one of its primary meanings that we believe in. But of course  there's another story to this building. It is the story of the people that made it        engineers and architects that I was guiding over almost a decade of collaborative work that we spent together in scripting this building  in imagining its reality and ultimately getting it built in China. This is a residential development in Singapore  large scale. If we look at Singapore like most of Asia and more and more of the world  of course  it is dominated by the tower  a typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness  and I wanted to ask  how could we think about living  not only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves and our apartment  but in an idea of a collective  How could we think about creating a communal environment in which sharing things was as great as having your own  The typical answer to the question    we had to design       apartments    would have looked like this     story height limit given by the planning authorities     towers with nothing but residual in between    a very tight system that  although the tower isolates you  it doesn't even give you privacy  because you're so close to the next one  that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be. So I proposed to topple the towers  throw the vertical into the horizontal and stack them up  and what looks a bit random from the side  if you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter  you can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid  in which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up to create huge outdoor courtyards    central spaces for the community  programmed with a variety of amenities and functions. And you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces. They're open  permeable  they're interconnected. We called the project  The Interlace   thinking that we interlace and interconnect the human beings and the spaces alike. And the detailed quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants. And  in fact  it was a system where we would layer primarily communal spaces  stacked to more and more individual and private spaces. So we would open up a spectrum between the collective and the individual. A little piece of math  if we count all the green that we left on the ground  minus the footprint of the buildings  and we would add back the green of all the terraces  we have     percent green space  so more nature than not having built a building. And of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying the space available to those who live there. This is  in fact  the   th floor of one of these terraces. So you see new datum planes  new grounds planes for social activity. We paid a lot of attention to sustainability. In the tropics  the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to  and  in fact  it is seeking protection from the sun. We first proved that all apartments would have sufficient daylight through the year. We then went on to optimize the glazing of the facades to minimize the energy consumption of the building. But most importantly  we could prove that through the geometry of the building design  the building itself would provide sufficient shading to the courtyards so that those would be usable throughout the entire year. We further placed water bodies along the prevailing wind corridors  so that evaporative cooling would create microclimates that  again  would enhance the quality of those spaces available for the inhabitants. And it was the idea of creating this variety of choices  of freedom to think where you would want to be  where you would want to escape  maybe  within the own complexity of the complex in which you live. But coming from Asia to Europe  a building for a German media company based in Berlin  transitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media. And its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions  Why would anyone today still want to go to the office  because you can actually work anywhere  And how could a digital identity of a company be embodied in a building  We created not only an object  but at the center of this object we created a giant space  and this space was about the experience of a collective  the experience of collaboration and of togetherness. Communication  interaction as the center of a space that in itself would float  like what we call the collaborative cloud  in the middle of the building  surrounded by an envelope of standard modular offices. So with only a few steps from your quiet work desk  you could participate in the giant collective experience of the central space. Finally  we come to London  a project commissioned by the London Legacy Development Corporation of the Mayor of London. We were asked to undertake a study and investigate the potential of a site out in Stratford in the Olympic Park. In the   th century  Prince Albert had created Albertopolis. And Boris Johnson thought of creating Olympicopolis. The idea was to bring together some of Britain's greatest institutions  some international ones  and to create a new system of synergies. Prince Albert  as yet  created Albertopolis in the   th century  thought of showcasing all achievements of mankind  bringing arts and science closer together. And he built Exhibition Road  a linear sequence of those institutions. But of course  today's society has moved on from there. We no longer live in a world in which everything is as clearly delineated or separated from each other. We live in a world in which boundaries start to blur between the different domains  and in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important than keeping separations. So we wanted to think of a giant culture machine  a building that would orchestrate and animate the various domains  but allow them to interact and collaborate. At the base of it is a very simple module  a ring module. It can function as a double loaded corridor  has daylight  has ventilation. It can be glazed over and turned into a giant exhibitional performance space. These modules were stacked together with the idea that almost any function could  over time  occupy any of these modules. So institutions could shrink or contract  as  of course  the future of culture is  in a way  the most uncertain of all. This is how the building sits  adjacent to the Aquatics Centre  opposite the Olympic Stadium. And you can see how its cantilevering volumes project out and engage the public space and how its courtyards animate the public inside. The idea was to create a complex system in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity  in which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume. Here's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris. It both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project  but also the difference  here  it is a multiplicity of a heterogeneous structure  in which different entities can interact without losing their own identity. And it was this thought  to create an organizational structure that would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted    for those in the educational parts that create and think culture  for those that present the visual arts  the dance  and for the public to be admitted into all of this with a series of possible trajectories  to script their own reading of these narratives and their own experience. And I want to end on a project that is very small  in a way  very different  a floating cinema in the ocean of Thailand. Friends of mine had founded a film festival  and I thought  if we think of the stories and narratives of movies  we should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them. So I designed a small modular floating platform  based on the techniques of local fishermen  how they built their lobster and fish farms. We collaborated with the local community and built  out of recycled materials of their own  this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films from the British film archive          Alice in Wonderland   for example. The most primordial experiences of the audience merged with the stories of the movies. So I believe that architecture exceeds the domain of physical matter  of the built environment  but is really about how we want to live our lives  how we script our own stories and those of others. Thank you.\n",
      "I'll start with my favorite muse  Emily Dickinson  who said that wonder is not knowledge  neither is it ignorance. It's something which is suspended between what we believe we can be  and a tradition we may have forgotten. And I think  when I listen to these incredible people here  I've been so inspired    so many incredible ideas  so many visions. And yet  when I look at the environment outside  you see how resistant architecture is to change. You see how resistant it is to those very ideas. We can think them out. We can create incredible things. And yet  at the end  it's so hard to change a wall. We applaud the well mannered box. But to create a space that never existed is what interests me  to create something that has never been  a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits. And I think that's really what architecture is based on. Architecture is not based on concrete and steel and the elements of the soil. It's based on wonder. And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities  the greatest spaces that we have had. And I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story. By the way  it is a story that is told through its hard materials. But it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities. If you think of the great buildings  of the cathedrals  of the temples  of the pyramids  of pagodas  of cities in India and beyond  you think of how incredible this is that that was realized not by some abstract idea  but by people. So  anything that has been made can be unmade. Anything that has been made can be made better. There it is  the things that I really believe are of important architecture. These are the dimensions that I like to work with. It's something very personal. It's not  perhaps  the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners. But I think these are the necessary oxygen for us to live in buildings  to live in cities  to connect ourselves in a social space. And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward. It's the only profession where you have to believe in the future. You can be a general  a politician  an economist who is depressed  a musician in a minor key  a painter in dark colors. But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better. And it is that belief that I think drives society. And today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us. And yet it is in times like this that I think architecture can thrive with big ideas  ideas that are not small. Think of the great cities. Think of the Empire State Building  the Rockefeller Center. They were built in times that were not really the best of times in a certain way. And yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy. So again  I am a believer in the expressive. I have never been a fan of the neutral. I don't like neutrality in life  in anything. I think expression. And it's like espresso coffee  you know  you take the essence of the coffee. That's what expression is. It's been missing in much of the architecture  because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered  the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion  that has no value. And yet  I believe it is the expression    expression of the city  expression of our own space    that gives meaning to architecture. And  of course  expressive spaces are not mute. Expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know. Expressive spaces may disturb us. And I think that's also part of life. Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile  but to reach out across the abyss of history  to places we have never been  and would have perhaps been  had we not been so lucky. So again  radical versus conservative. Radical  what does it mean  It's something which is rooted  and something which is rooted deep in a tradition. And I think that is what architecture is  it's radical. It's not just a conservation in formaldehyde of dead forms. It is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of  and a story that is certainly ongoing. It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending. It's actually a story in which our acts themselves are pushing the story in a particular way. So again I am a believer in the radical architecture. You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation. It's like the old Las Vegas used to be. It's about conserving emotions  conserving the traditions that have obstructed the mind in moving forward and of course what is radical is to confront them. And I think our architecture is a confrontation with our own senses. Therefore I believe it should not be cool. There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture. I've always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed. Life without emotion would really not be life. Even the mind is emotional. There is no reason which does not take a position in the ethical sphere  in the philosophical mystery of what we are. So I think emotion is a dimension that is important to introduce into city space  into city life. And of course  we are all about the struggle of emotions. And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place. And of course  the confrontation of the cool  the unemotional with emotion  is a conversation that I think cities themselves have fostered. I think that is the progress of cities. It's not only the forms of cities  but the fact that they incarnate emotions  not just of those who build them  but of those who live there as well. Inexplicable versus understood. You know  too often we want to understand everything. But architecture is not the language of words. It's a language. But it is not a language that can be reduced to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write. Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story  but the story is very short  which says   We have no story to tell you.  So the important thing actually  is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions  which might be totally inexplicable in words  because they operate in proportions  in materials  in light. They connect themselves into various sources  into a kind of complex vector matrix that isn't really frontal but is really embedded in the lives  and in the history of a city  and of a people. So again  the notion that a building should just be explicit I think is a false notion  which has reduced architecture into banality. Hand versus the computer. Of course  what would we be without computers  Our whole practice depends on computing. But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand  the hand should really be the driver of the computing power. Because I believe that the hand in all its primitive  in all its physiological obscurity  has a source  though the source is unknown  though we don't have to be mystical about it. We realize that the hand has been given us by forces that are beyond our own autonomy. And I think when I draw drawings which may imitate the computer  but are not computer drawings    drawings that can come from sources that are completely not known  not normal  not seen  yet the hand    and that's what I really  to all of you who are working    how can we make the computer respond to our hand rather than the hand responding to the computer. I think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is. Because certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda that the simple is the good. But I don't believe it. Listening to all of you  the complexity of thought  the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming. And I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture  You know  brain surgery  atomic theory  genetics  economics are complex complex fields. There is no reason that architecture should shy away and present this illusory world of the simple. It is complex. Space is complex. Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds. And as wondrous as it is  it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification that we have often come to be admired. And yet  our lives are complex. Our emotions are complex. Our intellectual desires are complex. So I do believe that architecture as I see it needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have  in every intimacy that we possess. Of course that means that architecture is political. The political is not an enemy of architecture. The politeama is the city. It's all of us together. And I've always believed that the act of architecture  even a private house  when somebody else will see it  is a political act  because it will be visible to others. And we live in a world which is connecting us more and more. So again  the evasion of that sphere  which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture  the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object has never appealed to me. And I do believe that this interaction with the history  with history that is often very difficult  to grapple with it  to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique. Because architecture is also the asking of questions. It's not only the giving of answers. It's also  just like life  the asking of questions. Therefore it is important that it be real. You know we can simulate almost anything. But the one thing that can be ever simulated is the human heart  the human soul. And architecture is so closely intertwined with it because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere. So the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual. It's not something that comes to us from books and theories. It's the real that we touch    the door  the window  the threshold  the bed    such prosaic objects. And yet  I try  in every building  to take that virtual world  which is so enigmatic and so rich  and create something in the real world. Create a space for an office  a space of sustainability that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real. Unexpected versus habitual. What is a habit  It's just a shackle for ourselves. It's a self induced poison. So the unexpected is always unexpected. You know  it's true  the cathedrals  as unexpected  will always be unexpected. You know Frank Gehry's buildings  they will continue to be unexpected in the future. So not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability  but an architecture that is full of tension  an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart  and that breaks out of the shackles of habits. And of course habits are enforced by architecture. When we see the same kind of architecture we become immured in that world of those angles  of those lights  of those materials. We think the world really looks like our buildings. And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders that have been part of them. So again  the unexpected which is also the raw. And I often think of the raw and the refined. What is raw  The raw  I would say is the naked experience  untouched by luxury  untouched by expensive materials  untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture. So the rawness  I think  in space  the fact that sustainability can actually  in the future translate into a raw space  a space that isn't decorated  a space that is not mannered in any source  but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature  might be refractive to our desires. A space that doesn't always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us  but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities  other experiences  that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture. And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy. And so I do like something which is pointed  not blunt  something which is focused on reality  something that has the power  through its leverage  to transform even a very small space. So architecture maybe is not so big  like science  but through its focal point it can leverage in an Archimedian way what we think the world is really about. And often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done  what has been done  how the world has remained both in between stability and instability. And of course buildings have their shapes. Those shapes are difficult to change. And yet  I do believe that in every social space  in every public space  there is a desire to communicate more than just that blunt thought  that blunt technique  but something that pinpoints  and can point in various directions forward  backward  sideways and around. So that is indeed what is memory. So I believe that my main interest is to memory. Without memory we would be amnesiacs. We would not know which way we were going  and why we are going where we're going. So I've been never interested in the forgettable reuse  rehashing of the same things over and over again  which  of course  get accolades of critics. Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way. But I rather play something completely unheard of  and even with flaws  than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness. So again  memory is the city  memory is the world. Without the memory there would be no story to tell. There would be nowhere to turn. The memorable  I think  is really our world  what we think the world is. And it's not only our memory  but those who remember us  which means that architecture is not mute. It's an art of communication. It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires. It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available. It can reach into millennia that have been buried  and return them in a just and unexpected equity. So again  I think the notion that the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me. Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city. Cities should be full of vibrations  full of sound  full of music. And that indeed is the architectural mission that I believe is important  is to create spaces that are vibrant  that are pluralistic  that can transform the most prosaic activities  and raise them to a completely different expectation. Create a shopping center  a swimming place that is more like a museum than like entertainment. And these are our dreams. And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky. You know it costs a lot of money and so on  but yes  it should not play it safe. It should not play it safe  because if it plays it safe it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be. And I think  of course  risk is what underlies the world. World without risk would not be worth living. So yes  I do believe that the risk we take in every building. Risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent. Risks of spaces that have never been so dizzying  as they should be  for a pioneering city. Risks that really move architecture even with all its flaws  into a space which is much better that the ever again repeated hollowness of a ready made thing. And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be. It's about space. It's not about fashion. It's not about decoration. It's about creating with minimal means something which can not be repeated  cannot be simulated in any other sphere. And there of course is the space that we need to breathe  is the space we need to dream. These are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us  but are important for everybody in this world. So again  it's not about the changing fashions  changing theories. It's about carving out a space for trees. It's carving out a space where nature can enter the domestic world of a city. A space where something which has never seen a light of day can enter into the inner workings of a density. And I think that is really the nature of architecture. Now I am a believer in democracy. I don't like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes. Where people cannot speak  cannot vote  cannot do anything. We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful. And yet when I think of the poverty of society which doesn't give freedom to its people  I don't admire those buildings. So democracy  as difficult as it is  I believe in it. And of course  at Ground Zero what else  It's such a complex project. It's emotional. There is so many interests. It's political. There is so many parties to this project. There is so many interests. There's money. There's political power. There are emotions of the victims. And yet  in all its messiness  in all its difficulties  I would not have liked somebody to say   This is the tabula rasa  mister architect    do whatever you want.  I think nothing good will come out of that. I think architecture is about consensus. And it is about the dirty word  compromise.  Compromise is not bad. Compromise  if it's artistic  if it is able to cope with its strategies    and there is my first sketch and the last rendering    it's not that far away. And yet  compromise  consensus  that is what I believe in. And Ground Zero  despite all its difficulties  it's moving forward. It's difficult.           . Freedom Tower  the memorial. And that is where I end. I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others  looking at America from that point of view. This is America. This is liberty. This is what we dream about. Its individuality  demonstrated in the skyline. It's resilience. And finally  it's the freedom that America represents  not just to me  as an immigrant  but to everyone in the world. Thank you. Chris Anderson  I've got a question. So have you come to peace with the process that happened at Ground Zero and the loss of the original  incredible design that you came up with  Daniel Libeskind  Look. We have to cure ourselves of the notion that we are authoritarian  that we can determine everything that happens. We have to rely on others  and shape the process in the best way possible. I came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser  not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight. You have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win everything you want to win. But you can steer the process. And I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero will be meaningful  will be inspiring  will tell other generations of the sacrifices  of the meaning of this event. Not just for New York  but for the world. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much  Daniel Libeskind.\n",
      "I don't know your name. Audience Member  Howard. Howard. Thom Mayne  Howard  I'm sitting next to Howard. I don't know Howard  obviously  and he's going  I hope you're not next. Amazing. Amazing performance. I kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that. Let me start some place. I'm interested    I kind of do the same thing  but I don't move my body.  Laughter  And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space  I work in the mineral world. I work with more or less inert matter. And I organize it. And  well  it's also a bit different because an architect versus  let's say  a dance company finally is a negotiation between one's private world  one's conceptual world  the world of ideas  the world of aspirations  of inventions  with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations  the naysayers. Because I have to say  for my whole career  if there's anything that's been consistent  it's been that you can't do it. No matter what I've done  what I've tried to do  everybody says it can't be done. And it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas. And to be an architect  somehow you have to negotiate between left and right  and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world  and then make it understood. I can start any number of places  because this process is also    I think    very different from some of the morning sessions  which you had such a kind of very clear  such a lineal idea  like the last one  say  with Howard  that I think the creative process in architecture  the design process  is extremely circuitous. It's labyrinthine. It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line  not the straight line. And definitely my life has been part of that. I'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things. But basically  what we do is  we try to give coherence to the world. We make physical things  buildings that become a part in an accretional process  they make cities. And those things are the reflection of the processes  and the time that they are made. And what I'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world and the territories which are useful as generative material. Because  really  all I'm interested in  always  as an architect  is the way things are produced because that's what I do. Right  And it's not based on an a priori notion. I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain and saying   This is what it looks like.  In fact  somebody mentioned    Ewan  maybe it was you in your introduction    about this is what architects    did somebody say it's what business people come to  it's what the corporate world comes to when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line  Huh. Wow. It doesn't work that way for me at all. I have no interest in that whatsoever. Architecture is the beginning of something  because it's    if you're not involved in first principles  if you're not involved in the absolute  the beginning of that generative process  it's cake decoration. And I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators  if anybody's involved in cake decorations    it's not what I'm interested in doing.  Laughter  And so  in the formation of things  in giving it form  in concretizing these things  it starts with some notion of how one organizes. And I've had for    years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear  and to understand the nature of the final result of that  representing the building itself. There's been a continual relationship between inventions  which are private  and reality  which has been important to me. A project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen    years ago  which was the modeling of a hippocampus    the territory of the brain that records short term memory    and the documentation of that  the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience. And it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer  observing every kilometer a particular object of desire  and then placing that within this. And the notion was that I could make an organization not built on normal coherencies  but built on non sequiturs  built on randomness. And I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city  an accretional notion of the city  and that led to various ideas of organization. And then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity of systems. And it's not any single system that makes the work. It's the relationship    it's the dynamics between the systems    which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture that is    that would otherwise not exist. And those systems could be identified  and they could be grouped together. And of course  today  with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping  etc.  we have the mechanisms to understand and to respond to these systems  and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities because that's all we do. We're producing spaces that accommodate human activity. And what I'm interested in is not the styling of that  but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity. And that directly connects to ideas of city making. This is a project that we just finished in Penang for a very  very large city project that came directly out of this process  which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it. And the project    again  enormous  enormous competition    on the Hudson River and in New York that we were asked to do three years ago  which uses these processes. And what you're looking at are possibilities that have to do with the generation of the city as one applies a methodology that uses notions of these multiple forces  that deals with the enormity of the problem  the complexity of the problem  when we're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates. Because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate  and as the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems. And that led us directly to the Olympic Village. I was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC. We won the competition    what was it  nine months ago  Again  a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated  very large scale organisms. And then  also  was working with broad strategies. In this case  we only used    of the    acres of land  and the    acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village. And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs  etc. Its position  of course  in the middle of Manhattan    it's on Hunter's Point. And then the broader ideas of city making start having direct influences on architecture  on the elements that make up the broader scheme  the buildings themselves  and start guiding us. Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place. And so I can start this discussion in any number of places  and I've chosen three or four to talk about. And it has also to do with an interest in the vast kind of territory that architecture touches. It literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base. There's just no place that it doesn't somehow have a connective tissue to. This is Jim Dine  and it's the absence of presence  etc. It's the clothing  the skin  without the presence of the character. It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work  and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface  and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very  kind of complex space. And the idea was the relationship of the space  which was made up of the fold of the image  and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration  and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space  which were in dialog. And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things  and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces  and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations. And this was the first prototype in Korea  as we're dealing with a dynamic envelope  and then the same characteristic of the fabric. It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous  and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is. And that turned right away into another project. This is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles. And now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated. Again  it's a very  very simple notion. If you look at most buildings  what you look at is the building  the facade  and it is the building. And all of a sudden we're kind of moving away  and we're separating the skin from the body  and that's going to lead to broader performance criteria  which I'm going to talk about in a minute. And you're looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body. And then  again  the building itself  middle of Los Angeles  right across from City Hall. And as it moves  it takes pieces of the earth with it. It bends up. It's part of a sign system  which was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles    the two dimension  three dimension signing  etc. And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself. It's transparent  and it allows you to understand  I think  what is always the most interesting thing in any building  which is the actual constructional processes that make it. And it's probably the most intense kind of territory of the work  which is not occupied  because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism when it's separated from function  and this is an area that allows for that. And then the skin starts transforming into other materials. We're using light as a building material in this case. We're working with Keith Sonnier in New York  and we're making this large outside room  which is possible in Los Angeles  and which is very much reflective of the urban  the contemporary urban environments that you would find in Shibuya or you'd find in Mexico City or Sao Paulo  etc.  that have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time. And that was very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles. And  again  all of it promoting transparency. And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium  that light becomes literally a building material. Well  that immediately turned into something much broader  and as a scope. And again  we're looking at an early sketch where I'm understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower. This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction. And now it turned into something much  much broader as a problem  and it has to do with performance. This will be the first building in the United States that took    well  I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid. I wanted a pure thing  and I can't get it. It's a wrong attitude  actually  because the hybrid is probably more interesting. But we took the air conditioning out of the tower. There's some air conditioning left in the base  but the skin now moves on hydraulics. It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind. It adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning. Huge  huge thing. Half a million dollars a year delta.    of these    it's just under a million square feet        and some thousand square feet       of these would power Sausalito    the delta on this. And so now what we're looking at  as the projects get larger in scale  as they interface with broader problems  that they expand the capabilities in terms of their performance. Well  I could also start here. We could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground. Well  our research    my generation for sure  people who were going to school in the late '  s    made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture  looking at architecture within its own territory  and we were much more affected by film  by what was going on in the art world  etc. This is  of course  Michael Heizer. And when I saw this  first an image and then visited  it completely changed the way I thought after that point. And I understood that building really could be the augmentation of the Earth's surface  and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense. And then    well  he was probably looking at this    this is Nazca  this is     years ago    the most amazing four kilometer land sculptures. They're just totally incredible. And that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw  how we work. This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona    well  whatever it is  a model  a conceptual  kind of idea. And it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable. So it puts         square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth. There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work. And there it is  again  as it's starting to get resolved tectonically  and then there's the school. And  of course  we're interested in participating with education. I have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates X  Y and Z function. What I'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people. It demands some sort of notion of inquiry because it's a system that's developed not sculpturally. It's an idea that started from my first discussion. It has to do with a broad  consistent logic  and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building. And there's an overt    at least  there's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem  as one would understand that. And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles that uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea. Then  again  we're doing the headquarters for NOAA    National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency    outside of Washington in Maryland. And this is how they see the world. They have    satellites zipping around at plus or minus     miles  and the site's in red. And what we really want to do    well  the architects  if there are architects out there  this is the Laugier Hut  this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long    and what we wanted to do is really build this  because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world  and we wanted them to look down at their satellite  how they see their own site  that eight acre site  and we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green. There's actually three baseball fields on it right now  and they're going to stay there. We put one piece directly north south  and it holds the dishes at the ears  right  And then right below that the processing  and the mission lift  and the mission control room  and all the other spaces are underground. And what you look at is an aircraft carrier that's performance driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes. And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion  broken up by a series of courts  and it's five acres of uninterrupted  horizontal space for their administrative offices. And then that  in turn  propelled us to look at larger scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue. The new capital competition for Berlin  four years ago. And again we just finished the ECB    actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project  where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of a park  which is parallel to the river  and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric    the social  cultural and the landscape  recreational fabric of the city. And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing  but something that's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time. And a project that was realized in Austria  the Hooper Bank  which again used this idea of connecting typology  the traditional buildings  and morphology  or the relationship of the development of land as an idea  into a complex  which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting  this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it  and other parts are much more energetic and intense. And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together  and then where part of it is in the ground  part of it is oppositional lifts. One enters the building as it lifts off the ground  and it becomes part of the idea. And then the skin    the edges of this    all promote the dynamic  the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts  geologic shifts. Right  And it makes for event space and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior  and those interiors  again  are promoting transparency for the workplace  which has been a continual interest of ours. And then  again  in a more  kind of traditional setting  this is a graduate student housing in Toronto  and it's very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city. The main idea was the gateway  where it breaks the site  and the building occupies both the public space and the private space. And it's that territory of    it's this thing. I visited the site many times  and everybody  kind of    you can see this from two kilometers away  it's an exact center of the street  and the whole notion is to engage the public  to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city. And finally  one of the most interesting projects    it's a courthouse. And what I want to talk about    this is the Supreme Court  of course    and  well  I'm dealing with Michael Hogan  the Chief Justice of Oregon. You could not proceed without making this negotiation between one's own values and the relationship of the character you're working with and how he understands the court  because I'm showing him  of course  Corbusier at Savoy  which is       which is the beginning of modern architecture. Well  then we get to this image. And this is where the project started. Because I'm going  I'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here. And really what we're talking about is constructing reality. And I'm a character that's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone. Nature in the   th century sense  alright  Nature is only a cultural edifice today  right  We construct it and we construct those ideas. And then of course  this one  our governor at the moment. And we spent some time with Conan  believe it or not  and then that led us to  kind of  the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic  architectural. And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work  and the dynamics of that  and what other sources of the work is. And it led us to the project  the courthouse  which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse. You'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court. Here's a piano nobile  which is a device used in the Renaissance. The courts were made of that. The skin is this series of layers that reflect even rusticated stonework  but which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution  which were part of the little process  all set on a plinth that defined it from the community. Thank you so much.\n",
      "I'm going to go right into the slides. And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that I do just very straight stuff. And my ideas are    in my head  anyway    they're very logical and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients. I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems  or I really do solve their problems  because usually they seem to like it. Let me go right into the slides. Can you turn off the light  Down. I like to be in the dark. I don't want you to see what I'm doing up here. Anyway  I did this house in Santa Monica  and it got a lot of notoriety. In fact  it appeared in a porno comic book  which is the slide on the right. This is in Venice. I just show it because I want you to know I'm concerned about context. On the left hand side  I had the context of those little houses  and I tried to build a building that fit into that context. When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird  and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they're photographed or seen in that space. And then  once I deal with the context  I then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene  as I hope you'll find that slide on the right. And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A. I was concerned about making a place for the study of law. And we continue to work with this client. The building on the right at the top is now under construction. The garage on the right    the gray structure    will be torn down  finally  and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we've created  this campus. And it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place. They wanted a sense of place. And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown  in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into. And it was my theory  or my point of view  that one didn't upstage the neighborhood    one made accommodations. I tried to be inclusive  to include the buildings in the neighborhood  whether they were buildings I liked or not. In the '  s I started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's. We even made flooring  walls and everything  out of cardboard. And the success of it threw me for a loop. I couldn't deal with the success of furniture    I wasn't secure enough as an architect    and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like. So  nobody would like this. And it was in this  preliminary to these pieces of furniture  that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice. And after we failed  I just kept failing. The piece on the left    and that ultimately led to the piece on the right    happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket. And I put a piece of tape around it  as you see there  and realized you could sit on it  and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on. So  it was an accidental discovery. I got into fish. I mean  the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism    at po mo    and said that fish were     million years earlier than man  and if you're going to go back  we might as well go back to the beginning. And so I started making these funny things. And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger    as the one glass at the Walker. And then  I sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what I was learning about the form of the fish and the movement. And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it    accidental  again    it was an intuitive kind of thing  and I just kept going with it  and made this proposal for a building  which was only a proposal. I did this building in Japan. I was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed. And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff. And after I got    I was really drunk    I was asked to do some sketches on napkins. And I made some sketches on napkins    little boxes and Morandi like things that I used to do. And the client said   Why no fish   And so I made a drawing with a fish  and I left Japan. Three weeks later  I received a complete set of drawings saying we'd won the competition. Now  it's hard to do. It's hard to translate a fish form  because they're so beautiful    perfect    into a building or object like this. And Oldenburg  who I work with a little once in a while  told me I couldn't do it  and so that made it even more exciting. But he was right    I couldn't do the tail. I started to get the head OK  but the tail I couldn't do. It was pretty hard. The thing on the right is a snake form  a ziggurat. And I put them together  and you walk between them. It was a dialog with the context again. Now  if you saw a picture of this as it was published in Architectural Record    they didn't show the context  so you would think   God  what a pushy guy this is.  But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant. Couldn't find it. So ... As for craft and technology and all those things that you've all been talking about  I was thrown for a complete loop. This was built in six months. The way we sent drawings to Japan  we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models  and we used to make foam models  which that thing scanned. We made the drawings of the fish and the scales. And when I got there  everything was perfect    except the tail. So  I decided to cut off the head and the tail. And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker. And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made  I think. And then Jay Chiat  a friend and client  asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A. For reasons we don't want to talk about  it got delayed. Toxic waste  I guess  is the key clue to that one. And so we built a temporary building    I'm getting good at temporary    and we put a conference room in that's a fish. And  finally  Jay dragged me to my hometown  Toronto  Canada. And there is a story    it's a real story    about my grandmother buying a carp on Thursday  bringing it home  putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid. I played with it in the evening. When I went to sleep  the next day it wasn't there. And the next night  we had gefilte fish. And so I set up this interior for Jay's offices and I made a pedestal for a sculpture. And he didn't buy a sculpture  so I made one. I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's  and I put the fish in. It was a joke. I play with funny people like  Claes  Oldenburg. We've been friends for a long time. And we've started to work on things. A few years ago  we did a performance piece in Venice  Italy  called  Il Corso del Coltello     the Swiss Army knife. And most of the imagery is    Claes'  but those two little boys are my sons  and they were Claes' assistants in the play. He was the Swiss Army knife. He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter  and I was Frankie P. Toronto. P for Palladio. Dressed up like the AT T building by Claes    with a fish hat. The highlight of the performance was at the end. This beautiful object  the Swiss Army knife  which I get credit for participating in. And I can tell you    it's totally an Oldenburg. I had nothing to do with it. The only thing I did was  I made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal  because I love sailing. We made it into a sailing craft. I've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing. I do it because it's a curious thing in the culture  when things are made in such great quantities  absorbed in such great quantities  and there's so much denial about them. People hate it. And I'm fascinated with that  which  like the paper furniture    it's one of those materials. And I'm always drawn to that. And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link  which nobody will forgive me for. But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School. And that chain link is really expensive. It's in perspective and everything. And then we did a camp together for children with cancer. And you can see  we started making a building together. Of course  the milk can is his. But we were trying to collide our ideas  to put objects next to each other. Like a Morandi    like the little bottles    composing them like a still life. And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together. Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building on this funny lot in Venice  and I started with this three piece thing  and you entered in the middle. And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle. And he pushed that. And one day I had a    oh  well  the other way. I had the binoculars from Claes  and I put them there  and I could never get rid of them after that. Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of the real proposal. It made my building look sick. And it was this interaction between that kind of  up the ante stuff that became pretty interesting. It led to the building on the left. And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars  you know  leaving out the    what the hell. I use a lot of metal in my work  and I have a hard time connecting with the craft. The whole thing about my house  the whole use of rough carpentry and everything  was the frustration with the crafts available. I said   If I can't get the craft that I want  I'll use the craft I can get.  There were plenty of models for that  in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns  and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials. I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture. And it was all of one material  and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls. The metalworkers  for the most part  do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff. I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington  and I did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings  etc. etc. And it's working very well to have these people  these craftsmen  interested in it. I just tell the stories. It's a way of connecting  at least  with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture. The metal continued into a building    Herman Miller  in Sacramento. And it's just a complex of factory buildings. And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place    a people place. I mean  it's kind of a trite thing to say  but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be  where the people would come and where the people working would interact. So it's out in the middle of nowhere  and you approach it. It's copper and galvanize. I used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge  so it would buckle. I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic. Everybody's trying to get the panels perfect  and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy. And they end up looking like stone. This is the central area. There's a ramp. And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman. Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job. And when I was awarded the contract I  at the very beginning  asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me. Because these were ideas that we were talking about  building things next to each other  making    it's all about  a  metaphor for a city  maybe. And so Stanley did the little dome thing. And we did it over the phone and by fax. He would send me a fax and show me something. He'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower. I told him   No  no  that's too ongepotchket. I don't want the tower.  So he came back with a simpler building  but he put some funny details on it  and he moved it closer to my building. And so I decided to put him in a depression. I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in. And so then he put two bridges    this all happened on the fax  going back and forth over a couple of weeks' period. And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it. And so then I put this big billboard behind it. And I call it   David and Goliath.  And that's my cafeteria. In Boston  we had that old building on the left. It was a very prominent building off the freeway  and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of    I thought    the language of the neighborhood  which had these cornices  projecting cornices. Mine got a little exuberant  but I used lead copper  which is a beautiful material  and it turns green in     years. Instead of  like  copper in    or   . We redid the side of the building and re proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space. And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved  because they have very strict kind of design guideline  and they wouldn't normally think I would fit them. The detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building. In Barcelona  on Las Ramblas for some film festival  I did the Hollywood sign going and coming  made a building out of it  and they built it. I flew in one night and took this picture. But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me. And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica    a little shopping center. And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa  in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back. It's the support labs  which  by some coincidence  required no windows. And the shape fit perfectly. I just joined the points. In the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment. That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase    a pipe canyon    and so it was an opportunity that I seized  because I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form. It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it. This is a small house somewhere. They've been building it so long I don't remember where it is. It's in the West Valley. And we started with the stream and built the house along the stream    dammed it up to make a lake. These are the models. The reality  with the lake    the workmanship is pretty bad. And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house. When you have to do something really cheaply  it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff. That big metal thing is a passage  and in it is    you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom  which is on the right. It's kind of like a whole built town. I was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale. I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that. This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota. The owners had a dilemma    they asked Philip to do it. He was too busy. He didn't recommend me  by the way. We ended up having to make it a sculpture  because the dilemma was  how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language  Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub divided  Etc. etc. You've got the idea. And so we finally ended up making it. These people are art collectors. And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side. And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it. It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin Ply    it's that formed lumber from Finland. We used it at Loyola on the chapel  and it didn't work. I keep trying to make it work. In this case we learned how to detail it. In Cleveland  there's Burnham Mall  on the left. It's never been finished. Going out to the lake  you can see all those new buildings we built. And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site. There's a railroad track. This is the city hall over here somewhere  and the courthouse. And the centerline of the mall goes out. Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built  and so we followed. Sohio is on the axis here  and we followed the axis  and they're two kind of goalposts. And this is our building  which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company. We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top  folded. The health club is fastened to the garage with a C clamp  for Cleveland. You drive down. So it's about a    story C clamp. And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum  and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry. This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries. And this would be a hotel. So  the centerline of this thing    we'd preserve it  and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox  etc.  that are underway. It's hard to do high rise. I feel much more comfortable down here. This is a piece of property in Brentwood. And a long time ago  about '   or something  after my house    I designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard    and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left. And she came back  I guess wealthier or something    something happened    and asked me to design a house for her on this site. And following that basic idea of the village  we changed it as we got into it. I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end    here you see on the photographs of the site    slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall  creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom  which I designed like a kind of a barge  looking like a boat. And that's it  built. The dome was a request from the client. She wanted a dome somewhere in the house. She didn't care where. When you sleep in this bedroom  I hope    I mean  I haven't slept in it yet. I've offered to marry her so I could sleep there  but she said I didn't have to do that. But when you're in that room  you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake. And it's very private. The landscape is being built around to create a private garden. And then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room  and one on the other side. These aren't focused very well. I don't know how to do it from here. Focus the one on the right. It's up there. Left    it's my right. Anyway  you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees. That's the living room. Servants' quarters. A guest bedroom  which has this dome with marble on it. And then you enter into the living room and then so on. This is the bedroom. You come down from this level along the stairway  and you enter the bedroom here  going into the lake. And the bed is back in this space  with windows looking out onto the lake. These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot. The material is lead copper  like in the building in Boston. And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land    it's     by        into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it. And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis with the dining room table. It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free. But the idea is  the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside. Eventually this will be screened    these trees will come up    and it will be very private. And you feel like you're in your own kind of village. This is for Michael Eisner    Disney. We're doing some work for him. And this is in Anaheim  California  and it's a freeway building. You go under this bridge at about    miles an hour  and there's another bridge here. And you're through this room in a split second  and the building will sort of reflect that. On the backside  it's much more humane    entrance  dining hall  etc. And then this thing here    I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it. Kind of a fun thing to do. I'm doing a building in Switzerland  Basel  which is an office building for a furniture company. And we struggled with the image. These are the early studies  but they have to sell furniture to normal people  so if I did the building and it was too fancy  then people might say   Well  the furniture looks OK in his thing  but no  it ain't going to look good in my normal building.  So we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here  and we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate. And you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces. This is in Paris  along the Seine. Palais des Sports  the Gare de Lyon over here. The Minister of Finance    the guy that moved from the Louvre    goes in here. There's a new library across the river. And back in here  in this already treed park  we're doing a very dense building called the American Center  which has a theater  apartments  dance school  an art museum  restaurants and all kinds of    it's a very dense program    bookstores  etc. In a very tight  small    this is the ground level. And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off. They call it the plan coupe. And I struggled with that thing    how to get around the corner. These are the models for it. I showed you the other model  the one    this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing    so I understood the problem. I was trying to get around this plan coupe    how do you do it  Apartments  etc. And these are the kind of study models we did. And the one on the left is pretty awful. You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built. But out of it came finally this resolution  where the elevator piece worked frontally to this  parallel to this street  and also parallel to here. And then this kind of twist  with this balcony and the skirt  kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer. The restaurants here    the apartments and the theater  etc. So it would all be built in stone  in French limestone  except for this metal piece. And it faces into a park. And the idea was to make this express the energy of this. On the side facing the street it's much more normal  except I slipped a few mansards down  so that coming on the point  these housing units made a gesture to the corner. And this will be some kind of high tech billboard. If any of you guys have any ideas for it  please contact me. I don't know what to do. Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment  and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons. And it's got a fish. And I keep thinking   This is going to be the last fish.  It's like a drug addict. I say   I'm not going to do it anymore    I don't want to do it anymore    I'm not going to do it.  And then I do it. There it is. But it's the living room. And this piece here is    I don't know what it is. I just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out. This is Euro Disney  and I've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier. We've had a lot of fun working together. I think I'm from Mars for them  and they are for me  but somehow we all manage to work together  and I think  productively. So far. This is a shopping thing. You come into the Magic Kingdom and the hotel that Tony Baxter's group is doing out here. And then this is a kind of a shopping mall  with a rodeo and restaurants. And another restaurant. What I did    because of the Paris skies being quite dull  I made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station  to the route of the train. It looks like it's kind of been there  and then crashed all these simpler forms into it. The light grid will have a light  be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling. In Switzerland    Germany  actually    on the Rhine across from Basel  we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum. And I tried to    there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here  there's an Oldenburg sculpture over here    I tried to make a relationship urbanistically. And I don't gave good slides to show    it's just been completed    but this piece here is this building  and these pieces here and here. And as you pass by it's always part    you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood. It's plaster and just zinc. And you wonder  if this is a museum  what it's going to be like inside  If it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything  and just wait. I'm so cunning and clever    I made it quiet and wonderful. But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit. It's actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff. And from the building in the back  you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills. I know I'm over time. See  that skylight goes down and becomes that one. So it's pretty quiet inside. This is the Disney Hall    the concert hall. It's a complicated project. It has a chamber hall. It's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built with a lot of love and tears and caring. And it's not a great building  but I approached it optimistically  that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us. And the plan of this    it's a concert hall. This is the foyer  which is kind of a garden structure. There's commercial at the ground floor. These are offices  which  really  in the competition  we didn't have to design. But finally  there's a hotel there. These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler  composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed    to MOCA  etc. The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria  which led to this compartmentalized scheme  which we found out after the competition would not work at all. But everybody liked these forms and liked the space  and so that's one of the problems of a competition. You have to then try and get that back in some way. And we studied many models. This was our original model. These were the three buildings that were the ideal    the Concertgebouw  Boston and Berlin. Everybody liked the surround. Actually  this is the smallest hall in size  and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies. Our client doesn't want balconies  so    and when we met our new acoustician  he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape. And we tried many shapes  trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical  acceptable format. We finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the Concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls  which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they weren't  but now we have them. And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room. That's the idea. And the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural. And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit  and create intimacy. Now  this is not a final design    these are just on the way to being    and so I wouldn't take it literally  except the feeling of the space. We studied the acoustics with laser stuff  and they bounce them off this and see where it all works. But you get the sense of the hall in section. Most halls come straight down into a proscenium. In this case we're opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners. And so it will be quite a different shape. The original building  because it was frog like  fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well. When you get into a box  it's harder to do it    and here we are  struggling with how to put the hotel in. And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi. I just stuck it on there. But this is how I do work. I do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away. And of course it's not going to look like that  but it is the crazy way I tend to work. And then finally  in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower  the highest building in L.A. Larry Halprin is doing the stairs. And I was asked to do a fish  and so I did a snake. It's a public space  and I made it kind of a garden structure  and you can go in it. It's a kiva  and Larry's putting some water in there  and it works much better than a fish. In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish  and we're working on that  at the foot of a Ritz Carlton Tower being done by Skidmore  Owings and Merrill. And the Ritz Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel  non fire proof  much like those old gas tanks. And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it  perverted it  into the form of the fish  and created a kind of a   th century contraption that looks like  that will sit    this is the beach and the harbor out in front  and this is really a shopping center with department stores. And we split these bridges. Originally  this was all solid with a hole in it. We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel. We showed this to the hotel people the other day  and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the Ritz Carlton anymore  because of this fish. And finally  I just threw these in    Lou Danziger. I didn't expect Lou Danziger to be here  but this is a building I did for him in       I think. A little studio    and it's sadly for sale. Time goes on. And this is my son working with me on a small fast food thing. He designed the robot as the cashier  and the head moves  and I did the rest of it. And the food wasn't as good as the stuff  and so it failed. It should have been the other way around    the food should have been good first. It didn't work. Thank you very much.\n",

      "You know  it's a big privilege for me to be working in one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world  the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. These islands   Mauritius  Rodrigues  and R union   along with the island of Madagascar  they are blessed with unique plants found nowhere else in the world. And today I will tell you  about five of them and their particular features and why these plants are so unique. Take a look at this plant. I call it benjoin in the local vernacular  and the botanical name  is Terminalia bentzoe  subspecies bentzoe. This subspecies is endemic to Mauritius  and its particular feature is its heterophylly. What do I mean by heterophylly  It's that the same plant has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes. Now  these plants have evolved very far away from the mainland  and within specific ecosystems. Often  these particular features have evolved as a response to the threat presented by the local fauna  in this case  grazing tortoises. Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight  and as such  they tend to avoid the plants they don't recognize. So this evolutionary  foil safeguards the plant against these rather cute animals  and protects it and of course  ensures its survival. Now the question you're  probably asking yourself is  why is she telling us all these stories  The reason for that is that we tend to overlook the diversity and the variety of the natural world. These particular habitats are unique and they are host to a whole lot of plants. We don't realize how valuable and how precious these resources are  and yet  through our insouciance  we keep on destroying them. We're all familiar with the macro impact of urbanization  climate change  resource exploitation  but when that one last plant   or animal for that matter   when that very last specimen has disappeared from the face of this Earth  we would have lost an entire subset of the Earth's biology  and with it  important plants  with medicinal potential or which could have ingredients that would speak to the cosmetic  nutrition  pharma  and even the ethno veterinary sectors  be gone forever. And here we have a very prime example of the iconic dodo  which comes from Mauritius  and  of course  we know is  now a symbol of extinction. We know plants have a  fundamental role to play. Well  first of all  they feed us and they also give us  the oxygen we breathe  but plants are also the source of important  biologically active ingredients that we should be studying very carefully  because human societies over the millennia  they have developed important knowledge  cultural traditions  and important plant based medicinal resources. Here's a data point   .  percent of the entire land surface is home to    percent of the species of higher plants     percent of the species of vertebrates  and this  .  percent represents the    biodiversity hotspots in the world  and this  .  percent of the entire land surface already provides for    percent of the ecosystem services that vulnerable people depend on. And as you can see  the island of Mauritius where I work and where I live  belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot  and I study the unique plants on the island for their  biomedical applications. Now  let's go back again to that first plant I showed you  the one  of course  with  different shaped leaves and different sizes  Terminalia bentzoe  subspecies bentzoe  a plant only found in Mauritius. Now  the local people  they used a decoction of the leaves against infectious diseases. Now our work  that is  the scientific validation of  this traditional information  has shown that precisely that leaf extract shows activity  potent activity  against a wide range of bacteria that could be pathogenic to humans. Now  could this plant be the answer to antibiotic resistance  You know  antibiotic resistance is proving to be a big challenge globally. While we may not be sure  one thing is certain  we will not want this plant to disappear. But the harsh reality is that this particular plant is in fact considered to be vulnerable in its natural habitat. This brings me to another example. This bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate in the local vernacular. The botanical name is Psiadia arguta. It's a plant which is rare  which is endemic to Mauritius. It used to grow on the mainland  but through the sheer  pressures of urbanization has been pushed out of the mainland  and we've managed to bring it back from the brink of extinction by developing in vitro plants which are now growing in the wild. Now  one thing I must  point out straightaway is that not all plants can be developed in vitro. While we humans  we are  happy in our comfort zone  these plants also need their ecosystem to be preserved  and they don't react   endemic plants don't react to very harsh  changes in their ecosystem  and yet we know what are the challenges that climate change  for example  is posing to these plants. Now  the local people again use the leaves in traditional medicine against respiratory problems. Now  our preliminary labwork on the leaf extract has shown that precisely these  leaves contain ingredients that are very close   in terms of structures  chemical structures  to those medicines which are sold in the chemist's shop against asthma. So who knows what humanity will benefit from should this plant decide  to reveal all its secrets. Now  I come from the developing world where we are forever being  challenged with this issue of population explosion. Africa is the continent  which is getting younger  and whenever one talks  about population explosion  one talks about the issue of food security as being the other side of the same coin. Now this plant here  the baobab  could be part of the answer. It's an underutilized  neglected food plant. It defines the landscape of West Africa  where it is known as the tree of life  and later on I will tell you why the Africans consider it to be the tree of life. Now interestingly  there are many legends which are associated with this plant. Because of its sheer size  it was meant to be lording over lesser plants  so God didn't like this arrogance  uprooted it  and planted it upside down  hence its particular shape. And if you look at this tree again within the African context  in West Africa  it's known  as the palaver tree  because it performs great social functions. Now if you have a problem in the community  meeting under the palaver tree with the chiefs or the tribesmen would be synonymous to trying to find a solution to that particular problem  and also to reinforce trust and respect among members of the community. From the scientific point of view  there are eight species of baobab in the world. There's one from Africa  one from Australia  and six are endemic to the island of Madagascar. The one I have showed you is the one from Africa  Adansonia digitata. Now  the flower  this  beautiful white flower  it opens at night  is pollinated by bats  and it gives rise to the fruit which is curiously known as the monkey apple. The monkeys are not stupid animals. They know what's good for them. Now  if you open the fruit of the baobab  you'll see a white  floury pulp  which is very rich in nutrients and has got protein  more protein than in human milk. Yes  you heard right  more protein than in human milk. And this is one of the reasons why the nutrition companies of this world  they are looking for this fruit to provide what we know as reinforced food. The seeds give an oil  a very stable oil which is sought after  by the cosmetic industry to give to produce body lotions  for example. And if you look at the trunk  the trunk  of course  safeguards water  which is often harvested by a thirsty traveler  and the leaves are used in traditional medicine against infectious disease. Now  you can see now why the Africans consider it to be the tree of life. It's a complete plant  and in fact  the sheer size of these trees is hiding a massive potential  not only for the pharma  nutrition  and the cosmetic industry. What I have showed you here is only the species from Africa  Adansonia digitata. We have six species yet in Madagascar  and we don't know what  is the potential of this plant  but one thing we know is that the flora is considered to be  threatened with extinction. Let me take you to Africa again  and introduce you to one of my very favorite  the resurrection plant. Now here you'll find that even Jesus has competition. Now  this plant here has developed remarkable tolerance to drought  which enables it to withstand up to    percent dehydration  over the period of a year without damage  and yet it can regenerate  itself almost completely overnight  over    hours  and flower. Now  us human beings  we're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth. We don't want to get old  and rightly so. Why should we  especially if you can afford it  And this gives you an indication of what the plant looks like before. Now  if you are an inexperienced gardener  the first thing you'll do  when you visit the garden is to uproot this plant because it's dead. But if you water it  this is what you get. Absolutely amazing. Now  if you look at our aging process  the aging process is in fact the loss of water from the upper epidermis  resulting in wrinkling as we know it  especially women  we are so conscious of this. And this plant  in fact  is giving  the cosmetic chemists very important ingredients that are actually finding ways to slow down the aging process and at the same time reinforce the cells against the onslaught of environmental toxins. Now  these four examples I have just given you are just a very tiny reminder as to how our health and our survival are closely linked to the health and the resilience of our ecosystem  and why we should be very careful about preserving biodiversity. Every time a forest is cut down  every time a marsh is filled in  it is a potential lab that goes with it  and which we will never  ever recover. And I know what I'm talking about  coming from Mauritius and missing the dodo. Let me finish with just one last example. Conservation issues are normally guided towards rare  endemic plants  but what we call exotic plants  that is  the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world  they also need to be considered. You know why  Because the environment plays a very important role in modifying the composition of that plant. So let's take a look at this plant here  Centella asiatica. It's a weed. We call it a weed. Now  Centella asiatica  grows across the world in many different habitats    in Africa  in Asia   and this plant has been instrumental in providing a solution  to that dreadful disease called leprosy in Madagascar in the     s. Now  while Centella  grows across the world   in Africa  in Asia    the best quality Centella comes from Madagascar  because that Centella contains the three vital ingredients which are sought after by the pharma and the cosmetic companies. And the cosmetic companies  are already using it to make regenerating cream. Now  there is an ancient saying that for every disease known to mankind  there is a plant to cure it. Now  you may not  believe in ancient sayings. You may think they're obsolete now that our science and  technology are so powerful. So you may look on Centella as being an insignificant  humble weed  which  if destroyed  won't be missed. But you know  there is no such thing as a weed. It's a plant. It's a living biological lab that may well have answers to the question that we may have  but we have to ensure that it has the right to live. Thank you.\n",
      "I was walking in the market one day with my wife  and somebody stuck a cage in my face. And in between those slits were the saddest eyes I've ever seen. There was a very sick orangutan baby  my first encounter. That evening I came back to the market in the dark and I heard  uhh  uhh   and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap. Of course  the cage was salvaged. I took up the little baby  massaged her  forced her to drink until she finally started breathing normally. This is Uce. She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain  and this is Matahari  her second son  which  by the way  is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued  Dodoy. That changed my life quite dramatically  and as of today  I have almost       babies in my two centers. No. No. No. Wrong. It's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild. It's not good. This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing. Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together  just now like victims for every baby  six have disappeared from the forest. The deforestation  especially for oil palm  to provide biofuel for Western countries is what's causing these problems. And those are the peat swamp forests on    meters of peat  the largest accumulation of organic material in the world. When you open this for growing oil palms you're creating CO  volcanoes that are emitting so much CO  that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world  after China and the United States. And we don't have any industry at all    it's only because of this deforestation. And these are horrible images. I'm not going to talk too long about it  but there are so many of the family of Uce  which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest  that still have to go through that process. And I don't know anymore where to put them. So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests  to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing  in that way  the loss of habitat and all those victims. So I created the place Samboja Lestari  and the idea was  if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left  no one will have an excuse to say   Yeah  but ...  No. Everyone should be able to follow this. So we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started. As you can see there's only yellow terrain. There's nothing left    just a bit of grass there. In      we had about    percent of the people jobless there. There was a huge amount of crime. People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water. There was no agricultural productivity left. This was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife. This was like a biological desert. When I stood there in the grass  it's hot    not even the sound of insects    just this waving grass. Still  four years later we have created jobs for about       people. The climate has changed. I will show you  no more flooding  no more fires. It's no longer the poorest district  and there is a huge development of biodiversity. We've got over       species. We have     bird species as of today. We have    species of reptiles. So what happened here  We created a huge economic failure in this forest. So basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm. But we saw the same thing. We had slash and burn agriculture  people cannot afford the fertilizer  so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there  the fires become more frequent  and after a while you're stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left. There are no trees left. Still  in this place  in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill  four years later  there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ... And there are all these animals  and all these people happy  and there's this economic value. So how's this possible  It was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps  we bought the land  we dealt with the fire  and then only  we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry. Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary. But we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that. The people would become the defenders of that forest. So we do the  people  profit  planet  principles  but we do it in addition to a sure legal status    because if the forest belongs to the state  people say   It belongs to me  it belongs to everyone.  And then we apply all these other principles like transparency  professional management  measurable results  scalability   unclear   etc. What we did was we formulated recipes    how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation. You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control  whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice. And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out. Now in this recipe you also have the cost. You also know how much labor is needed. If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil  on a clay soil  on a steep slope  on flat soil  you put those different recipes  if you combine them  out of that comes a business plan  comes a work plan  and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have  and you can do it. This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of. It exudes  unclear  like compounds from the roots. The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro climate  to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses. And after eight years they might actually yield some timber    that is  if you can preserve it in the right way  which we can do with bamboo peels. It's an old temple building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire susceptible. So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again. So we plant it later  along the waterways to filter the water  provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available. So the idea is  how to integrate these flows in space  over time and with the limited means you have. So we plant the trees  we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between  to reduce the competition for the trees  the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops  for the people  but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land  the system yields early income  the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money. So beautiful. What a theory. But is it really that easy  Not really  because if you looked at what happened in       the fire started. This is an area of about    million hectares. January. February. March. April. May. We lost  .  million hectares in just a matter of a few months. This is because we have        of those underground fires that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States. And once the soil gets dried  you're in a dry season    you get cracks  oxygen goes in  flames come out and the problem starts all over again. So how to break that cycle  Fire is the biggest problem. This is what it looked like for three months. For three months  the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark. We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year  they lost    IQ points. It was a disaster for orangutans and people. So these fires are really the first things to work on. That was why I put it as a single point up there. And you need the local people for that because these grasslands  once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall    going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there. So you have to do it with the local people. That is the short term solution but you also need a long term solution. So what we did is  we created a ring of sugar palms around the area. These sugar palms turn out to be fire resistant    also flood resistant  by the way    and they provide a lot of income for local people. This is what it looks like  the people have to tap them twice a day    just a millimeter slice    and the only thing you harvest is sugar water  carbon dioxide  rain fall and a little bit of sunshine. In principle  you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells. And you can create so much energy from this    they produce three times more energy per hectare per year  because you can tap them on a daily basis. You don't need to harvest  unclear  or any other of the crops. So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics  which is still unexploited  and doing it in combination with technology. But also your legal side needs to be in very good order. So we bought that land  and here is where we started our project    in the middle of nowhere. And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil  and we were actually monitoring  measuring every single tree in these       hectares        acres. And this forest is quite different. What I really did was I just followed nature  and nature doesn't know monocultures  but a natural forest is multilayered. That means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light  it can store more carbon in the system  it can provide more functions. But  it's more complicated. It's not that simple  and you have to work with the people. So  just like nature  we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that  we grow the slower growing  primary grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light. Then  what is just as important  get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves  bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within    hours. And they become like nutrient pumps. You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen  and without those microorganisms  you won't have any performance at all. And then we started planting    only       trees a day. We could have planted many  many more  but we didn't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable. We didn't want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation. And we do a lot of work here. We use indicator plants to look at what soil types  or what vegetables will grow  or what trees will grow here. And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space. This is what it looks like in reality  you have this irregular ring around it  with strips of     meters wide  with sugar palms that can provide income for     families. It's only a small part of the area. The nursery  in here  is quite different. If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe  for instance  from the Urals up to England  you know how many     . In this nursery  we're going to grow    times more than the number of species. Can you imagine  You do need to know what you are working with  but it's that diversity which makes it work. That you can go from this zero situation  by planting the vegetables and the trees  or directly  the trees in the lines in that grass there  putting up the buffer zone  producing your compost  and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used. In the beginning  maybe pineapples and beans and corn  in the second phase  there will be bananas and papayas  later on  there will be chocolate and chilies. And then slowly  the trees start taking over  bringing in produce from the fruits  from the timber  from the fuel wood. And finally  the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income. On the top left  underneath those green stripes  you see some white dots    those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space. And in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before. So this is after one year. And this is after two years. And that's green. If you look from the tower    this is when we start attacking the grass. We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas  the papayas  all the crops for the local people  but the trees are growing up fast in between as well. And three years later      species of birds are living here. So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius. Air humidity is up    percent. Cloud cover    I'm going to show it to you    is up. Rainfall is up. And all these species and income. This ecolodge that I built here  three years before  was an empty  yellow field. This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency    it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture. Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon  how the forest is developing  and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation. We can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology. We actually have it already with Google Earth. If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks  and use Google Earth in combination with that  you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced  which company is stealing the timber  and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here. So this is the Samboja Lestari area. You measure how the trees grow back  but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back. And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced  how many medicines can be kept here. And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain. This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water  it's    percent surrounded by seawater  and we have now a lot of intrusion there. Now we looked at the clouds above this forest  we looked at the reforestation area  the semi open area and the open area. And look at these images. I'll just run them very quickly through. In the tropics  raindrops are not formed from ice crystals  which is the case in the temperate zones  you need the trees with  unclear   chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops. So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate  and you have the trees to initiate the rain. And look  there's now   .  percent more clouds    already  after three years. If you look at rainfall  it was already up    percent at that time. Let's look at the next year  and you can see that that trend is continuing. Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall  that cap is now widening and getting higher. And if we look at the rainfall pattern above Samboja Lestari  it used to be the driest place  but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there. So you can actually change the climate. When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears  but afterwards  as soon as the wind stabilizes  you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area. So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do  because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies. And it's nice to have the science  but it still depends mostly upon the people  on your education. We have our farmer schools. But the real success of course  is our band    because if a baby is born  we will play  so everyone's our family and you don't make trouble with your family. This is how it looks. We have this road going around the area  which brings the people electricity and water from our own area. We have the zone with the sugar palms  and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans    that we provide with a place to live in the middle    and the people apart. And inside  we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive  because for the last    years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up because the climatic triggers have disappeared. All the seeds get eaten. So now we do the monitoring on the inside    from towers  satellites  ultralights. Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back. And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees    you have the shade trees planted in year one  then you underplanted with the sugar palms  and you plant this thorny fence. And after a few years  you can remove some of those shade trees. The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel  and they can build a house  they have some fuel wood to cook with. And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like. They have enough income for three families. But whatever you do in that program  it has to be fully supported by the people  meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local  cultural values. There is no simple one recipe for one place. You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt    that it's transparent. Like here  in Samboja Lestari  we divide that ring in groups of    families. If one member trespasses the agreement  and does cut down trees  the other    members have to decide what's going to happen to him. If the group doesn't take action  the other    groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them. In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative    they have a democratic culture there  so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system. In summary  if you look at it  in year one the people can sell their land to get income  but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation  the working with the orangutans  and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft. They also get free land in between the trees  where they can grow their crops. They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project. They get building material for houses  a contract for selling the sugar  so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally. They get all these other benefits  environmentally  money  they get education    it's a great deal. And everything is based upon that one thing    make sure that forest remains there. So if we want to help the orangutans    what I actually set out to do    we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit. Now I think the real key to doing it  to give a simple answer  is integration. I hope    if you want to know more  you can read more.\n",
      "All human life  all life  depends on plants. Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds. Just think for a moment. It doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village  or you live in a big city  everything comes back to plants in the end  whether it's for the food  the medicine  the fuel  the construction  the clothing  all the obvious things  or whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things that matter to us so much  or whether it's soil formation  or the effect on the atmosphere  or primary production. Damn it  even the books here are made out of plants. All these things  they come back to plants. And without them we wouldn't be here. Now plants are under threat. They're under threat because of changing climate. And they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us. And people like us want to do things that destroy plants  and their habitats. And whether that's because of food production  or because of the introduction of alien plants into places that they really oughtn't be  or because of habitats being used for other purposes    all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt  or die  or move. And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way. So if all human life depends on plants  doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them  I think it does. And I want to tell you about a project to save plants. And the way that you save plants is by storing seeds. Because seeds  in all their diverse glory  are plants' futures. All the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds. So here is the building  it looks rather unassuming  really. But it goes down below ground many stories. And it's the largest seed bank in the world. It exists not only in southern England  but distributed around the world. I'll come to that. This is a nuclear proof facility. God forbid that it should have to withstand that. So if you're going to build a seed bank  you have to decide what you're going to store in it. Right  And we decided that what we want to store first of all  are the species that are most under threat. And those are the dry land species. So first of all we did deals with    different countries. It means negotiating with heads of state  and with secretaries of state in    countries to sign treaties. We have     partner institutions all over the world  in all those countries colored orange. People come from all over the world to learn  and then they go away and plan exactly how they're going to collect these seeds. They have thousands of people all over the world tagging places where those plants are said to exist. They search for them. They find them in flower. And they go back when their seeds have arrived. And they collect the seeds. All over the world. The seeds    some of if is very untechnical. You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off. You label them. You do some high tech things here and there  some low tech things here and there. And the main thing is that you have to dry them very carefully  at low temperature. And then you have to store them at about minus    degrees C    that's about minus four Fahrenheit  I think    with a very critically low moisture content. And these seeds will be able to germinate  we believe  with many of the species  in thousands of years  and certainly in hundreds of years. It's no good storing the seeds if you don't know they're still viable. So every    years we do germination tests on every sample of seeds that we have. And this is a distributed network. So all around the world people are doing the same thing. And that enables us to develop germination protocols. That means that we know the right combination of heat and cold and the cycles that you have to get to make the seed germinate. And that is very useful information. And then we grow these things  and we tell people  back in the countries where these seeds have come from   Look  actually we're not just storing this to get the seeds later  but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants.  And that's already happening. So where have we got to  I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed    that's three thousand millionth seed    is now stored. Ten percent of all plant species on the planet         species are safe         species  if we get the funding  by next year. Twenty five percent of all the world's plants  by     . These are not just crop plants  as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway    fantastic work there. This is at least     times bigger. We have thousands of collections that have been sent out all over the world  drought tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt  especially photosynthetic efficient plants come here to the United States  salt tolerant pasture species sent to Australia  the list goes on and on. These seeds are used for restoration. So in habitats that have already been damaged  like the tall grass prairie here in the USA  or in mined land in various countries  restoration is already happening because of these species    and because of this collection. Some of these plants  like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen  they are down to the last few remaining members. The one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck  that is down to about    last remaining trees. Fantastically useful plant  both for protein and for medicine. We have training going on in China  in the USA  and many other countries. How much does it cost        dollars per species is the average. I think that's cheap  at the price. And that gets you all the scientific data that goes with it. The future research is  How can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds  without having to plant them every    years   And we're almost there. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Sometimes I go browsing  through  a very old magazine. I found this observation test about the story of the ark. And the artist that drew this observation test did some errors  had some mistakes    there are more or less    mistakes. Some of them are very easy. There is a funnel  an aerial part  a lamp and clockwork key on the ark. Some of them are about the animals  the number. But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that's not reported here. And this problem is  where are the plants  So now we have God that is going to submerge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period  and no one is taking care of plants. Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird  of every kind of animal  of every kind of creature that moves  but no mention about plants. Why  In another part of the same story  all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark  so birds  livestock and wild animals. Plants are not living creatures    this is the point. That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible  but it's something that really accompanied humanity. Let's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a Renaissance book. Here we have the description of the order of nature. It's a nice description because it's starting from left    you have the stones    immediately after the stones  the plants that are just able to live. We have the animals that are able to live and to sense  and on the top of the pyramid  there is the man. This is not the common man. The  Homo studiosus     the studying man. This is quite comforting for people like me    I'm a professor    this to be over there on the top of creation. But it's something completely wrong. You know very well about professors. But it's also wrong about plants  because plants are not just able to live  they are able to sense. They are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals. Just to give you an example  every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least    different chemical and physical parameters. And they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence. Well  but this is something    this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us. Let's have a look at this short movie now. We have David Attenborough. Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover  he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior. Now  when he speaks about plants  everything is correct. When he speaks about animals   he  tends to remove the fact that plants exist. The blue whale  the biggest creature that exists on the planet    that is wrong  completely wrong. The blue whale  it's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet    that is  this wonderful  magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum. And this is a living organism that has a mass of at least       tons. Now  the story that plants are some low level organisms has been formalized many times ago by Aristotle  that in  De Anima     that is a very influential book for the Western civilization    wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living. They have just a kind of very low level soul. It's called the vegetative soul  because they lack movement  and so they don't need to sense. Let's see. Okay  some of the movements of the plants are very well known. This is a very fast movement. This is a Dionaea  a Venus fly trap hunting snails    sorry for the snail. This has been something that has been refused for centuries  despite the evidence. No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal  because it was against the order of nature. But plants are also able to show a lot of movement. Some of them are very well known  like the flowering. It's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse. Some of them are much more sophisticated. Look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time. And it's really so graceful  it's like a dancing angel. They are also able to play    they are really playing. These are young sunflowers  and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing. They are training themselves  as many young animals do  to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day. They are able to respond to gravity  of course  so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity. But they are also able to sleep. This is one  Mimosa pudica. So during the night  they curl the leaves and reduce the movement  and during the day  you have the opening of the leaves    there is much more movement. This is interesting because this sleeping machinery  it's perfectly conserved. It's the same in plants  in insects and in animals. And so if you need to study this sleeping problem  it's easy to study on plants  for example  than in animals and it's much more easy even ethically. It's a kind of vegetarian experimentation. Plants are even able to communicate    they are extraordinary communicators. They communicate with other plants. They are able to distinguish kin and non kin. They communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles  for example  during the pollination. Now with the pollination  it's a very serious issue for plants  because they move the pollen from one flower to the other  yet they cannot move from one flower to the other. So they need a vector    and this vector  it's normally an animal. Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination  but not just insects  even birds  reptiles  and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen. This is a serious business. We have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance    very energizing    having in change this transportation of the pollen. But some plants are manipulating animals  like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen. Now  there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen. How is it possible to do this without a brain  We need to wait until       when this big man  Charles Darwin  publishes a wonderful  astonishing book that starts a revolution. The title is  The Power of Movement in Plants.  No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before Charles Darwin. In his book  assisted by his son  Francis    who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world  in Cambridge    they took into consideration every single movement for     pages. And in the last paragraph of the book  it's a kind of stylistic mark  because normally Charles Darwin stored  in the last paragraph of a book  the most important message. He wrote that   It's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals.  This is not a metaphor. He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was J.D. Hooker  or at that time  president of the Royal Society  so the maximum scientific authority in Britain speaking about the brain in the plants. Now  this is a root apex growing against a slope. So you can recognize this kind of movement  the same movement that worms  snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display. And it's not an easy movement because  to have this kind of movement  you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain. So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here  depicted in blue    that is called the  transition zone.  And this region  it's a very small region    it's less than one millimeter. And in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important  you have these kinds of signals here. The signals that you are seeing here are action potential  are the same signals that the neurons of my brain  of our brain  use to exchange information. Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature  but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant  like a plant of rye. We have almost    million roots. We have    and a half million root apex and a total length of     or more kilometers and a very high surface area. Now let's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others. Here were have on the left  the Internet and on the right  the root apparatus. They work in the same way. They are a network of small computing machines  working in networks. And why are they so similar  Because they evolved for the same reason  to survive predation. They work in the same way. So you can remove    percent of the root apparatus and the plants  continue  to work. You can remove    percent of the Internet and it is  continuing  to work. So  a suggestion for the people working with networks  plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks. And another possibility is a technological possibility. Let's imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants. Until now  the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot. We have the animaloid    and the normal robots inspired by animals  insectoid  so on. We have the androids that are inspired by man. But why have we not any plantoid  Well  if you want to fly  it's good that you look at birds    to be inspired by birds. But if you want to explore soils  or if you want to colonize new territory  to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this. We have another possibility we are working  on  in our lab   which  is to build hybrids. It's much more easy to build hybrids. Hybrid means it's something that's half living and half machine. It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals. They have computing power  they have electrical signals. The connection with the machine is much more easy  much more even ethically possible. And these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids  driven by algae or by the leaves at the end  by the most  most powerful parts of the plants  by the roots. Well  thank you for your attention. And before I finish  I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation. Thank you.\n",
      "Technology can change our understanding of nature. Take for example the case of lions. For centuries  it's been said that female lions do all of the hunting out in the open savanna  and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner. You've heard this too  I can tell. Well recently  I led an airborne mapping campaign in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars on male and female lions  and we mapped their hunting behavior from the air. The lower left shows a lion sizing up a herd of impala for a kill  and the right shows what I call the lion viewshed. That's how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation. And what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be. They just use a different strategy. Whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances  usually during the day  male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation  and often at night. This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right. Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation  and the white are wide open spaces. And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions. All of a sudden  you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting. I bring up this example to begin  because it emphasizes how little we know about nature. There's been a huge amount of work done so far to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests  and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate  as shown in red on the slide. I find it ironic that we're doing so much  yet these areas are fairly unknown to science. So how can we save what we don't understand  Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer with a background in physics and chemistry and biology and a lot of other boring subjects  but above all  I'm obsessed with what we don't know about our planet. So I created this  the Carnegie Airborne Observatory  or CAO. It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job  but I packed it with over       kilos of high tech sensors  computers  and a very motivated staff of Earth scientists and pilots. Two of our instruments are very unique  one is called an imaging spectrometer that can actually measure the chemical composition of plants as we fly over them. Another one is a set of lasers  very high powered lasers  that fire out of the bottom of the plane  sweeping across the ecosystem and measuring it at nearly         times per second in high resolution  D. Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco  not far from where I live. Although we flew straight over this bridge  we imaged it in  D  captured its color in just a few seconds. But the real power of the CAO is its ability to capture the actual building blocks of ecosystems. This is a small town in the Amazon  imaged with the CAO. We can slice through our data and see  for example  the  D structure of the vegetation and the buildings  or we can use the chemical information to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing as we fly over them. The hottest pinks are the fastest growing plants. And we can see biodiversity in ways that you never could have imagined. This is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon. This is how we see a rainforest  in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another. But you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales  and what that means is that they're impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them. So our imagery is  D  it's chemical  it's biological  and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy  but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest. Now I created the CAO in order to answer questions that have proven extremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point  such as from the ground  or from satellite sensors. I want to share three of those questions with you today. The first questions is  how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests  Tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees  and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we're going to avoid any further global warming. Unfortunately  global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector. That's all ships  airplanes  trains  and automobiles combined. So it's understandable that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation  but they're doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science. If you don't know where the carbon is exactly  in detail  how can you know what you're losing  Basically  we need a high tech accounting system. With our system  we're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail. The red shows  obviously  closed canopy tropical forest  and then you see the cookie cutting  or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens. It's like cutting a cake except this cake is about whale deep. And yet  we can zoom in and see the forest and the trees at the same time. And what's amazing is  even though we flew very high above this forest  later on in analysis  we can go in and actually experience the treetrops  leaf by leaf  branch by branch  just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves. We've been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the Amazon Basin and not so faraway places like the United States and Central America. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you on a high resolution  first time tour of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama. The colors are going to be going from red to blue. Red is extremely high carbon stocks  your largest cathedral forests you can imagine  and blue are very low carbon stocks. And let me tell you  Peru alone is an amazing place  totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today. We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red  and the Amazon River and floodplain cutting right through it. We can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation in blue  and the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange. We can also fly to the southern Andes to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geography ends as we go up into the mountain system. And we can go to the biggest swamp in the western Amazon. It's a watery dreamworld akin to Jim Cameron's  Avatar.  We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries  Panama  and see also a huge range of carbon variation  from high in red to low in blue. Unfortunately  most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands  but what you see that's left  in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds  is the stuff that's up in the mountains. One interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen. You're seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal. That's in the reds and yellows. The canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce. This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development. It's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change. My second question  How do we prepare for climate change in a place like the Amazon rainforest  Let me tell you  I spend a lot of time in these places  and we're seeing the climate changing already. Temperatures are increasing  and what's really happening is we're getting a lot of droughts  recurring droughts. The      mega drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe. The Amazon was so dry in      that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself dried up partially  as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide. What we found is that in very remote areas  these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests. For example  these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the      drought. This area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil  totally unexplored  almost totally unknown scientifically. So what we think  as Earth scientists  is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the Andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change. One of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak. Look at this     square kilometer gash in the forest created by gold miners. You see the forest in green in  D  and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface. Species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this  obviously. If you haven't been to the Amazon  you should go. It's an amazing experience every time  no matter where you go. You're going to probably see it this way  on a river. But what happens is a lot of times the rivers hide what's really going on back in the forest itself. We flew over this same river  imaged the system in  D. The forest is on the left. And then we can digitally remove the forest and see what's going on below the canopy. And in this case  we found gold mining activity  all of it illegal  set back away from the river's edge  as you'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right. Don't worry  we're working with the authorities to deal with this and many  many other problems in the region. So in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique  important corridors like the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor  we have to start making geographically explicit plans now. How do we do that if we don't know the geography of biodiversity in the region  if it's so unknown to science  So what we've been doing is using the laser guided spectroscopy from the CAO to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest. Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors. Reds are one type of species  blues are another  and greens are yet another. And when we take this together and scale up to the regional level  we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work. This tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat  and that's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate shifts. And this is the pivotal information that's needed by decision makers to develop protected areas in the context of their regional development plans. And third and final question is  how do we manage biodiversity on a planet of protected ecosystems  The example I started out with about lions hunting  that was a study we did behind the fence line of a protected area in South Africa. And the truth is  much of Africa's nature is going to persist into the future in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen. This puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management. They need to do and make decisions that will benefit all of the species that they're protecting. Some of their decisions have really big impacts. For example  how much and where to use fire as a management tool  Or  how to deal with a large species like elephants  which may  if their populations get too large  have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species. And let me tell you  these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape. In the foreground is an area with lots of fire and lots of elephants  wide open savanna in blue  and just a few trees. As we cross this fence line  now we're getting into an area that has had protection from fire and zero elephants  dense vegetation  a radically different ecosystem. And in a place like Kruger  the soaring elephant densities are a real problem. I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you  and there are no easy answers with this. But what's good is that the technology we've developed and we're working with in South Africa  for example  is allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna  and then through repeat flights we're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants  in the red as you see on the screen  and how much that's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna. That's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you. So really  the way we're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it as tending to a circle of life  where we have fire management  elephant management  those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem  and then those impacts affecting everything from insects up to apex predators like lions. Going forward  I plan to greatly expand the airborne observatory. I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet with technologies like this. Until then  you're going to find me flying in some remote place that you've never heard of. I just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet  but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it. Thank you.\n",

      "I grew up in Northern Ireland  right up in the very  very north end of it there  where it's absolutely freezing cold. This was me running around in the back garden mid summer. I couldn't pick a career. In Ireland the obvious choice is the military  but to be honest it actually kind of sucks. My mother wanted me to be a dentist. But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up. So I actually went to school in Belfast  which was where all the action happened. And this was a pretty common sight. The school I went to was pretty boring. They forced us to learn things like Latin. The school teachers weren't having much fun  the sports were very dirty or very painful. So I cleverly chose rowing  which I got very good at. And I was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day  and I flipped over right in front of the entire school. And that was the finishing post right there. So this was extremely embarrassing. But our school at that time got a grant from the government  and they got an incredible computer    the research machine  DZ    and they left the programming manuals lying around. And so students like myself with nothing to do  we would learn how to program it. Also around this time  at home  this was the computer that people were buying. It was called the Sinclair ZX  . This was a  K computer  and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape. Actually I'm just going to pause for one second  because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED    you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair. So I brought a picture with big hair. I just want to get that out of the way. So after the Sinclair ZX   came along the very cleverly named Sinclair ZX  . And    you see the picture at the bottom  There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son. That's what they thought they had built it for. The reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it. We were programming in BASIC  which is a pretty awful language for games  so we ended up learning Assembly language so we could really take control of the hardware. This is the guy that invented it  Sir Clive Sinclair  and he's showing his machine. You had this same thing in America  it was called the Timex Sinclair    . To play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing  Battlestar Galactica.  The graphics were just horrible. You had to have an even better imagination to play this game   Death Rider.  But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves. They started making their own video games. This is one of my favorite ones here  where they have rabbit breeding  so males choose the lucky rabbit. It was around this time we went from  K to   K  which was quite the leap. And if you're wondering how much   K is  this eBay logo here is   K. And in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program. And that's what it looked like. I spent ages flying this flight simulator  and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it. Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer. He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe. He's a multi millionaire  and I think that's why he's smiling in this photograph. So I went on for the next    years or so making a lot of different games. Some of the highlights were things like  The Terminator    Aladdin   the  Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.  Because I was from the United Kingdom  they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children  so they decided to call it hero instead. I personally preferred the Spanish version  which was  Tortugas Ninja.  That was much better. Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry and Hollywood to actually work together on something    instead of licensing from each other  to actually work. Now  Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me  so I've done that. The video game industry in      became a    billion dollar business. It grows every year. Last year was the biggest year. By       we're going to kick the butt of the music industry. By       we're going to hit    billion.    percent of gamers are female. So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware. The average age of gamers  Well  obviously it's for children  right  Well  no  actually it's    years old. And interestingly  the people who buy the most games are   . So    is our target audience. All video games are violent. Of course the newspapers love to beat on this. But    percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever  so it's just not true. Online gaming statistics. I brought some stuff on  World of Warcraft.  It's  .  million players. It makes about    million bucks a month in subscriptions. It costs    bucks just to install it on your computer  making the publisher about another     million. The game costs about    million dollars to make  so basically it pays for itself in about a month. A player in a game called  Project Entropia  actually bought his own island for        dollars. You have to remember that this is not a real island. He didn't actually buy anything  just some data. But he got great terms on it. This purchase included mining and hunting rights  ownership of all land on the island  and a castle with no furniture included. This market is now estimated at over     million dollars annually. And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves. They found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games. I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on  typed in World of Warcraft  got       items. I liked this one the best  a level    Warlock with lots of epics for         dollars. It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it. So as far as popularity of games  what do you think these people are doing here  It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music. That's what the show looks like. You would expect it to be cheesy  but it's not. It's very  very epic and a very beautiful concert. And the people that went there absolutely loved it. What do you think these people are doing  They're actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other. And this is happening in every city around the world. This is happening in your local cities too  you're probably just not aware of it. Now  Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving. I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it. But what I want you to do is to try to understand it. We're on this curve  and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better. And I'm going to show you up to maybe     . But I want you to try and think about what games could look like    years from now. So we're going to start that video. Video  Throughout human history people have played games. As man's intellect and technology have evolved so too have the games he plays. David Perry  The thing again I want you to think about is  don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is. Think about that's where we are right now  and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue to get better. This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today. You need to be really an incredible artist. And once we get enough of those guys  we're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we've never been to before  or characters that we've just never seen before. So the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio. But if you were to go to a game developers conference  what they're all talking about is emotion  purpose  meaning  understanding and feeling. You'll hear about talks like  can a video game make you cry  And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about. I came across a student who's absolutely excellent at expressing himself  and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at TED had seen it. So I'd like to play this video. So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are. Video  I  like many of you  live somewhere between reality and video games. Some part of me    a true living  breathing person    has become programmed  electronic and virtual. The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy has finally begun to crumble. I'm a video game addict and this is my story. In the year of my birth the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development. I played in the backyard  learned to read  and even ate some of my vegetables. Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos. But as was the case for most of my generation  I spent a lot of time in front of the TV. Mr. Rogers  Walt Disney  Nick Junior  and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly left their mark on me. When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo  whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me. At some point something clicked. With the combination of simple  interactive stories and the warmth of the TV set  my simple    bit Nintendo became more than just an escape. It became an alternate existence  my virtual reality. I'm a video game addict  and it's not because of a certain number of hours I have spent playing  or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level. It is because I have had life altering experiences in virtual space  and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is real and what is not. I'm addicted  because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality  I still crave more. From an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally in what unfolded before me on screen. Today  after    years of watching TV geared to make me emotional  even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes. I am just one of a new generation that is growing up. A generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world. Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap  a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres  or the news we watch on TV. And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited  what I do learn applies to my real life. Play enough video games and eventually you will really believe you can snowboard  fly a plane  drive a nine second quarter mile  or kill a man. I know I can. Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it  video games actually allow us to become part of the machine. They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive  downloaded  streaming  HD reality. We are interacting with our entertainment. I have come to expect this level of interaction. Without it  the problems faced in the real world    poverty  war  disease and genocide    lack the levity they should. Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time TV. But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics  the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound. It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional. I have fought in wars  feared for my own survival  watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any news story. The people who create these games are smart. They know what makes me scared  excited  panicked  proud or sad. Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create. A well designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience. As one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts away. I know what I want and I do it. No buttons to push  no triggers to pull  just me and the game. My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands. I know violent video games make my mother worry. What troubles me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence  but that real life violence is starting to look more and more like a video game. These are all troubles outside of myself. I  however  have a problem very close to home. Something has happened to my brain. Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts  the things we know to do before we even think. While some of these instincts may be innate  most are learned  and all of them are hardwired into our brains. These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds. Only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap in stimuli. As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life  only virtually. Consider this    my real life car has about        miles on it. In all my driving games  I've driven a total of        miles. To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game. The sensory cues are very similar. It's a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the TV than you have in real life. When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is  this is almost as beautiful as my games are. For my virtual worlds are perfect. More beautiful and rich than the real world around us. I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are  but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me. Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just simply TVs. Video games are fun  engaging  and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re programming. But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad. Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other  or helps us to understand the problems we're all facing in the real world. There is a potential to do good as well. It is critical  as these virtual worlds continue to mirror the real world we live in  that game developers realize that they have tremendous responsibilities before them. I'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization. But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way I do. What I have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics  sound  game play and emotion it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating and addictive to me. I know that I am losing my grip. Part of me is just waiting to let go. I know though  that no matter how amazing video games may become  or how flat the real world may seem to us  that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug. DP  Wow. I found that video very  very thought provoking  and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see. And what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio. But as you heard  Michael talked about all these other elements as well. Video games give an awful lot of other things too  and that's why people get so addicted. The most important one being fun. The name of this track is  The Magic To Come.  Who is that going to come from  Is it going to come from the best directors in the world as we thought it probably would  I don't think so. I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past. They're going to do it their way  using the tools that we've created. The same with students or highly creative people  writers and people like that. As far as colleges go  there's about     colleges around the world teaching video game courses. That means there's literally thousands of new ideas. Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great. There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone try and pitch you a really bad video game idea. Chris Anderson  You're off  you're off. That's it. He's out of time. DP  I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me. CA  Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though. DP  This is just a cool shot  because this is students coming to school after class. The school is closed  they're coming back at midnight because they want to pitch their video game ideas. I'm sitting at the front of the class  and they're actually pitching their ideas. So it's hard to get students to come back to class  but it is possible. This is my daughter  her name's Emma  she's    months old. And I've been asking myself  what is Emma going to experience in the video game world  And as I've shown here  we have the audience. She's never going to know a world where you can't press a button and have millions of people ready to play. You know  we have the technology. She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't stunning and really immersive. And as the student video showed  we can impact and move. She's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry. I just hope she likes video games. So  my closing thought. Games on the surface seem simple entertainment  but for those that like to look a little deeper  the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers to creative minds that like to think big. Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED  Thank you. Chris Anderson  David Perry. That was awesome.\n",
      "I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer. I've been making games online now for    years  and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games. Now  I have a plan for this  and it entails convincing more people  including all of you  to spend more time playing bigger and better games. Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games. Some of you might be thinking   That's a lot of time to spend playing games. Maybe too much time  considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.  But actually  according to my research at the Institute for the Future  actually the opposite is true. Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems. In fact  I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet  we need to increase that total dramatically. I've calculated the total we need at    billion hours of game play every week. So  that's probably a bit of a counter intuitive idea  so I'll say it again  let it sink in  If we want to solve problems like hunger  poverty  climate change  global conflict  obesity  I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least    billion hours a week  by the end of the next decade. No. I'm serious. I am. Here's why. This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species. Truly. This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano. He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming  so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing. And this is a classic gaming emotion. Now  if you're not a gamer  you might miss some of the nuance in this photo. You probably see the sense of urgency  a little bit of fear  but intense concentration  deep  deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem. If you are a gamer  you will notice a few nuances here  the crinkle of the eyes up  and around the mouth is a sign of optimism  and the eyebrows up is surprise. This is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an  epic win.  Oh  you've heard of that. OK  good  so we have some gamers among us. An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive  you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it. It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination  and when you get there  you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of. That's an epic win. This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win. And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century    the face of someone who  against all odds  is on the verge of an epic win. Now  unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems. This is what I call the  I'm Not Good At Life  face. This is actually me making it. Can you see  Yes. Good. This is me making the  I'm Not Good At Life  face. This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley  California  where I did my PhD on why we're better in games than we are in real life. And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have. We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games. I don't mean just good as in successful  although that's part of it. We do achieve more in game worlds. But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters    inspired to collaborate and to cooperate. And when we're in game worlds  I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves    the most likely to help at a moment's notice  the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes  to get up after failure and try again. And in real life  when we face failure  when we confront obstacles  we often don't feel that way. We feel overcome  we feel overwhelmed  we feel anxious  maybe depressed  frustrated or cynical. We never have those feelings when we're playing games  they just don't exist in games. So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student. What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything  How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work  So I looked at games like World of Warcraft  which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment. And I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds. The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games  especially in World of Warcraft  there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission  right away. But not just any mission  it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game. Right  So you can do it. They never give you a challenge you can't achieve. But it is on the verge of what you're capable of  so you have to try hard. But there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft  no sitting around  wringing your hands    there's always something specific and important to be done. There are also tons of collaborators. Everywhere you go  hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission. That's not something we have in real life that easily  this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators. And there's this epic story  this inspiring story of why we're there  and what we're doing  and we get all this positive feedback. You guys have heard of leveling up     strength     intelligence. We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life. When I get off this stage  I'm not going to have    speaking  and    crazy idea      crazy idea. I don't get that feedback in real life. Now  the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time  we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds. It's just better than reality. So  so far  collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent  .   million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth. Now  that's not necessarily a bad thing. It might sound like it's a bad thing. But to put that in context   .   million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up. That was the first upright primate. So when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games  the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution  which is an extraordinary thing. But it's also apt  because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games  we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings. We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species. This is true. I believe this. So  consider this really interesting statistic  it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University  The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent        hours playing online games by the age of   . Now        hours is a really interesting number for two reasons. First of all  for children in the United States         hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school  from fifth grade to high school graduation  if you have perfect attendance. So  we have an entire parallel track of education going on  where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school. Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book  Outliers   so you would have heard of his theory of success  the         hours  theory of success. It's based on this great cognitive science research that says if we can master        hours of effortful study at anything by the age of     we will be virtuosos at it. We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world. And so  now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers. So  the big question is   What exactly are gamers getting so good at   Because if we could figure that out  we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands. This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games. These are our virtuoso gamers      million people who are extraordinarily good at something. And in the next decade  we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is. If you don't know it already  this is coming. The game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet  so that gamers all over the world  particularly in India  China  Brazil  can get online. They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade. It will bring us up to  .  billion gamers. So I've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at. Here are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optimism. OK  think of this as extreme self motivation. Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle  combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible  and that it's always worth trying  and trying now. Gamers don't sit around. Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric. There's a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them  even if they've beaten us badly. And the reason is  it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone. We trust that they will spend their time with us  that they will play by the same rules  value the same goal  stay with the game until it's over. And so  playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation. And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result. Blissful productivity. I love it. You know  there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for    hours a week    kind of a half time job. It's because we know  when we're playing a game  that we're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing  or hanging out. We know that we are optimized as human beings  to do hard and meaningful work. And gamers are willing to work hard all the time  if they're given the right work. Finally  epic meaning. Gamers love to be attached to awe inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories. So  just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective  So  you all know Wikipedia  biggest wiki in the world. Second biggest wiki in the world  with nearly        articles  is the World of Warcraft wiki. Five million people use it every month. They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world. They are building an epic story. They are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft. Okay  so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing  Gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals. These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world. And the only problem is  they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world. That's the problem that I'm trying to solve. There's an economist named Edward Castronova. His work is brilliant. He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds. And he says   We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments.  And he's an economist  so he's rational. And he says    Not like me  I'm a game designer  I'm exuberant. But he says that this makes perfect sense  because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life. They can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life  they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life. So he says  for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world. Now  I also agree that that is rational  for now. But it is not  by any means  an optimal situation. We have to start making the real world work more like a game. I take my inspiration from something that happened       years ago. These are ancient dice  made out of sheep's knuckles. Before we had awesome game controllers  we had sheep's knuckles. And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings  and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus  you might know this history  which is the history of who invented games and why. Herodotus says that games  particularly dice games  were invented in the kingdom of Lydia  during a time of famine. Apparently  there was such a severe famine that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy. People were suffering. People were fighting. It was an extreme situation  they needed an extreme solution. So  according to Herodotus  they invented dice games  and they set up a kingdom wide policy  On one day  everybody would eat  and on the next day  everybody would play games. And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games  because games are so engaging  and immerse us in such satisfying  blissful productivity  they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat. And then on the next day  they would play games  and on the next day  they would eat. And according to Herodotus  they passed    years this way  surviving through a famine  by eating on one day  and playing games on the next. Now  this is exactly  I think  how we're using games today. We're using games to escape real world suffering    we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment  everything that's not satisfying about real life  and we're getting what we need from games. But it doesn't have to end there. This is really exciting. According to Herodotus  after    years the famine wasn't getting better  so the king decided they would play one final dice game. They divided the entire kingdom in half. They played one dice game  and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure. They would leave Lydia  and they would go out in search of a new place to live  leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available  and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive. Now  this sounds crazy  right  But recently  DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans  who then led to the Roman Empire  actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians. And so  recently  scientists have suggested that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true. And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly    years  that could have explained the famine. So this crazy story might be true. They might have actually saved their culture by playing games  escaping to games for    years  and then been so inspired  and knew so much about how to come together with games  that they actually saved the entire civilization that way. Okay  we can do that. We've been playing Warcraft since     . That was the first real time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series. That was    years ago. They played dice games for    years  we've been playing Warcraft for    years. I say we are ready for our own epic game. Now  they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world  so that's where I get my    billion hours a week of game play from. Let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games  until we solve real world problems. Now  I know you're asking   How are we going to solve real world problems in games   Well  that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years  at the Institute for the Future. We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto  and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future. We do not want to try to predict the future. What we want to do is make the future. We want to imagine the best case scenario outcome  and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality. We want to imagine epic wins  and then give people the means to achieve the epic win. I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures. This is World Without Oil. We made this game in     . This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage. The oil shortage is fictional  but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real  and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil. So when you come to the game  you sign up  tell us where you live  and then we give you real time news videos  data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs  what's not available  how food supply is being affected  how transportation is being affected  if schools are closed  if there's rioting  and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true. And then we ask you to blog about it  to post videos  to post photos. We piloted this game with       players in       and we've tracked them for the three years since. And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience. Nobody wants to change how they live  just because it's good for the world  or because we're supposed to. But if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them   We've run out of oil. This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on. Challenge yourself to see how you would survive   most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game. So for the next world saving game  we decided to aim higher    bigger problem than just peak oil. We did a game called Superstruct at the Institute for the Future. And the premise was  a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only    years left on the planet. This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System  of course. We asked people to come online    almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies  you form a dream team    you've got the astronaut  the scientist  the ex convict  and they all have something to do to save the world. But in our game  instead of just having five people on the dream team  we said   Everybody's on the dream team  and it's your job to invent the future of energy  the future of food  the future of health  the future of security and the future of the social safety net.  We had       people play that game for eight weeks. They came up with     insanely creative solutions that you can go online  Google  Superstruct   and see. So  finally  the last game  we're launching it March  rd. This is a game done with the World Bank Institute. If you complete the game  you will be certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Innovator  class of     . Working with universities all over sub Saharan Africa  and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills. We've got a graphic novel  we've got leveling up in skills like local insight  knowledge networking  sustainability  vision and resourcefulness. I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people  anywhere in the world  particularly in developing areas  who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world. So  I'm going to wrap up now. I want to ask a question. What do you think happens next  We've got all these amazing gamers  we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do  but none of them have saved the real world yet. Well I hope you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real world work  that games are a powerful platform for change. We have all these amazing superpowers  blissful productivity  the ability to weave a tight social fabric  this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning. I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter  to survive on this planet for another century. That's my hope  that you will join me in making and playing games like this. When I look forward to the next decade  I know two things for sure  that we can make any future we can imagine  and we can play any games we want  so I say  Let the world changing games begin. Thank you.\n",
      "When we think of games  there's all kinds of things. Maybe you're ticked off  or maybe you're looking forward to a new game. You've been up too late playing a game. All these things happen to me. But when we think about games  a lot of times we think about stuff like this  first person shooters  or the big  what we would call AAA games  or maybe you're a Facebook game player. This is one my partner and I worked on. Maybe you play Facebook games  and that's what we're making right now. This is a lighter form of game. Maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in Thanksgiving situations. This would be one of those tragically boring board games that you can figure out. Or maybe you're in your living room  you know  playing with the Wii with the kids  or something like that  and  you know  there's this whole range of games  and that's very much what I think about. I make my living from games. I've been lucky enough to do this since I was     which also qualifies as I've never really had a real job. But we think about games as fun  and that's completely reasonable  but let's just think about this. So this one here  this is the      Olympics. Now I don't know where you guys were  but I was in my living room. It was practically a religious event. And this is when the Americans beat the Russians  and this was    yes  it was technically a game. Hockey is a game. But really  was this a game  I mean  people cried. I've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly. And so this was just an amazing experience. Or  you know  if anybody here is from Boston    So when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series after  I believe      years  when they won the World Series  it was amazing. I happened to be living in Springfield at the time  and the best part of it was    is that    you would close the women's door in the bathroom  and I remember seeing  Go Sox   and I thought  really  Or the houses  you'd come out  because every game  well  I think almost every game  went into overtime  right  So we'd be outside  and all the other lights are on on the whole block  and kids  like  the attendance was down in school  and kids weren't going to school. But it's okay  it's the Red Sox  right  I mean  there's education  and then there's the Red Sox  and we know where they're stacked. So this was an amazing experience  and again  yes  it was a game  but they didn't write newspaper articles  people didn't say    you know  really   I can die now because the Red Sox won.  And many people did. So games  it means something more to us. It absolutely means something more. So now  just  this is an abrupt transition here. There was three years where I actually did have a real job  sort of. I was the head of a college department teaching games  so  again  it was sort of a real job  and now I just got to talk about making as opposed to making them. And I was at a dinner. Part of the job of it  when you're a chair of a department  is to eat  and I did that very well  and so I'm out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson. So this is Zig in this photograph. This is also one of Zig's photographs. He's a photographer. And he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself  and you can see here he's got Zig's Indian Reservation. And this particular shot  this is one of the more traditional shots. This is a rain dancer. And this is one of my favorite shots here. So you can look at this  and maybe you've even seen things like this. This is an expression of culture  right  And this is actually from his Degradation series. And what was most fascinating to me about this series is just  look at that little boy there. Can you imagine  Now let's  we can see that's a traditional Native American. Now I just want to change that guy's race. Just imagine if that's a black guy. So   Honey  come here  let's get your picture with the black guy.  Right  Like  seriously  nobody would do this. It baffles the mind. And so Zig  being Indian  likewise it baffles his mind. His favorite photograph    my favorite photograph of his  which I don't have in here is Indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of Indians.  Laughter  So I happen to be at dinner with this photographer  and he was talking with another photographer about a shooting that had occurred  and it was on an Indian reservation. He'd taken his camera up there to photograph it  but when he got there  he discovered he couldn't do it. He just couldn't capture the picture. And so they were talking back and forth about this question. Do you take the picture or not  And that was fascinating to me as a game designer  because it never occurs to me  like  should I make the game about this difficult topic or not  Because we just make things that are fun or  you know  will make you feel fear  you know  that visceral excitement. But every other medium does it. So this is my kid. This is Maezza  and when she was seven years old  she came home from school one day  and like I do every single day  I asked her   What'd you do today   So she said   We talked about the Middle Passage.  Now  this was a big moment. Maezza's dad is black  and I knew this day was coming. I wasn't expecting it at seven. I don't know why  but I wasn't. Anyways  so I asked her   How do you feel about that   So she proceeded to tell me  and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here. So the ships start in England  they come down from England  they go to Africa  they go across the ocean    that's the Middle Passage part   they come to America where the slaves are sold  she's telling me. But Abraham Lincoln was elected president  and then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation  and now they're free. Pause for about    seconds.  Can I play a game  Mommy   And I thought  that's it  And so  you know  this is the Middle Passage  this is an incredibly significant event  and she's treating it like  basically some black people went on a cruise  is more or less how it sounds to her.  Laughter  And so  to me  I wanted more value in this  so when she asked if she could play a game  I said   Yes.   Laughter  And so I happened to have all of these little pieces. I'm a game designer  so I have this stuff sitting around my house. So I said   Yeah  you can play a game   and I give her a bunch of these  and I tell her to paint them in different families. These are pictures of Maezza when she was   God  it still chokes me up seeing these. So she's painting her little families. So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat. This was the boat. It was made quickly obviously.  Laughter  And so the basic gist of it is  I grabbed a bunch of families  and she's like   Mommy  but you forgot the pink baby and you forgot the blue daddy and you forgot all these other things.  And she says   They want to go.  And I said   Honey  no they don't want to go. This is the Middle Passage. Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage.  So she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother  and as we're going across the ocean  following these rules  she realizes that she's rolling pretty high  and she says to me   We're not going to make it.  And she realizes  you know  we don't have enough food  and so she asks what to do  and I say   Well  we can either     Remember  she's seven     We can either put some people in the water or we can hope that they don't get sick and we make it to the other side.  And she    just the look on her face came over and she said    now mind you this is after a month of    this is Black History Month  right  After a month she says to me   Did this really happen   And I said   Yes.  And so she said   So  if I came out of the woods    this is her brother and sister    If I came out of the woods  Avalon and Donovan might be gone.   Yes.   But I'd get to see them in America.   No.   But what if I saw them  You know  couldn't we stay together    No.   So Daddy could be gone.   Yes.  And she was fascinated by this  and she started to cry  and I started to cry  and her father started to cry  and now we're all crying. He didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage  but there it goes.  Laughter  And so  we made this game  and she got it. She got it because she spent time with these people. It wasn't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie. And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience. This is the game  which I've ended up calling The New World  because I like the phrase. I don't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships. But when this happened  I saw the whole planet. I was so excited. It was like  I'd been making games for    some years  and then I decided to do it again. My history is Irish. So this is a game called S och n Leat. It's  peace be with you.  It's the entire history of my family in a single game. I made another game called Train. I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics  and if you're going to cover a difficult topic  this is one you need to cover  and I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own. And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears. This is a game with        individual pieces. I was crazy when I decided to start it  but I'm in the middle of it now. It's the same thing. I'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games. And the one I'm working on right now  which is    because I'm right in the middle of it  and these for some reason choke me up like crazy    is a game called Mexican Kitchen Workers. And originally it was a math problem more or less. Like  here's the economics of illegal immigration. And the more I learned about the Mexican culture    my partner is Mexican   the more I learned that  you know  for all of us  food is a basic need  but  and it is obviously with Mexicans too  but it's much more than that. It's an expression of love. It's an expression of   God  I'm totally choking up way more than I thought. I'll look away from the picture. It's an expression of beauty. It's how they say they love you. It's how they say they care  and you can't hear somebody talk about their Mexican grandmother without saying  food  in the first sentence. And so to me  this beautiful culture  this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games. And so games  for a change  it changes how we see topics  it changes how our perceptions about those people in topics  and it changes ourselves. We change as people through games  because we're involved  and we're playing  and we're learning as we do so. Thank you.  Applause \n",
      "I'm a brain scientist  and as a brain scientist  I'm actually interested in how the brain learns  and I'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter  better and faster. This is in this context I'm going to tell you about video games. When we say video games  most of you think about children. It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games. But let's be frank. When the kids are in bed  who is in front of the PlayStation  Most of you. The average age of a gamer is    years old  not eight years old  and in fact  if we look at the projected demographics of video game play  the video game players of tomorrow are older adults.  Laughter  So video  gaming  is pervasive throughout our society. It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact on our everyday life. Consider these statistics released by Activision. After one month of release of the game  Call Of Duty  Black Ops   it had been played for        years worldwide  right  Would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra  So what we are asking in the lab is  how can we leverage that power  Now I want to step back a bit. I know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games. after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you  right  And I'm almost sure most of you have thought   Oh  come on  can't you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies   I'd like you to put this kind of knee jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right  Most parents would find that great. Well  I'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health. It's not  and binging is never good. But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses  actually the very game I showed you at the beginning  those action packed shooter games have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior. There's not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you  right  You're all bombarded with that. I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab. What we do in the lab is actually measure directly  in a quantitative fashion  what is the impact of video games on the brain. And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work. One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse. That's a statement about vision. There may be vision scientists among you. We actually know how to test that statement. We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is. Well  guess what  People that don't play a lot of action games  that don't actually spend a lot of time in front of screens  have normal  or what we call corrective to normal vision. That's okay. The issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week     hours per week     hours per week. By that statement  their vision should be really bad  right  Guess what  Their vision is really  really good. It's better than those that don't play. And it's better in two different ways. The first way is that they're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter  and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses  you can actually do it with just your eyesight. The other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray. Imagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident  or getting into an accident. So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision  and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better. Clearly  when it comes to action video games  screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse. Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around  Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability. Okay  we know how to measure attention in the lab. I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so. I'm going to ask you to participate  so you're going to have to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink. Right  So this is the first example.   Chair   Orange  good.   Table   Green.   Board   Audience  Red.Daphne Bavelier  Red.   Horse   DB  Yellow. Audience  Yellow.   Yellow   DB  Red. Audience  Yellow.   Blue   DB  Yellow. Okay  you get my point  right   Laughter  You're getting better  but it's hard. Why is it hard  Because I introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color. How good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict  so the young guys here at the top of their game probably  like  did a little better than some of us that are older. What we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games  they actually resolve the conflict faster. So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead to attention problems. Actually  those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention  and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world. This is something we use all the time. When you're driving  you're tracking  keeping track of the cars around you. You're also keeping track of the pedestrian  the running dog  and that's how you can actually be safe driving  right  In the lab  we get people to come to the lab  sit in front of a computer screen  and we give them little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again. You're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces. These are children in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess during the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess. But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat. Everybody begins to move around  and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes. You can track  you can track  and then when it stops  and there is a question mark  and I ask you  did this kid have a coat or not  Was it yellow initially or blue  I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain.  Laughter  I'm now going to ask you to do the task  but now with a little more challenging task. There are going to be three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes. Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated and expand  pull your attention. That's the only way you can actually do it. If you move your eyes  you're doomed. Yellow or blue  Audience  Yellow.DB  Good. So your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention. That's what we just did. Your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention  which is what is shown in this video here. That's for you guys  action video game players. A bit more challenging  right   Laughter  Yellow or blue  Blue. We have some people that are serious out there. Yeah.  Laughter  Good. So in the same way that we actually see the effects of video games on people's behavior  we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain  and we do find many changes  but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention. The other one is the frontal lobe  which controls how we sustain attention  and another one is the anterior cingulate  which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict. Now  when we do brain imaging  we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games. This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain. You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty of multitasking when you're driving and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea. Why  Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone  you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you  and so you're much more likely to get engaged into a car accident. Now  we can measure that kind of skills in the lab. We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have. That would be a little costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer where we can measure  to millisecond accuracy  how good they are at switching from one task to another. When we do that  we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really  really good. They switch really fast  very swiftly. They pay a very small cost. Now I'd like you to remember that result  and put it in the context of another group of technology users  a group which is actually much revered by society  which are people that engage in multimedia tasking. What is multimedia tasking  It's the fact that most of us  most of our children  are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they're doing search on the web at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends. That's a multimedia tasker. There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high multimedia taskers are absolutely abysmal at multitasking. When we measure them in the lab  they're really bad. Right  So these kinds of results really makes two main points. The first one is that not all media are created equal. You can't compare the effect of multimedia tasking and the effect of playing action games. They have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition  perception and attention. Even within video games  I'm telling you right now about these action packed video games. Different video games have a different effect on your brains. So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game. The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight. I showed that to you already  like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time  those action gamers have a lot of very good vision  etc. Here  what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high multimedia tasking are convinced they aced the test. So you show them their data  you show them they are bad and they're like   Not possible.  You know  they have this sort of gut feeling that  really  they are doing really  really good. That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain. Now in a sense  when we think about the effect of video games on the brain  it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health. There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some very poor uses of video games. But when consumed in reasonable doses  and at the right age  wine can be very good for health. There are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy. So it's the same way  like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity  learning  attention  vision  etc.  and so we need and we're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games  either for education or for rehabilitation of patients. Now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients  we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform. I'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game  I can actually change your vision for the better  whether you want to play that action game or not  right  That's the point of rehabilitation or education. Most of the kids don't go to school saying   Great  two hours of math   So that's really the crux of the research  and to do that  we need to go one more step. And one more step is to do training studies. So let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation. Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you  and again you're going to do the task  to look at this shape. Study it  it's a target shape  and I'm going to present to you four different shapes. One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one  the first one  second one  third one or fourth one  Okay  I'll help you. Fourth one. One more. Get those brains working. Come on. That's our target shape. Third. Good  This is hard  right  Like  the reason that I asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing  right  It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games. Well  what we do in these training studies is  people come to the lab  they do tasks like this one  we then force them to play    hours of action games. They don't play    hours of action games in a row. They do distributed practice  so little shots of    minutes several days over a period of two weeks. Then  once they are done with the training  they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague in Toronto. What they showed is that  initially  you know  subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age. After two weeks of training on action video games  they actually perform better  and the improvement is still there five months after having done the training. That's really  really important. Why  Because I told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects that are going to be long lasting. Now  at this point  a number of you are probably wondering well  what are you waiting for  to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy  or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia  for example  Well  we're working on it  but here is a challenge. There are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects  and that's what I'm going to call the broccoli side of the equation. There is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can't resist. That's the chocolate side of the equation. The issue is we need to put the two together  and it's a little bit like with food. Who really wants to eat chocolate covered broccoli  None of you.  Laughter  And you probably have had that feeling  right  picking up an education game and sort of feeling  hmm  you know  it's not really fun  it's not really engaging. So what we need is really a new brand of chocolate  a brand of chocolate that is irresistible  that you really want to play  but that has all the ingredients  the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it  but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together  people that work in the entertainment software industry  and publishers  so these are not people that usually meet every day  but it's actually doable  and we are on the right track. I'd like to leave you with that thought  and thank you for your attention.  Applause \n",
      "I'm almost like a crazy evangelical. I've always known that the age of design is upon us  almost like a rapture. If the day is sunny  I think   Oh  the gods have had a good design day.  Or  I go to a show and I see a beautiful piece by an artist  particularly beautiful  I say he's so good because he clearly looked to design to understand what he needed to do. So I really do believe that design is the highest form of creative expression. That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design  and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture  is still posters  is still fast cars  what you see at MoMA today. But in truth  what I really would like to explain to the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that the most interesting chairs are the ones that are actually made by a robot  like this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij  where a robot deposits a toothpaste like slur of recycled refrigerator parts  as if he were a big candy  and makes a chair out of it. Or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time and that become part of our identity. I want people to understand that design is so much more than cute chairs  that it is first and foremost everything that is around us in our life. And it's interesting how so much of what we're talking about tonight is not simply design but interaction design. And in fact  interaction design is what I've been trying to insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art for a few years  starting not very timidly but just pointedly with works  for instance  by Martin Wattenberg    the way a machine plays chess with itself  that you see here  or Lisa Strausfeld and her partners  the Sugar interface for One Laptop Per Child  Toshio Iwai's Tenori On musical instruments  and Philip Worthington's Shadow Monsters  and John Maeda's Reactive Books  and also Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's I Want You To Want Me. These were some of the first acquisitions that really introduced the idea of interaction design to the public. But more recently  I've been trying really to go even deeper into interaction design with examples that are emotionally really suggestive and that really explain interaction design at a level that is almost undeniable. The Wind Map  by Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi gas  I don't know if you've ever seen it    it's really fantastic. It looks at the territory of the United States as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds and that is really giving you a pictorial image of what's going on with the winds in the United States. But also  more recently  we started acquiring video games  and that's where all hell broke loose in a really interesting way.  Laughter  There are still people that believe that there's a high and there's a low. And that's really what I find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the anointment of video games in the MoMA collection. We've    No  first of all  New York Magazine always gets it. I love them. So we are in the right quadrant. We are in the Highbrow    that's daring  that's courageous    and Brilliant  which is great. Timidly  we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations  but it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good.  Laughter  But here comes the art critic. Oh  that was fantastic. So the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian.  Sorry  MoMA  video games are not art.  Did I ever say they were art  I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.  Exhibiting Pac Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh     They're two floors away.  Laughter     will mean game over for any real understanding of art.  I'm bringing in the end of the world. You know  We were talking about the rapture  It's coming. And Jonathan Jones is making it happen. So the same Guardian rebuts   Are video games art  the debate that shouldn't be. Last week  Guardian art critic blah blah suggested that games cannot qualify as art. But is he right  And does it matter   Thank you. Does it matter  You know  it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art  or the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to aspire to  would like to be called  artists. No. Designers aspire to be really great designers. Thank you very much. And that's more than enough. So my knight in shining armor  John Maeda  without any prompt  came out with this big declaration on why video games belong in the MoMA. And that was fantastic. And I thought that was it. But then there was another wonderfully pretentious article that came out in The New Republic  so pretentious  by Liel Leibovitz  and it said   MoMA has mistaken video games for art.  Again.  The museum is putting Pac Man alongside Picasso.  Again.  That misses the point.  Excuse me. You're missing the point. And here  look  the above question is put bluntly   Are video games art  No. Video games aren't art because they are quite thoroughly something else  code.  Oh  so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right  So it's so fantastic to see how these feathers that were ruffled  and these reactions  were so vehement. And you know what  The International Cat Video Film Festival didn't have that much of a reaction.  Laughter  I think this was truly fantastic. We were talking about dancing ponies  but I was really jealous of the Walker Arts Center for putting up this festival  because it's very  very wonderful. And there's this Flaubert quote that I love   I have always tried to live in an ivory tower  but a tide of shit is beating at its walls  threatening to undermine it.  I consider myself the tide of shit. You know  we have to go through that. Even in the     s  my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the customs officers that decided they were not art. So it's happened before  and it will happen in the future  but right now I can tell you that I am so  so proud to be able to call Pac Man part of the MoMA collection. And the same with  for instance  Tetris  original version  the Soviet one. And you know  the amount of work    yeah  Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government and that's how he developed Tetris  and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube that makes it look slightly bombed. And it's fantastic. So behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work  because we're still the Museum of Modern Art  so even when we tackle popular culture  we tackle it as a form of interaction design and as something that has to go into the collection at MoMA  therefore  has to be researched. So to get to choosing Eric Chahi's wonderful Another World  amongst others  we put together a panel of experts  and we worked on this acquisition  and it's mostly myself and Kate Carmody and Paul Galloway. We worked on it for a year and a half. So many people helped us   designers of games  you might know Jamin Warren and his collaborators at Kill Screen magazine  and you know  Kevin Slavin. You name it. We bugged everybody  because we knew that we were ignorant. We were not real gamers enough  so we had to really talk to them. And so we decided  of course  to have Sim City       not the other Sim City  that one in particular  so the criteria that we developed along the way were really strong  and were not only criteria of selection. They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation. That's what makes this acquisition more than a little game or a little joke. It's truly a way to think of how to preserve and show artifacts that will more and more become part of our lives in the future. We live today  as you know very well  not in the digital  not in the physical  but in the kind of minestrone that our mind makes of the two. And that's really where interaction lies  and that's the importance of interaction. And in order to explain interaction  we need to really bring people in and make them realize how interaction is part of their lives. So when I talk about it  I don't talk only about video games  which are in a way the purest form of interaction  unadulterated by any kind of function or finality. I also talk about the MetroCard vending machine  which I consider a masterpiece of interaction. I mean  that interface is beautiful. It looks like a burly MTA guy coming out of the tunnel. You know  with your mitt you can actually paw the MetroCard  and I talk about how bad ATM machines usually are. So I let people understand that it's up to them to know how to judge interaction so as to know when it's good or when it's bad. So when I show The Sims  I try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with The Sims  not only the fun but also the responsibility that came with the Tamagotchi. You know  video games can be truly deep even when they're completely mindless. I'm sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy. It's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can in a finite amount of time and hopefully you'll be able to make it into a planet. I've never made it into a planet  but that's it. Or  you know  Vib Ribbon was not distributed here in the United States. It was a PlayStation game  but mostly for Japan. And it was one of the first video games in which you could choose your own music. So you would put into the PlayStation  you would put your own CD  and then the game would change alongside your music. So really fantastic. Not to mention Eve Online. Eve Online is an artificial universe  if you wish  but one of the diplomats that was killed in Benghazi  not Ambassador Stevens  but one of his collaborators  was a really big shot in Eve Online  so here you have a diplomat in the real world that spends his time in Eve Online to kind of test  maybe  all of his ideas about diplomacy and about universe building  and to the point that the first announcement of the bombing was actually given on Eve Online  and after his death  several parts of the universe were named after him. And I was just recently at the Eve Online fan festival in Reykjav k that was quite amazing. I mean  we're talking about an experience that of course can seem weird to many  but that is very educational. Of course  there are games that are even more educational. Dwarf Fortress is like the holy grail of this kind of massive multiplayer online game  and in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjav k  and they were greeted by a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans. It was amazing to see. And it's a beautiful game. So you start seeing here that the aesthetics that are so important to a museum collection like MoMA's are kept alive also by the selection of these games. And you know  Valve    you know  Portal    is an example of a video game in which you have a certain type of violence which also leads me to talk about one of the biggest issues that we had to discuss when we acquired the video games  what to do with violence. Right  We had to make decisions. At MoMA  interestingly  there's a lot of violence depicted in the art part of the collection  but when I came to MoMA    years ago  and as an Italian  I said   You know what  we need a Beretta.  And I was told   No. No guns in the design collection.  And I was like   Why   Interestingly  I learned that it's considered that in design and in the design collection  what you see is what you get. So when you see a gun  it's an instrument for killing in the design collection. If it's in the art collection  it might be a critique of the killing instrument. So it's very interesting. But we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design  so maybe one day we'll be able to acquire also the guns. But here  in this particular case  we decided  you know  with Kate and Paul  that we would have no gratuitous violence. So we have Portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces. We have Street Fighter II  because martial arts are good. But we don't have GTA because  maybe it's my own reflection  I've never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps. So it was not very constructive.  Laughter  So  I'm making fun of it  but we discussed this for so many days. You have no idea. And to this day  I am ambivalent  but when you have instead games like Flow  there's no doubt. It's like  it's about serenity and it's about sublime. It's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature. Then we have a few also side scrollers    classical ones. So it's quite a hefty collection. And right now  we started with the first     but we have several that are coming up  and the reason why we haven't acquired them yet is because you don't acquire just the game. You acquire the relationship with the company. What we want  what we aspire to  is the code. It's very hard to get  of course. But that's what would enable us to preserve the video games for a really long time  and that's what museums do. They also preserve artifacts for posterity. In absence of the code  because  you know  video game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases  in absence of that  we acquire the relationship with the company. We're going to stay with them forever. They're not going to get rid of us. And one day  we'll get that code.  Laughter  But I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose for interaction design. Aesthetics are really important. And I'm showing you Core War here  which is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically of the limitations of the processor. So the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness  which is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important. And so is space  the spatial aspect of games. You know  I feel that the best video games are the ones that have really savvy architects that are behind them  and if they're not architects  bona fide trained in architecture  they have that feeling. But the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important. Time. The way we experience time in video games  as in other forms of interaction design  is really quite amazing. It can be real time or it can be the time within the game  as is in Animal Crossing  where seasons follow each other at their own pace. So time  space  aesthetics  and then  most important  behavior. The real core issue of interaction design is behavior. Designers that deal with interaction design behaviors that go to influence the rest of our lives. They're not just limited to our interaction with the screen. In this case  I'm showing you Marble Madness  which is a beautiful game in which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you  so you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape  and the sphere  the controller itself  gives you a sense of the movement. In a way  you can see how video games are the purest aspect of interaction design and are very useful to explain what interaction is. We don't want to show the video games with the paraphernalia. No arcade nostalgia. If anything  we want to show the code  and here you see Ben Fry's distellamap of Pac Man  of the Pac Man code. So the way we acquired the games is very interesting and very unorthodox. You see them here displayed alongside other examples of design  furniture and other parts  but there's no paraphernalia  no nostalagia  only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers. The controllers are  of course  part of the experience  so you cannot do away with it. But interestingly  this choice was not condemned too vehemently by gamers. I was afraid that they would kill us  and instead they understood  especially when I told them that I was trying to apply the same stratagem that Philip Johnson applied in      when he wanted to make people understand the importance of design  and he took propeller blades and pieces of machinery and in the MoMA galleries he put them on white pedestals against white walls  as if they were Brancusi sculptures. He created this strange distance  this shock  that made people realize how gorgeous formally  and also important functionally  design pieces were. I would like to do the same with video games. By getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts and everything else that we might remember from our childhood  I want people to understand that those are important forms of design. And in a way  the video games  the fonts and everything else lead us to make people understand a wider meaning for design. One of my dream acquisitions  which has been on hold for a few years but now will come back on the front burner  is a    . I would like to acquire it  but without owning it. I don't want it to be at MoMA and possessed by MoMA. I want it to keep flying. So it's an acquisition where MoMA makes an arrangement with an airline and keeps the Boeing     flying. And the same with the     sign that we acquired a few years ago. It was the first example of an acquisition of something that is in the public domain. And what I say to people  it's almost as if a butterfly were flying by and we captured the shadow on the wall  and just we're showing the shadow. So in a way  we're showing a manifestation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have. And it's too long to explain the acquisition  but if you want to go on the MoMA blog  there's a long post where I explain why it's such a great example of design. Along the way  I've had to burn a few chairs. You know  I've had to do away with a few concepts of design past. But I see that people are coming along  that the audiences  paradoxically  are much more responsive and much more understanding of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are. Design is truly everywhere  and design is as important as anything  and I'm so glad that  because of its diversity and because of its centrality to our lives  many more people are coming to it as a profession  as a passion  and as  very simply  part of their own culture. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling  but whose streets we can't walk. By studying those twinkling lights though  we can learn about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life. In this image of the Tokyo skyline  I've hidden data from the newest planet hunting space telescope on the block  the Kepler Mission. Can you see it  There we go. This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at  where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over         stars  all at once  every half hour  and very precisely. And what we're looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us. In just over two years of operations  we've found over       potential new planetary systems around other stars. To give you some perspective  in the previous two decades of searching  we had only known about     prior to Kepler. When we see these little dips in the light  we can determine a number of things. For one thing  we can determine that there's a planet there  but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star. That distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall. And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire  You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm  but not so close that you're too toasty and you get burned. However  there's more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall. And I'll tell you why. This is our star. This is our Sun. It's shown here in visible light. That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes. You'll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball    that Sun that we all draw when we're children. But you'll notice something else  and that's that the face of the Sun has freckles. These freckles are called sunspots  and they are just one of the manifestations of the Sun's magnetic field. They also cause the light from the star to vary. And we can measure this very  very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects. However  these are just the tip of the iceberg. If we had UV eyes or X ray eyes  we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our Sun's magnetic activity    the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well. Just think  even when it's cloudy outside  these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time. So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable  whether it might be amenable to life  we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is  but we want to know about its space weather    this high energy radiation  the UV and the X rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high energy radiation. And so  we can't really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system. I'm showing here Venus  Earth and Mars    three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size  but only one of which is really a good place to live. But what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe. Kepler won't find a planet around every single star it looks at. But really  every measurement it makes is precious  because it's teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets  and how it's really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe. While it's Kepler the telescope  the instrument that stares  it's we  life  who are searching. Thank you.\n",
      "I'm here to tell you about the real search for alien life. Not little green humanoids arriving in shiny UFOs  although that would be nice. But it's the search for planets orbiting stars far away. Every star in our sky is a sun. And if our sun has planets    Mercury  Venus  Earth  Mars  etc.  surely those other stars should have planets also  and they do. And in the last two decades  astronomers have found thousands of exoplanets. Our night sky is literally teeming with exoplanets. We know  statistically speaking  that every star has at least one planet. And in the search for planets  and in the future  planets that might be like Earth  we're able to help address some of the most amazing and mysterious questions that have faced humankind for centuries. Why are we here  Why does our universe exist  How did Earth form and evolve  How and why did life originate and populate our planet  The second question that we often think about is  Are we alone  Is there life out there  Who is out there  You know  this question has been around for thousands of years  since at least the time of the Greek philosophers. But I'm here to tell you just how close we're getting to finding out the answer to this question. It's the first time in human history that this really is within reach for us. Now when I think about the possibilities for life out there  I think of the fact that our sun is but one of many stars. This is a photograph of a real galaxy  we think our Milky Way looks like this galaxy. It's a collection of bound stars. But our  sun  is one of hundreds of billions of stars and our galaxy is one of upwards of hundreds of billions of galaxies. Knowing that small planets are very common  you can just do the math. And there are just so many stars and so many planets out there  that surely  there must be life somewhere out there. Well  the biologists get furious with me for saying that  because we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond Earth yet. Well  if we were able to look at our galaxy from the outside and zoom in to where our sun is  we see a real map of the stars. And the highlighted stars are those with known exoplanets. This is really just the tip of the iceberg. Here  this animation is zooming in onto our solar system. And you'll see here the planets as well as some spacecraft that are also orbiting our sun. Now if we can imagine going to the West Coast of North America  and looking out at the night sky  here's what we'd see on a spring night. And you can see the constellations overlaid and again  so many stars with planets. There's a special patch of the sky where we have thousands of planets. This is where the Kepler Space Telescope focused for many years. Let's zoom in and look at one of the favorite exoplanets. This star is called Kepler    f. It's a system of about five planets. And by the way  most of these exoplanets  we don't know too much about. We know their size  and their orbit and things like that. But there's a very special planet here called Kepler    f. This planet is in a zone that is not too far from the star  so that the temperature may be just right for life. Here  the artist's conception is just zooming in and showing you what that planet might be like. So  many people have this romantic notion of astronomers going to the telescope on a lonely mountaintop and looking at the spectacular night sky through a big telescope. But actually  we just work on our computers like everyone else  and we get our data by email or downloading from a database. So instead of coming here to tell you about the somewhat tedious nature of the data and data analysis and the complex computer models we make  I have a different way to try to explain to you some of the things that we're thinking about exoplanets. Here's a travel poster   Kepler    f  Where the grass is always redder on the other side.  That's because Kepler    f orbits a red star  and we're just speculating that perhaps the plants there  if there is vegetation that does photosynthesis  it has different pigments and looks red.  Enjoy the gravity on HD      g  a Super Earth.  This planet is more massive than Earth and has a higher surface gravity.  Relax on Kepler   b  where your shadow always has company.  We know of a dozen planets that orbit two stars  and there's likely many more out there. If we could visit one of those planets  you literally would see two sunsets and have two shadows. So actually  science fiction got some things right. Tatooine from Star Wars. And I have a couple of other favorite exoplanets to tell you about. This one is Kepler   b  it's a hot  hot planet. It orbits over    times closer to its star than our Earth does to our sun. And actually  it's so hot  we can't visit any of these planets  but if we could  we would melt long before we got there. We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock and has liquid lava lakes. Gliese     b. This planet  we know the mass and the size and it has a fairly low density. It's somewhat warm. We actually don't know really anything about this planet  but one possibility is that it's a water world  like a scaled up version of one of Jupiter's icy moons that might be    percent water by mass. And in this case  it would have a thick steam atmosphere overlaying an ocean  not of liquid water  but of an exotic form of water  a superfluid    not quite a gas  not quite a liquid. And under that wouldn't be rock  but a form of high pressure ice  like ice IX. So out of all these planets out there  and the variety is just simply astonishing  we mostly want to find the planets that are Goldilocks planets  we call them. Not too big  not too small  not too hot  not too cold    but just right for life. But to do that  we'd have to be able to look at the planet's atmosphere  because the atmosphere acts like a blanket trapping heat    the greenhouse effect. We have to be able to assess the greenhouse gases on other planets. Well  science fiction got some things wrong. The Star Trek Enterprise had to travel vast distances at incredible speeds to orbit other planets so that First Officer Spock could analyze the atmosphere to see if the planet was habitable or if there were lifeforms there. Well  we don't need to travel at warp speeds to see other planet atmospheres  although I don't want to dissuade any budding engineers from figuring out how to do that. We actually can and do study planet atmospheres from here  from Earth orbit. This is a picture  a photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope taken by the shuttle Atlantis as it was departing after the last human space flight to Hubble. They installed a new camera  actually  that we use for exoplanet atmospheres. And so far  we've been able to study dozens of exoplanet atmospheres  about six of them in great detail. But those are not small planets like Earth. They're big  hot planets that are easy to see. We're not ready  we don't have the right technology yet to study small exoplanets. But nevertheless  I wanted to try to explain to you how we study exoplanet atmospheres. I want you to imagine  for a moment  a rainbow. And if we could look at this rainbow closely  we would see that some dark lines are missing. And here's our sun  the white light of our sun split up  not by raindrops  but by a spectrograph. And you can see all these dark  vertical lines. Some are very narrow  some are wide  some are shaded at the edges. And this is actually how astronomers have studied objects in the heavens  literally  for over a century. So here  each different atom and molecule has a special set of lines  a fingerprint  if you will. And that's how we study exoplanet atmospheres. And I'll just never forget when I started working on exoplanet atmospheres    years ago  how many people told me   This will never happen. We'll never be able to study them. Why are you bothering   And that's why I'm pleased to tell you about all the atmospheres studied now  and this is really a field of its own. So when it comes to other planets  other Earths  in the future when we can observe them  what kind of gases would we be looking for  Well  you know  our own Earth has oxygen in the atmosphere to    percent by volume. That's a lot of oxygen. But without plants and photosynthetic life  there would be no oxygen  virtually no oxygen in our atmosphere. So oxygen is here because of life. And our goal then is to look for gases in other planet atmospheres  gases that don't belong  that we might be able to attribute to life. But which molecules should we search for  I actually told you how diverse exoplanets are. We expect that to continue in the future when we find other Earths. And that's one of the main things I'm working on now  I have a theory about this. It reminds me that nearly every day  I receive an email or emails from someone with a crazy theory about physics of gravity or cosmology or some such. So  please don't email me one of your crazy theories. Well  I had my own crazy theory. But  who does the MIT professor go to  Well  I emailed a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine and he said   Sure  come and talk to me.  So I brought my two biochemistry friends and we went to talk to him about our crazy theory. And that theory was that life produces all small molecules  so many molecules. Like  everything I could think of  but not being a chemist. Think about it  carbon dioxide  carbon monoxide  molecular hydrogen  molecular nitrogen  methane  methyl chloride    so many gases. They also exist for other reasons  but just life even produces ozone. So we go to talk to him about this  and immediately  he shot down the theory. He found an example that didn't exist. So  we went back to the drawing board and we think we have found something very interesting in another field. But back to exoplanets  the point is that life produces so many different types of gases  literally thousands of gases. And so what we're doing now is just trying to figure out on which types of exoplanets  which gases could be attributed to life. And so when it comes time when we find gases in exoplanet atmospheres that we won't know if they're being produced by intelligent aliens or by trees  or a swamp  or even just by simple  single celled microbial life. So working on the models and thinking about biochemistry  it's all well and good. But a really big challenge ahead of us is  how  How are we going to find these planets  There are actually many ways to find planets  several different ways. But the one that I'm most focused on is how can we open a gateway so that in the future  we can find hundreds of Earths. We have a real shot at finding signs of life. And actually  I just finished leading a two year project in this very special phase of a concept we call the starshade. And the starshade is a very specially shaped screen and the goal is to fly that starshade so it blocks out the light of a star so that the telescope can see the planets directly. Here  you can see myself and two team members holding up one small part of the starshade. It's shaped like a giant flower  and this is one of the prototype petals. The concept is that a starshade and telescope could launch together  with the petals unfurling from the stowed position. The central truss would expand  with the petals snapping into place. Now  this has to be made very precisely  literally  the petals to microns and they have to deploy to millimeters. And this whole structure would have to fly tens of thousands of kilometers away from the telescope. It's about tens of meters in diameter. And the goal is to block out the starlight to incredible precision so that we'd be able to see the planets directly. And it has to be a very special shape  because of the physics of defraction. Now this is a real project that we worked on  literally  you would not believe how hard. Just so you believe it's not just in movie format  here's a real photograph of a second generation starshade deployment test bed in the lab. And in this case  I just wanted you to know that that central truss has heritage left over from large radio deployables in space. So after all of that hard work where we try to think of all the crazy gases that might be out there  and we build the very complicated space telescopes that might be out there  what are we going to find  Well  in the best case  we will find an image of another exo Earth. Here is Earth as a pale blue dot. And this is actually a real photograph of Earth taken by the Voyager   spacecraft  four billion miles away. And that red light is just scattered light in the camera optics. But what's so awesome to consider is that if there are intelligent aliens orbiting on a planet around a star near to us and they build complicated space telescopes of the kind that we're trying to build  all they'll see is this pale blue dot  a pinprick of light. And so sometimes  when I pause to think about my professional struggle and huge ambition  it's hard to think about that in contrast to the vastness of the universe. But nonetheless  I am devoting the rest of my life to finding another Earth. And I can guarantee that in the next generation of space telescopes  in the second generation  we will have the capability to find and identity other Earths. And the capability to split up the starlight so that we can look for gases and assess the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  estimate the surface temperature  and look for signs of life. But there's more. In this case of searching for other planets like Earth  we are making a new kind of map of the nearby stars and of the planets orbiting them  including  planets  that actually might be inhabitable by humans. And so I envision that our descendants  hundreds of years from now  will embark on an interstellar journey to other worlds. And they will look back at all of us as the generation who first found the Earth like worlds. Thank you. June Cohen  And I give you  for a question  Rosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen. Fred Jansen  You mentioned halfway through that the technology to actually look at the spectrum of an exoplanet like Earth is not there yet. When do you expect this will be there  and what's needed  Actually  what we expect is what we call our next generation Hubble telescope. And this is called the James Webb Space Telescope  and that will launch in       and that's what we're going to do  we're going to look at a special kind of planet called transient exoplanets  and that will be our first shot at studying small planets for gases that might indicate the planet is habitable. JC  I'm going to ask you one follow up question  too  Sara  as the generalist. So I am really struck by the notion in your career of the opposition you faced  that when you began thinking about exoplanets  there was extreme skepticism in the scientific community that they existed  and you proved them wrong. What did it take to take that on  SS  Well  the thing is that as scientists  we're supposed to be skeptical  because our job to make sure that what the other person is saying actually makes sense or not. But being a scientist  I think you've seen it from this session  it's like being an explorer. You have this immense curiosity  this stubbornness  this sort of resolute will that you will go forward no matter what other people say. JC  I love that. Thank you  Sara.\n",
      "Well  indeed  I'm very  very lucky. My talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months    seemingly unrelated  but as you will see  actually all having to do with the story I want to tell you today. The first one was actually a funeral    to be more precise  a reburial. On May   nd  there was a hero's reburial in Frombork  Poland of the   th century astronomer who actually changed the world. He did that  literally  by replacing the Earth with the Sun in the center of the Solar System  and then with this simple looking act  he actually launched a scientific and technological revolution  which many call the Copernican Revolution. Now that was  ironically  and very befittingly  the way we found his grave. As it was the custom of the time  Copernicus was actually simply buried in an unmarked grave  together with    others in that cathedral. DNA analysis  one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last     years that he started  was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was Copernicus' hair    obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on. That match was unambiguous. The DNA matched  and we know that this was indeed Nicolaus Copernicus. Now  the connection between biology and DNA and life is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus because  even back then  his followers very quickly made the logical step to ask  if the Earth is just a planet  then what about planets around other stars  What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds  about life on other planets  In fact  I'm borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time. And at the time  people actually answered that question positively   Yes.  But there was no evidence. And here begins     years of frustration  of unfulfilled dreams    the dreams of Galileo  Giordano Bruno  many others    which never led to the answer of those very basic questions which humanity has asked all the time.  What is life  What is the origin of life  Are we alone   And that especially happened in the last    years  at the end of the   th century  when the beautiful developments due to molecular biology  understanding the code of life  DNA  all of that seemed to actually put us  not closer  but further apart from answering those basic questions. Now  the good news. A lot has happened in the last few years  and let's start with the planets. Let's start with the old Copernican question  Are there earths around other stars  And as we already heard  there is a way in which we are trying  and now able  to answer that question. It's a new telescope. Our team  befittingly I think  named it after one of those dreamers of the Copernican time  Johannes Kepler  and that telescope's sole purpose is to go out  find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy  and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth happen to be out there. The telescope is actually built similarly to the  well known to you  Hubble Space Telescope  except it does have an additional lens    a wide field lens  as you would call it as a photographer. And if  in the next couple of months  you walk out in the early evening and look straight up and place you palm like this  you will actually be looking at the field of the sky where this telescope is searching for planets day and night  without any interruption  for the next four years. The way we do that  actually  is with a method  which we call the transit method. It's actually mini eclipses that occur when a planet passes in front of its star. Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented for us to be able do that  but if you have a million stars  you'll find enough planets. And as you see on this animation  what Kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star. We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this. All the stars for Kepler are just points of light. But we learn a lot from that  not only that there is a planet there  but we also learn its size. How much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is. We learn about its orbit  the period of its orbit and so on. So  what have we learned  Well  let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand the news that I'm here to tell you today. What Kepler does is discover a lot of candidates  which we then follow up and find as planets  confirm as planets. It basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size. There are small planets  there are bigger planets  there are big planets  okay. So we count many  many such planets  and they have different sizes. We do that in our solar system. In fact  even back during the ancients  the Solar System in that sense would look on a diagram like this. There will be the smaller planets  and there will be the big planets  even back to the time of Epicurus and then of course Copernicus and his followers. Up until recently  that was the Solar System    four Earth like planets with small radius  smaller than about two times the size of the Earth    and that was of course Mercury  Venus  Mars  and of course the Earth  and then the two big  giant planets. Then the Copernican Revolution brought in telescopes  and of course three more planets were discovered. Now the total planet number in our solar system was nine. The small planets dominated  and there was a certain harmony to that  which actually Copernicus was very happy to note  and Kepler was one of the big proponents of. So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets. But up until  literally     years ago  that was all we knew about planets. And that's what the frustration was. The Copernican dream was unfulfilled. Finally     years ago  the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star  and we actually did pretty well. In the next    years  almost     planets were discovered orbiting other stars  with different methods. Unfortunately  as you can see  there was a very different picture. There was of course an explanation for it  We only see the big planets  so that's why most of those planets are really in the category of  like Jupiter.  But you see  we haven't gone very far. We were still back where Copernicus was. We didn't have any evidence whether planets like the Earth are out there. And we do care about planets like the Earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate  to emerge  to survive. And we didn't have the evidence for that. So today  I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope  Kepler  has been able to tell us in the last few weeks  and  lo and behold  we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus. You can see here  the small planets dominate the picture. The planets which are marked  like Earth    are  definitely more than any other planets that we see. And now for the first time  we can say that. There is a lot more work we need to do with this. Most of these are candidates. In the next few years we will confirm them. But the statistical result is loud and clear. And the statistical result is that planets like our own Earth are out there. Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets. So the question is  what do we do next  Well  first of all  we can study them now that we know where they are. And we can find those that we would call habitable  meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on Earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen. So  we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own Milky Way Galaxy harbors. And the number  as you might expect  is pretty staggering. It's about     million such planets. That's great news. Why  Because with our own little telescope  just in the next two years  we'll be able to identify at least    of them. So that's great because then we can go and study them    remotely  of course    with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years. We can find what they're made of  would their atmospheres have water  carbon dioxide  methane. We know and expect that we'll see that. That's great  but that is not the whole news. That's not why I'm here. Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part. The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next. And here comes biology    biology  with its basic question  which still stands unanswered  which is essentially   If there is life on other planets  do we expect it to be like life on Earth   And let me immediately tell you here  when I say life  I don't mean  dolce vita   good life  human life. I really mean life on Earth  past and present  from microbes to us humans  in its rich molecular diversity  the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions    and we call that  collectively  biochemistry  life as a chemical process  as a chemical phenomenon. So the question is  is that chemical phenomenon universal  or is it something which depends on the planet  Is it like gravity  which is the same everywhere in the universe  or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them  We need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that. And that's a very basic question  which we don't know the answer to  but which we can try    and we are trying    to answer in the lab. We don't need to go to space to answer that question. And so  that's what we are trying to do. And that's what many people now are trying to do. And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well. So this is one example that I want to show you here. When we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life  we think of compartmentalization  keeping the molecules which are important for life in a membrane  isolated from the rest of the environment  but yet  in an environment in which they actually could originate together. And in one of our labs  Jack Szostak's labs  it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environments    which are very common on planets  on certain types of planets like the Earth  where you have some liquid water and some clays    you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles. But those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living thing on Earth looks like  like this. And they really help molecules  like nucleic acids  like RNA and DNA  stay inside  develop  change  divide and do some of the processes that we call life. Now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon. And in a sense  you can think of that work that people are starting to do now around the world as building a bridge  building a bridge from two sides of the river. On one hand  on the left bank of the river  are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments. We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities  and there is not too much lab  and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments. So that's what we are building from the left side of the river. From the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you  where we actually tried that  and it feeds back and forth  and we hope to meet in the middle one day. So why should you care about that  Why am I trying to sell you a half built bridge  Am I that charming  Well  there are many reasons  and you heard some of them in the short talk today. This understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives. But there is something more profound here  something deeper. And that deeper  underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it. And that is going to change our worldview in a profound way    not in a dissimilar way as     years ago  Copernicus' act did  by changing the way we view space and time. Now it's about something else  but it's equally profound. And half the time  what's happened is it's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind  to the Earth in a bigger space. And the more we learn  the more that was reinforced. You've all learned that in school    how small the Earth is compared to the immense universe. And the bigger the telescope  the bigger that universe becomes. And look at this image of the tiny  blue dot. This pixel is the Earth. It is the Earth as we know it. It is seen from  in this case  from outside the orbit of Saturn. But it's really tiny. We know that. Let's think of life as that entire planet because  in a sense  it is. The biosphere is the size of the Earth. Life on Earth is the size of the Earth. And let's compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms. What if that Copernican insignificance was actually all wrong  Would that make us more responsible for what is happening today  Let's actually try that. So in space  the Earth is very small. Can you imagine how small it is  Let me try it. Okay  let's say this is the size of the observable universe  with all the galaxies  with all the stars  okay  from here to here. Do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be  It will be the size of a single  small atom. It is unimaginably small. We can't imagine it. I mean look  you can see the necktie  but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little  small atom. But that's not the whole story  you see. The universe and life are both in space and time. If that was the age of the universe  then this is the age of life on Earth. Think about those oldest living things on Earth  but in a cosmic proportion. This is not insignificant. This is very significant. So life might be insignificant in size  but it is not insignificant in time. Life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent  parent and offspring. So what does this tell us  This tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the Copernican principle  it's all wrong. There is immense  powerful potential in life in this universe    especially now that we know that places like the Earth are common. And that potential  that powerful potential  is also our potential  of you and me. And if we are to be stewards of our planet Earth and its biosphere  we'd better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it. And the good news is we can actually  indeed do it. And let's do it. Let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one  with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future. And let's hope that we can build this bridge together and meet in the middle. Thank you very much.\n",
      "I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists. I can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess. But I know that it's there. And understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it. On our planet  where there's water  there's life. So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars. At this distance  shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures  planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside. Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars. What I do picks up where their job ends. I model the possible climates of exoplanets. And here's why that's important  there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life. Take the planet Venus. It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty  because of its benign  ethereal appearance in the sky. But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story. The surface temperature is close to     degrees Fahrenheit      Celsius. That's hot enough to melt lead. Its thick atmosphere  not its distance from the sun  is the reason. It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids  trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface. The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet. From these lessons from our own solar system  we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life. We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us. For example  one of the closest planets that could support surface water    it's called Gliese     Cc    such a glamorous name  right  nice phone number for a name    it's    light years away. So that's more than     trillion miles. Trying to measure the atmospheric composition of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard. It's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car's headlight. OK  now imagine that car is     trillion miles away  and you want to know the precise color of that fly. So I use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life. Here's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler   f  with the Earth for reference. It's       light years away  and just    percent larger than Earth. Our NSF funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit. So I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life. Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate. Ice absorbs longer  redder wavelengths of light  and reflects shorter  bluer light. That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue. The redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice. Only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom. Then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes and we see blue ice. My models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars. There's another contradiction    that ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars  and that light  that energy  heats the ice. Using climate models to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere. And it's no surprise that this is my specialty. I'm an African American female astronomer and a classically trained actor who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines  so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature    ... and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists. My organization  Rising Stargirls  teaches astronomy to middle school girls of color  using theater  writing and visual art. That's another contradiction    science and art don't often go together  but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn  and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions  and use their backgrounds to discover  once and for all  that we are truly not alone in the universe. Thank you.\n",
      "I have a very difficult task. I'm a spectroscopist. I have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies  etc. because my job is spectroscopy. I never deal with images. But I'll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world. Spectroscopy can probably answer the question   Is there anybody out there   Are we alone  SETI. It's not very fun to do spectroscopy. One of my colleagues in Bulgaria  Nevena Markova  spent about    years studying these profiles. And she published    articles just dedicated to the subject. Can you imagine  Day and night  thinking  observing  the same star for    years is incredible. But we are crazy. We do these things. And I'm not that far. I spent about eight months working on these profiles. Because I've noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars. And I thought  well maybe there is Lithium   in this star  which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet. Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope of Lithium   in the atmospheres of sun like stars. But you have it in planets and asteroids. So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids  you will have this Lithium   isotope in the spectrum of the star. So I invested more than eight months just studying the profile of this star. And actually it's amazing  because I got phone calls from many reporters asking   Have you actually seen the planet going into a star   Because they thought that if you are having a telescope  you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope. And you might have seen the planet going into a star. And I was saying   No  excuse me. What I see is this one.  It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really. I bet that there were very few people who really understood what I'm talking about. Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star. It's amazing. The power of spectroscopy was actually realized by Pink Floyd already in     . Because they actually said that you can get any color you like in a spectrum. And all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph. This is the number one high resolution  most precise spectrograph on this planet  called HARPS  which is actually used to detect extrasolar planets and sound waves in the atmospheres of stars. How we get spectra  I'm sure most of you know from school physics that it's basically splitting a white light into colors. And if you have a liquid hot mass  it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum. A hot gas is producing emission lines only  no continuum. And if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source  you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines. Which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter  which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies. Now  what we can do with the spectra  We can actually study line of sight velocities of cosmic objects. And we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars  galaxies  nebulae. A star is the most simple object. In the core  we have thermonuclear reactions going on  creating chemical elements. And we have a cool atmosphere. It's cool for me. Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees. My colleagues in infra red astronomy call minus     Kelvin is cool for them. But you know  everything is relative. So for me       degrees is pretty cool. This is the spectrum of the Sun           spectral lines  and about    percent of these lines is not yet identified. It is amazing. So we are in the   st century  and we still cannot properly understand the spectrum of the sun. Sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny  weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere. For instance  you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun. And we use this weak feature to measure the composition of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun. And now this is a work in progress. We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature  which belongs to osmium. It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae. It's the only place where you can produce  actually  osmium. Just comparing the composition of osmium in one of the planet host stars  we want to understand why there is so much of this element. Perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars. It can be an indication. The other day  my colleague from Berkeley  Gibor Basri  emailed me a very interesting spectrum  asking me   Can you have a look at this   And I couldn't sleep  next two weeks  when I saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars. I knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy. It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system  which polluted the atmosphere of this star. And later a black hole was formed in a binary system  which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses. This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions. My colleagues  comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars  actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy. It's amazing that you can go so far simply studying the chemical composition of stars. They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy. There is interaction of galaxies. We know this. And sometimes they just capture stars. You've heard about solar flares. We were very surprised to discover a super flare  a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the Sun. In one of the binary stars in our galaxy called FH Leo  we discovered the super flare. And later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything strange with these objects. And we found that everything is normal. These stars are normal like the Sun. Age  everything was normal. So this is a mystery. It's one of the mysteries we still have  super flares. And there are six or seven similar cases reported in the literature. Now to go ahead with this  we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe. It's very complicated. I don't really want you to try to understand what is here. But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story of the production of chemical elements. You have two channels    the massive stars and low mass stars    producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe. And doing this for    billion years  we end up with this picture  which is a very important graph  showing relative abundances of chemical elements in sun like stars and in the interstellar medium. So which means that it's really impossible to find an object where you find about    times more sulfur than silicon  five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible. And if you find one  I will say that this is something related to SETI  because naturally you can't do it. Doppler Effect is something very important from fundamental physics. And this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source. The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets. The precision which we need to discover a Jupiter like planet around a sun like star is something like   .  meters per second. And we need nine centimeters per second to detect an Earth like planet. This can be done with the future spectrographs. I  myself  I'm actually involved in the team which is developing a CODEX  high resolution  future generation spectrograph for the    meter E ELT telescope. And this is going to be an instrument to detect Earth like planets around sun like stars. It is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars. This is the sound of an Alpha Cen. We can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun like stars. Those waves have frequencies in infrasound domain  the sound actually nobody knows  domain. Coming back to the most important question   Is there anybody out there   This is closely related to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets. Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward. No life without tectonic activity  without volcanic activity. And we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of uranium  thorium  and potassium. How to measure  if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small  so those planets are tectonically dead  there cannot be life. If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium  probably  again  there would be no life. Because can you imagine everything boiling  It's too much energy on a planet. Now  we have been measuring abundance of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets. It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature. We are actually trying to measure this profile and to detect thorium. It's very tough. It's very tough. And you have to  first you have to convince yourself. Then you have to convince your colleagues. And then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in     parsec away from here. It's really difficult. But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets  you have to do this job. Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems. The one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals. If you receive something interesting  well that's what SETI does actually  what SETI has been doing for many years. I think the most promising way is to go for biomarkers. You can see the spectrum of the Earth  this Earthshine spectrum  and that is a very clear signal. The slope which is coming  which we call a Red Edge  is a detection of vegetated area. It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum. Now imagine doing this test for other planets. Now very recently  very recently  I'm talking about last six  seven  eight months  water  methane  carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system. It's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy. You can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far  far  far from solar system. We have to detect oxygen or ozone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions to have life. Cosmic miracles are something which can be related to SETI. Now imagine an object  amazing object  or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say   Look  we give up. Physics doesn't work.  So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say   Well  somebody must be doing this  somehow.  And with the known physics etc  it's something actually which has been pointed out by Frank Drake  many years ago  and Shklovsky. If you see  in the spectrum of a planet host star  if you see strange chemical elements  it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it. They want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines  in the spectrum of a star  in different ways. There can be different ways doing this. One is  for instance  technetium is a radioactive element with a decay time of  .  million years. If you suddenly observe technetium in a sun like star  you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere  because in a natural way it is impossible to do this. Now we are reviewing the spectra of about     stars with extrasolar planets. And we are doing this job since      and it's a very heavy project. We have been working very hard. And we have some interesting cases  candidates  so on  things which we can't really explain. And I hope in the near future we can confirm this. So the main question   Are we alone   I think it will not come from UFOs. It will not come from radio signals. I think it will come from a spectrum like this. It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth  showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide  as a clear signal of life  and oxygen and ozone. If  one day  and I think it will be within    years from now  or    years. If we discover a spectrum like this we can be sure that there is life on that planet. In about five years we will discover planets like Earth  around sun like stars  the same distance as the Earth from the Sun. It will take about five years. And then we will need another        years with space projects to get the spectra of Earth like planets like the one I showed you. And if we see the nitrogen dioxide and oxygen  I think we have the perfect E.T. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Let's begin with a story. Once upon a time    well actually less than two years ago    in a kingdom not so very far away  there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown    an internationally famous company. Let's call it Island Networks. Now this kingdom had many resources and mighty ambitions  but the one thing it lacked was people. And so it invited workers from around the world to come and help it build the nation. But in order to enter and to stay these migrants had to pass a few tests. And so it was  our man presented himself to authorities in the kingdom  looking forward to settling into his new life. But then something unexpected happened. The medical personnel who took blood samples from the man never actually told him what they were testing for. He wasn't offered counseling before or after the test  which is best medical practice. He was never informed of the results of the test. And yet  a couple of weeks later  he was picked up and taken to prison where he was subjected to a medical exam  including a full body search in full view of the others in the cell. He was released  but then a day or two later  he was taken to the airport and he was deported. What on earth did this man do to merit this treatment  What was his terrible crime  He was infected with HIV. Now the kingdom is one of about    countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with HIV. The kingdom argues that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners who pose a risk to the economy or the security or the public health or the morals of the state. But these laws  when applied to people living with HIV  are a violation of international human rights agreements to which these countries are signatories. But you know what  Matters of principle aside  practically speaking  these laws drive HIV underground. People are less likely to come forth to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition  none of which helps these individuals or the communities these laws purport to protect. Today we can prevent the transmission of HIV. And with treatment  it is a manageable condition. We are very far from the days when the only practical response to dread disease was to have banished the afflicted    like this   The Exile of the Leper.  So you tell me why  in our age of science  we still have laws and policies which come from an age of superstition. Time for a quick show of hands. Who here has been touched by HIV    either because you yourself have the virus or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague who is living with HIV  Hands up. Wow. Wow. That's a significant number of us. You know better than anyone that HIV brings out the best and the worst in humanity. And the laws reflect these attitudes. I'm not just talking about laws on the books  but laws as they are enforced on the streets and laws as they are decided in the courts. And I'm not just talking about laws as they relate to people living with HIV  but people who are at greatest risk of infection    people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or men who have sex with men or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners. And in many parts of the world that includes women and children who are especially vulnerable. Now there are laws in many parts of the world which reflect the best of human nature. These laws treat people touched by HIV with compassion and acceptance. These laws respect universal human rights and they are grounded in evidence. These laws ensure that people living with HIV and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment. Unfortunately  these good laws are counter balanced by a mass of really bad law    law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation  laws which specifically punish people living with HIV or those at greatest risk. These laws fly in the face of science  and they are grounded in prejudice and in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition and a selective reading of religion. But you know what  You don't have to take my word for it. We're going to hear from two people who are on the sharp end of the law. The first is Nick Rhoades. He's an American. And he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law on HIV transmission and exposure    neither of which offense he actually committed. then that is telling society that is unacceptable  that's bad behavior. And I think the severity of that punishment tells you how bad you are as a person. You're a class B felon  lifetime sex offender. You are a very  very  very bad person. And you did a very  very  very bad thing. And so that's just programmed into you. And you go through the correctional system and everyone's telling you the same thing. And you're just like  I'm a very bad person. Shereen El Feki  It's not just a question of unfair or ineffective laws. Some countries have good laws  laws which could stem the tide of HIV. The problem is that these laws are flouted. Because stigma gives unofficial license to treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk unlike other citizens. And this is exactly what happened to Helma and Dongo from Namibia. when I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check up. The nurse announced that every pregnant woman must also be tested for HIV that day. I took the test and the result showed I was positive. That's the day I found out. The nurse said to me   Why should you people bcome pregnant when you know you are HIV positive  Why are you pregnant when you are living positive   I am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me. Because I am HIV positive. They didn't give the forms to me or explain what was in the form. The nurse just came with it already marked where I had to sign. And with the labor pain  I didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me. I just signed. SE  Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom are among the    million people living with HIV according to recent estimates. They're the lucky ones because they're still alive. According to those same estimates  in       .  million people died of AIDS related causes. These are terrible and tragic figures. But if we look a little more broadly into the statistics  we actually see some reason for hope. Looking globally  the number of new infections of HIV is declining. And looking globally as well  deaths are also starting to fall. There are many reasons for these positive developments  but one of the most remarkable is in the increase in the number of people around the world on anti retroviral therapy  the medicines they need to keep their HIV in check. Now there are still many problems. Only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it. In some parts of the world    like here in the Middle East and North Africa    new infections are rising and so are deaths. And the money  the money we need for the global response to HIV  that is shrinking. But for the first time in three decades into this epidemic we have a real chance to come to grips with HIV. But in order to do that we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law. It's for this reason that the Global Commission on HIV and the Law  of which I'm a member  was established by the agencies of the United Nations    to look at the ways that legal environments are affecting people living with HIV and those at greatest risk  and to recommend what should be done to make the law an ally  not an enemy  of the global response to HIV. Let me give you just one example of the way a legal environment can make a positive difference. People who inject drugs are one of those groups I mentioned. They're at high risk of HIV through contaminated injection equipment and other risk related behaviors. In fact  one in every    new infections of HIV is among people who inject drugs. Now drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country. But some countries take a harder line on this than others. In Thailand people who use drugs  or are merely suspected of using drugs  are placed in detention centers  like the one you see here  where they are supposed to clean up. There is absolutely no evidence to show that throwing people into detention cures their drug dependence. There is  however  ample evidence to show that incarcerating people increases their risk of HIV and other infections. We know how to reduce HIV transmission and other risks in people who inject drugs. It's called harm reduction  and it involves  among other things  providing clean needles and syringes  offering opioid substitution therapy and other evidence based treatments to reduce drug dependence. It involves providing information and education and condoms to reduce HIV transmission  and also providing HIV testing and counseling and treatment should people become infected. Where the legal environment allows for harm reduction the results are striking. Australia and Switzerland were two countries which introduced harm reduction very early on in their HIV epidemics  and they have a very low rate of HIV among injecting drug users. The U.S. and Malaysia came to harm reduction a little later  and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations. Thailand and Russia  however  have resisted harm reduction and have stringent laws which punish drug use. And hey  surprise  very high rates of HIV among people who are injecting drugs. At the Global Commission we have studied the evidence  and we've heard the experiences of over     people from     countries. And the trend  Well the trend is clear. Where you criminalize people living with HIV or those at greatest risk  you fuel the epidemic. Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV or a cure for AIDS    now that's rocket science. But changing the law isn't. And in fact  a number of countries are starting to make progress on a number of points. To begin  countries need to review their legislation as it touches HIV and vulnerable groups. On the back of those reviews  governments should repeal laws that punish or discriminate against people living with HIV or those at greatest risk. Repealing a law isn't easy  and it's particularly difficult when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex. But there's plenty you can do while that process is underway. One of the key points is to reform the police so that they have better practices on the ground. So for example  outreach workers who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations are not themselves subject to police harassment or abuse or arbitrary arrest. We can also train judges so that they find flexibilities in the law and so that they rule on the side of tolerance rather than prejudice. We can retool prisons so that HIV prevention and harm reduction is available to prisoners. The key to all this is reinforcing civil society. Because civil society is key to raising awareness among vulnerable groups of their legal rights. But awareness needs action. And so we need to ensure that these people who are living with HIV or at greatest risk of HIV have access to legal services and they have equal access to the courts. And also important is talking to communities so that we change interpretations of religious or customary law  which is too often used to justify punishment and fuel stigma. For many of us here HIV is not an abstract threat. It hits very close to home. The law  on the other hand  can seem remote  arcane  the stuff of specialists  but it isn't. Because for those of us who live in democracies  or in aspiring democracies  the law begins with us. Laws that treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk with respect start with the way that we treat them ourselves  as equals. If we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime  then that is the change we need to spread. Thank you.\n",
      "What do you do when you have a headache  You swallow an aspirin. But for this pill to get to your head  where the pain is  it goes through your stomach  intestines and various other organs first. Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering any medication in the body. The downside  though  is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution. And this is a big problem  particularly in HIV patients. When they take their anti HIV drugs  these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood  and increasing the CD  cell counts. But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects  but mostly bad  because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood  and worse  by the time they get to the sites where it matters most  within the HIV viral reservoirs. These areas in the body    such as the lymph nodes  the nervous system  as well as the lungs    where the virus is sleeping  and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti HIV drugs therapy. However  upon discontinuation of therapy  the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood. Now  all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment  which is a life long treatment that must be swallowed by patients. One day  I sat and thought   Can we deliver anti HIV directly within its reservoir sites  without the risk of drug dilution   As a laser scientist  the answer was just before my eyes  Lasers  of course. If they can be used for dentistry  for diabetic wound healing and surgery  they can be used for anything imaginable  including transporting drugs into cells. As a matter of fact  we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes  which open and close almost immediately in HIV infected cells  in order to deliver drugs within them.  How is that possible   you may ask. Well  we shine a very powerful but super tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV infected cells while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug. The laser pierces the cell  while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds. Before you even know it  the induced hole becomes immediately repaired. Now  we are currently testing this technology in test tubes or in Petri dishes  but the goal is to get this technology in the human body  apply it in the human body.  How is that possible   you may ask. Well  the answer is  through a three headed device. Using the first head  which is our laser  we will make an incision in the site of infection. Using the second head  which is a camera  we meander to the site of infection. Finally  using a third head  which is a drug spreading sprinkler  we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection  while the laser is again used to poke those cells open. Well  this might not seem like much right now. But one day  if successful  this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body. Yes. A cure for HIV. This is every HIV researcher's dream    in our case  a cure lead by lasers. Thank you.\n",
      "AIDS was discovered       the virus      . These Gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in      in the world  or how we estimate that it was. What we are showing here is    on this axis here  I'm showing percent of infected adults. And on this axis  I'm showing dollars per person in income. And the size of these bubbles  the size of the bubbles here  that shows how many are infected in each country  and the color is the continent. Now  you can see United States  in       had a very low percentage infected  but due to the big population  still a sizable bubble. There were quite many people infected in the United States. And  up there  you see Uganda. They had almost five percent infected  and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country  then. And they were probably the most infected country in the world. Now  what has happened  Now you have understood the graph and now  in the next    seconds  we will play the HIV epidemic in the world. But first  I have a new invention here. I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer. So  ready  steady  go  First  we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe. They went upwards like this. In Asia  the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand    they reached one to two percent. Then  Uganda started to turn back  whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed  and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency. Look  India got many infected  but had a low level. And almost the same happens here. See  Uganda coming down  Zimbabwe coming down  Russia went to one percent. In the last two to three years  we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.    years it took. But  steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better  it's just that they have stopped getting worse. And it has    the steady state is  more or less  one percent of the adult world population is HIV infected. It means    to    million people  the whole of California    every person  that's more or less what we have today in the world. Now  let me make a fast replay of Botswana. Botswana    upper middle income country in southern Africa  democratic government  good economy  and this is what happened there. They started low  they skyrocketed  they peaked up there in       and now they are down. But they are falling only slowly  because in Botswana  with good economy and governance  they can manage to treat people. And if people who are infected are treated  they don't die of AIDS. These percentages won't come down because people can survive    to    years. So there's some problem with these metrics now. But the poorer countries in Africa  the low income countries down here  there the rates fall faster  of the percentage infected  because people still die. In spite of PEPFAR  the generous PEPFAR  all people are not reached by treatment  and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries  only    percent are left on treatment after two years. It's not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries. But it's very good that what is done is being done. But focus now is back on prevention. It is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it. Drugs is too costly    had we had the vaccine  or when we will get the vaccine  that's something more effective    but the drugs are very costly for the poor. Not the drug in itself  but the treatment and the care which is needed around it. So  when we look at the pattern  one thing comes out very clearly  you see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa. I would say  HIV is very different in Africa. You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world in African countries  and yet you'll find Senegal  down here    the same rate as United States. And you'll find Madagascar  and you'll find a lot of African countries about as low as the rest of the world. It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa. We have to stop that. It's not respectful  and it's not very clever to think that way. I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States. I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different. And so it is in Africa    it's a lot of difference. So  why is it so high  Is it war  No  it's not. Look here. War torn Congo is down there    two  three  four percent. And this is peaceful Zambia  neighboring country       percent. And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo    they have two  three percent infected  and peaceful Zambia    much higher. There are now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible  that rapes are terrible  but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa. So  is it poverty  Well if you look at the macro level  it seems more money  more HIV. But that's very simplistic  so let's go down and look at Tanzania. I will split Tanzania in five income groups  from the highest income to the lowest income  and here we go. The ones with the highest income  the better off    I wouldn't say rich    they have higher HIV. The difference goes from    percent down to four percent  and it is even bigger among women. There's a lot of things that we thought  that now  good research  done by African institutions and researchers together with the international researchers  show that that's not the case. So  this is the difference within Tanzania. And  I can't avoid showing Kenya. Look here at Kenya. I've split Kenya in its provinces. Here it goes. See the difference within one African country    it goes from very low level to very high level  and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest. So  what is it then  Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries  Well  it is more common with multiple partners  there is less condom use  and there is age disparate sex    that is  older men tend to have sex with younger women. We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries. But where are they situated  I will swap the bubbles to a map. Look  the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold    percent of the HIV infected. HIV exists all over the world. Look  you have bubbles all over the world here. Brazil has many HIV infected. Arab countries not so much  but Iran is quite high. They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran. India has many because they are many. Southeast Asia  and so on. But  there is one part of Africa    and the difficult thing is  at the same time  not to make a uniform statement about Africa  not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this  on one hand. On the other hand  try to say that this is not the case  because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now. UNAIDS have done good data available  finally  about the spread of HIV. It could be concurrency. It could be some virus types. It could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency. After all  if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex  the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in      . Don't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on. But    and if you are in an unfavorable situation  more sexually transmitted diseases  it can be one in    . But what we think is that it could be concurrency. And what is concurrency  In Sweden  we have no concurrency. We have serial monogamy. Vodka  New Year's Eve    new partner for the spring. Vodka  Midsummer's Eve    new partner for the fall. Vodka    and it goes on like this  you know  And you collect a big number of exes. And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic    terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years. HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore  having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others. Probably  it's a combination of this. And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this. You can get this chart  free. We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site. And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart  we will not only have the money  but we will also use the brain. Thank you very much.\n",
      "I want you to take a trip with me. Picture yourself driving down a small road in Africa  and as you drive along  you look off to the side  and this is what you see  you see a field of graves. And you stop  and you get out of your car and you take a picture. And you go into the town  and you inquire   What's going on here   and people are initially reluctant to tell you. And then someone says   These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community.  HIV isn't like other medical conditions  it's stigmatizing. People are reluctant to talk about it    there's a fear associated with it. And I'm going to talk about HIV today  about the deaths  about the stigma. It's a medical story  but more than that  it's a social story. This map depicts the global distribution of HIV. And as you can see  Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection. There are    million people living with HIV in the world today. Of these  two thirds     million are living in sub Saharan Africa. There are  .  million pregnant women in low  and middle income countries living with HIV and of these     percent are in sub Saharan Africa. We talk about things in relative terms. And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and HIV positive mothers. The United States    a large country    each year        mothers with HIV who give birth to a child. But you go to Rwanda    a very small country          mothers with HIV who are pregnant. And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital  outside of Johannesburg in South Africa  and       HIV positive pregnant women giving birth    a hospital the same as a country. And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to South Africa  it just pales  because in South Africa  each year         mothers with HIV give birth to children. So we talk about PMTCT  and we refer to PMTCT  prevention of mother to child transmission. I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV positive  she's going to infect her child. The reality is really  very different. In resource rich countries  with all the tests and treatment we currently have  less than two percent of babies are born HIV positive       percent of babies are born HIV negative. And yet  the reality in resource poor countries  in the absence of tests and treatment     percent       percent of children are infected       percent versus two percent    an enormous difference. So these programs    and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk    these prevention programs  simply  they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies  and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children. So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in. It's the drugs she receives to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery. It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex. It's an entire package of services  and it works. So in the United States  since the advent of treatment in the middle of the     s  there's been an    percent decline in the number of HIV infected children. Less than     babies are born with HIV each year in the United States and yet  still  over         children are born every year in the world today with HIV. What does that mean  It means       children infected each day          children each day  infected with HIV. And where do they come from  Well  less than one comes from the United States. One  on average  comes from Europe.     come from Asia and the Pacific. And each day  a thousand babies    a thousand babies are born each day with HIV in Africa. So again  I look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa. And let's look at another map. And here  again  we see Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors. That thin sliver you see here  that's Africa. And it's the same with nurses. The truth is sub Saharan Africa has    percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers. That means doctors and nurses simply don't have the time to take care of patients. A nurse in a busy clinic will see    to     patients in a day  which leaves her just minutes per patient    minutes per patient. And so when we look at these PMTCT programs  what does it mean  Well  back in       when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug  a nurse  in the course of her few minutes with a patient  would have to counsel for the HIV test  perform the HIV test  explain the results  dispense a single dose of the drug  Nevirapine  explain how to take it  discuss infant feeding options  reinforce infant feeding  and test the baby    in minutes. Well  fortunately since       we've got new treatments  new tests  and we're far more successful  but we don't have any more nurses. And so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes. It's not possible    it doesn't work. And so we need to find better ways of providing care. This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa    mothers coming  pregnant and with their babies. These women are here for care  but we know that just doing a test  just giving someone a drug  it's not enough. Meds don't equal medical care. Doctors and nurses  frankly  don't have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand. I'm a doctor    I tell people things to do  and I expect them to follow my guidance    because I'm a doctor  I went to Harvard    but the reality is  if I tell a patient   You should have safer sex. You should always use a condom   and yet  in her relationship  she's not empowered    what's going to happen  If I tell her to take her medicines every day and yet  no one in the household knows about her illness  so it's just not going to work. And so we need to do more  we need to do it differently  we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale  which means it can be done everywhere. So  I want to tell you a story    I want to take you on a little trip. Imagine yourself  if you can  you're a young woman in Africa  you're going to the hospital or clinic. You go in for a test and you find out that you're pregnant  and you're delighted. And then they give you another test and they tell you you're HIV positive  and you're devastated. And the nurse takes you into a room  and she tells you about the tests and HIV and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby  and you hear none of it. All you're hearing is   I'm going to die  and my baby is going to die.  And then you're out on the street  and you don't know where to go. And you don't know who you can talk to  because the truth is  HIV is so stigmatizing that if you partner  your family  anyone in your home  you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support. And this    this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today. But we're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news. And I want to change the story a little bit. Take the same mother  and the nurse  after she gives her her test  takes her to a room. The door opens and there's a room full of mothers  mothers with babies  and they're sitting  and they're talking  they're listening. They're drinking tea  they're having sandwiches. And she goes inside  and woman comes up to her and says   Welcome to mothers mothers. Have a seat. You're safe here. We're all HIV positive. You're going to be okay. You're going to live. Your baby is going to be HIV negative.  We view mothers as a community's single greatest resource. Mothers take care of the children  take care of the home. So often the men are gone. They're working  or they're not part of the household. Our organization  mothers mothers  enlists women with HIV as care providers. We bring mothers who have HIV  who've been through these PMTCT programs in the very facilities  to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team. These mothers  we call them mentor mothers  are able to engage women who  just like themselves  pregnant with babies  have found out about being HIV positive  who need support and education. And they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines  how to take care of themselves  how to take care of their babies. Consider  if you needed surgery  you would want the best possible technical surgeon  right  But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life  you'd like to engage someone  someone who's had the procedure. Patients are experts on their own experience  and they can share that experience with others. This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines. So the mothers who work for us  they come from the communities in which they work. They're hired    they're paid as professional members of the health care teams  just like doctors and nurses. And we open bank accounts for them and they're paid directly into the accounts  because their money's protected  the men can't take it away from them. They go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum based education  training. Now  doctors and nurses    they too get trained. But so often  they only get trained once  so they're not aware of new medicines  new guidelines as they come out. Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained. And so doctors and nurses    they look up to them as experts. Imagine that  a woman  a former patient  being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that she's taking care of. Our organization has three goals. The first  to prevent mother to child transmission. The second  keep mothers healthy  keep mothers alive  keep the children alive    no more orphans. And the third  and maybe the most grand  is to find ways to empower women  enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with HIV. So how do we do it  Well  maybe the most important engagement is the one to one  seeing patients one to one  educating them  supporting them  explaining how they can take care of themselves. We go beyond that  we try to bring in the husbands  the partners. In Africa  it's very  very hard to engage men. Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care. But in Rwanda  in one country  they've got a policy that a woman can't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her    that's the rule. And so the father and the mother  together  go through the counseling and the testing. The father and the mother  together  they get the results. And this is so important in breaking through the stigma. Disclosure is so central to prevention. How do you have safer sex  how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn't been disclosure  Disclosure is so important to treatment  because again  people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly. We also work in groups. Now the groups  it's not like me lecturing  but what happens is women  they come together    under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers    they come together  and they share their personal experiences. And it's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves  how to disclose how to take medicines. And then there's the community outreach  engaging women in their communities. If we can change the way households believe and think  we can change the way communities believe and think. And if we can change enough communities  we can change national attitudes. We can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to HIV. The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction. We have the medicines  we have the tests  but how do you reduce the stigma  And it's important about disclosure. So  a couple years ago  one of the mentor mothers came back  and she told me a story. She had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client  because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her HIV status  and she was afraid to go by herself. And so the mentor mother went along with. And the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings   I have something to tell you. I'm HIV positive.  And everybody was quiet. And then her oldest brother stood up and said   I too have something to tell you. I'm HIV positive. I've been afraid to tell everybody.  And then this older sister stood up and said   I too am living with the virus  and I've been ashamed.  And then her younger brother stood up and said   I'm also positive. I thought you were going to throw me out of the family.  And you see where this is going. The last sister stood up and said   I'm also positive. I thought you were going to hate me.  And there they were  all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time. and they are crying and scared. I tell them my story  that I am HIV positive  but my child is HIV negative. I tell them   You are going to make it  and you will raise a healthy baby.  I am proof that there is hope. Mitchell Besser  Remember the images I showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa. And it is a crisis in health care systems. Even as we have more tests and more drugs  we can't reach people  we don't have enough providers. So we talk in terms of what we call task shifting. Task shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it. Typically  it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse. And the issue in Africa is that there are fewer nurses  really than doctors  and so we need to find new paradigm for health care. How do you build a better health care system  We've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor  a nurse and a mentor mother. And so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs  the side effects. They delegate education about infant feeding  family planning  safer sex  actions that nurses simple just don't have time for. So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission. The world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health. And our organization helps women across that bridge. The care doesn't stop when the baby's born    we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby  ensuring that they live healthy  successful lives. Our organization works on three levels. The first  at the patient level    mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV  keeping mothers healthy to raise them. The second  communities    empowering women. They become leaders within their communities. They change the way communities think    we need to change attitudes to HIV. We need to change attitudes to women in Africa. We have to do that. And then rework the level of the health care systems  building stronger health care systems. Our health care systems are broken. They're not going to work the way they're currently designed. And so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people's behaviors don't have the skills  don't have the time    our mentor mothers do. And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in  we can do that. I started the program in Capetown  South Africa back in     . It was at that point  just the spark of an idea. Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from  I was in the shower at the time    I was alone. The program is now working in nine countries  we have     program sites  we're seeing about         women every month  we're employing       mentor mothers  and last year  they enrolled         HIV positive pregnant women and mothers. That is    percent of the global HIV positive pregnant women       percent of the world. What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is. Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV. Past patients taking care of present patients. And empowerment through employment    reducing stigma. hope that one day we shall win this fight against HIV and AIDS. Each person must know their HIV status. Those who are HIV negative must know how to stay negative. Those who are HIV infected must know how to take care of themselves. HIV positive pregnant women must get PMTCT services in order to have HIV negative babies. All of this is possible  if we each contribute to this fight. MB  Simple solutions to complex problems. Mothers caring for mothers. It's transformational. Thank you.\n",
      "Do you worry about what is going to kill you  Heart disease  cancer  a car accident  Most of us worry about things we can't control  like war  terrorism  the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti. But what really threatens humanity  A few years ago  Professor Vaclav Smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history. He called these   massively fatal discontinuities   meaning that they could kill up to     million people in the next    years. He looked at the odds of another world war  of a massive volcanic eruption  even of an asteroid hitting the Earth. But he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to     percent  and that is a severe flu pandemic. Now  you might think of flu as just a really bad cold  but it can be a death sentence. Every year         people in the United States die of seasonal flu. In the developing world  the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher. You know  the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically  it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic. In       a new virus appeared that killed some    to     million people. It spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms. Are we safer today  Well  we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared  but this threat could reappear at any time. The good news is that we're at a moment in time when science  technology  globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility  the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one fifth of all deaths and countless misery on Earth. We can do this. We're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines  and if we get these to more people  we can certainly save more lives. But with new or better vaccines for malaria  TB  HIV  pneumonia  diarrhea  flu  we could end suffering that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time. So  I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you. But first  I have to explain why they're important because vaccines  the power of them  is really like a whisper. When they work  they can make history  but after a while you can barely hear them. Now  some of us are old enough to have a small  circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children. But when was the last time you worried about smallpox  a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us  Or polio  How many of you remember the iron lung  We don't see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines. Now  it's interesting because there are    odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now  but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu. Why is that  Well  here's the dirty little secret. Until recently  we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked. We knew they worked through old fashioned trial and error. You took a pathogen  you modified it  you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened. This worked well for most pathogens  somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu  but not at all for HIV  for which humans have no natural immunity. So let's explore how vaccines work. They basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed. Now  when you get a viral infection  what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength  and that might be too late. When you're pre immunized  what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes. So that's really how vaccines work. Now  let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at TED  for the first time  on how an effective HIV vaccine might work. Narrator  A vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader. After HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers  it infects immune cells to replicate. The invader draws the attention of the immune system's front line troops. Dendritic cells  or macrophages  capture the virus and display pieces of it. Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the front line troops. These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed. Memory B cells turn into plasma cells  which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto HIV to prevent it from infecting cells  while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected. The virus is defeated. Without a vaccine  these responses would have taken more than a week. By that time  the battle against HIV would already have been lost. Seth Berkley  Really cool video  isn't it  The antibodies you just saw in this video  in action  are the ones that make most vaccines work. So the real question then is  How do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV  The principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing. So let's take a look at the flu virus. In this rendering of the flu virus  these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you. And also  what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus. When these mutate  they change their shape  and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore. So that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu. It's also why in the spring  we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year  put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall. Even worse  the most common influenza    influenza A    also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans  and they can recombine in those particular animals. In addition  wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza. So  you've got this situation  In       we had an H N  virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of    percent. Now luckily  that particular virus  although very scary at the time  did not transmit from person to person very easily. This year's H N  threat was actually a human  avian  swine mixture that arose in Mexico. It was easily transmitted  but  luckily  was pretty mild. And so  in a sense  our luck is holding out  but you know  another wild bird could fly over at anytime. Now let's take a look at HIV. As variable as flu is  HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibraltar. The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted. It mutates furiously  it has decoys to evade the immune system  it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome. Here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV  a much wilder target. In the video a moment ago  you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells. Now realize that in a recently infected person  there are millions of these ships  each one is just slightly different. Finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder. Now  in the    years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS  we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together. These drugs aren't cures  but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV  at least for those who can access them. The vaccine effort though is really quite different. Large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business. Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine  but today  evidence tells us otherwise. In September  we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand. For the first time  we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans    albeit  quite modestly    and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago. Newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models. But in the past few months  researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an HIV infected individual. Now  what does this mean  We saw earlier that HIV is highly variable  that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus. If you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models  they provide full protection from infection. In addition  these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto  and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates. It's like  as many times as the virus changes its clothes  it's still wearing the same socks  and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks. So what we've got is a situation. The Thai results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine  and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that. This strategy  working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate  has never been done before in vaccine research. It's called retro vaccinology  and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV. So think of it this way. We've got these new antibodies we've identified  and we know that they latch onto many  many variations of the virus. We know that they have to latch onto a specific part  so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part  present that through a vaccine  what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies. And that would create a universal HIV vaccine. Now  it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site  and as you can imagine  these three dimensional structures are much harder to work on. And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this  we'd love to hear about it. But  you know  the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases. So for instance  a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza  as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus. They're currently making a cocktail    an antibody cocktail    that can be used to treat severe  overwhelming cases of flu. In the longer term  what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine. Now  retro vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so called rational vaccine design. Let me give you another example. We talked about before the H and N spikes on the surface of the flu virus. Notice these other  smaller protuberances. These are largely hidden from the immune system. Now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates. If you can cripple these with specific antibodies  you could cripple all versions of the flu. So far  animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease  although you might get a mild case. So if this works in humans  what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine  one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death. We really could think of flu  then  as just a bad cold. Of course  the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it. So to do that  we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and  of course  smart delivery methods. So I want you to think back a few months ago. In June  the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in    years. The U.S. government promised     million doses of vaccine by October   th for the flu peak. Vaccines were promised to developing countries. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing. So what happened  Well  we first figured out how to make flu vaccines  how to produce them  in the early     s. It was a slow  cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs  millions of living chicken eggs. Viruses only grow in living things  and so it turned out that  for flu  chicken eggs worked really well. For most strains  you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg. Luckily for us  we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances. So today  we get our flu vaccines from ... chicken eggs  hundreds of millions of chicken eggs. Almost nothing has changed. The system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow. This year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production  basically .  doses per egg. So  here's an alarming thought. What if that wild bird flies by again  You could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks  and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines. So  Dan  Barber   if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm  I know where to get them. So right now  the world can produce about     million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains  and we can up that to about  .  billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu. But this assumes that our factories are humming because  in       the U.S. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant. And the process still takes more than half a year. So are we better prepared than we were in       Well  with the new technologies emerging now  I hope we can say definitively   Yes.  Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States. With a range of new technologies  we could. Here's an example  A company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system. If you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium  which creates a vigorous immune response  they've created a very powerful flu fighter. This vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria  E. coli. Now  as you know  bacteria reproduce quickly    it's like making yogurt    and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories  in a few weeks  with no eggs  for a fraction of the cost of current methods. So here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies. And  aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings    for example  the E. coli method I just talked about    look at the time saved  this would be lives saved. The developing world  mostly left out of the current response  sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they're leapfrogging the West. India  Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines  and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use. Because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap  billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them. Now think of where this leads us. New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years. Some day  perhaps soon  we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us. Will we be quick enough to react before millions die  Luckily  this year's flu was relatively mild. I say   luckily  in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated. So if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments  we will master these and new tools of vaccinology  and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives. No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year. No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year. No longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases  or indeed  anybody. Instead of having Vaclav Smil's  massively fatal discontinuity  of life  we can ensure the continuity of life. What the world needs now are these new vaccines  and we can make it happen. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you. So  the science is changing. In your mind  Seth    I mean  you must dream about this    what is the kind of time scale on  let's start with HIV  for a game changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable  SB  The game change can come at any time  because the problem we have now is we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans  we just need a better one. And with these types of antibodies  we know humans can make them. So  if we can figure out how to do that  then we have the vaccine  and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem. So  the challenge is full speed ahead. CA  In your gut  do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years  SB  You know  everybody says it's    years  but it's been    years every    years. So I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation  but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends. CA  And that's the same with universal flu vaccine  the same kind of thing  SB  I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch    I just showed some of this    a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now. They look good. The problem has been that  what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that's what we were comfortable with. You also can use adjuvants  which are chemicals you mix. That's what Europe is doing  so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available  but  going back to what Michael Specter said  the anti vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen. CA  And malaria's even further behind  SB  No  malaria  there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now. It probably isn't the perfect vaccine  but it's moving along. CA  Seth  most of us do work where every month  we produce something  we get that kind of gratification. You've been slaving away at this for more than a decade  and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do. The world needs people like you. Thank you. SB  Thank you.\n",

      "I was sitting with my girls  and Joy said   Dang  I wish he'd get off my back. My daddy  he calls me all the time.   Lucky for you he calls at all   said Jasmine.  I haven't heard from my dad in years.  At this moment  I knew the girls needed a way to connect with their fathers. At Camp Diva  my non profit organization  we have these types of conversations all the time as a way to help girls of African descent prepare for their passage into womanhood. These girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms. So I asked the girls   How can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers    Let's have a dance   one girl shouted  and all the girls quickly backed her up. They started dreaming about the decorations  invitations  the dresses they were going to wear  and what their fathers could and could not wear.  Laughter  It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes  but even if I could have slowed down those girls  I wouldn't have  because one thing that I have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need. The wisdom lives inside of them. As long as they have infrastructure  mentorship and resources  they can build what they need  not only to survive  but to thrive. So we had a dance  and girls and their fathers came in multitudes. They were dressed to the nines. They acted sweet. They acted silly. They really enjoyed each other's company. It was a huge success. And the girls decided to make it an annual event. So as the seasons changed  and it was time to plan the dance again  one girl named Brianna spoke up  and she said   My dad can't come to the dance  and this whole thing is making me sad.   Why not   the girls asked.  Because he's in jail   she bravely admitted.  Well  can he just get out for a day   one of the girls asked.  Laughter   And come in shackles  That's worse than not having him here at all.  At this moment  I saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes. So I asked   What do you think we should do about this  We want every girl to experience the dance  right   So the girls thought for a moment  and one girl suggested   Why don't we just take the dance in the jail   Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that  and said   Are you crazy  Who is going to allow a bunch of little girls  dressed up      Laughter      to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits   Because that's what they called them. I said   Girls  well  well  you never know unless you ask.  So a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff  signed collectively by each girl  and I would have to say  he is a very special sheriff. He contacted me immediately and said  whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside  his doors are always open. Because one thing he did know  that when fathers are connected to their children  it is less likely that they will return. So     inmates and    girls were invited. The girls were dressed in their Sunday best  and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties. They hugged. They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish. They laughed together. It was beautiful. The fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection  something that a lot of them didn't even have for a while. Fathers were in a space where they were able to make their daughters play  and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance. Even the guards cried. But after the dance  we all realized that Dad still would be in jail. So we needed to create something that they could take with them. So we brought in Flip cams  and we had them look at the Flip cams and just interview each other    their messages  their thoughts. This was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected  they could reconnect through this image. I'll never forget that one girl looked in her father's eyes with that camera and said   Daddy  when you look at me  what do you see   Because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve  and how they see us for the rest of our lives. I know that very well  because I was one of the lucky girls. I have had my father in my life always. He's even here today. And that is why it is extremely special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers  especially those who are separated because of barbed wires and metal doors. We have just created a form for girls who have heavy questions on their heart to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions and given the fathers the freedom to answer. Because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought  What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world  Because a father is locked in does not mean he should be locked out of his daughter's life.\n",
      "Namaste. Good morning. I'm very happy to be here in India. And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly    years with V Day and  The Vagina Monologues   traveling the world  essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women. What I want to talk about today is this particular cell  or grouping of cells  that is in each and every one of us. And I want to call it the girl cell. And it's in men as well as in women. I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race. And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell  the oppression of these cells  the reinterpretation of these cells  the undermining of these cells  getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing  eradicating  destroying  reducing these cells  basically began the process of killing off the girl cell  which was  by the way  patriarchy. I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness. And it is essential to balance  to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us. And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion  and it's empathy  and it's passion itself  and it's vulnerability  and it's openness  and it's intensity  and it's association  and it's relationship  and it is intuitive. And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom  and that vulnerability is our greatest strength  and that emotions have inherent logic  which lead to radical  appropriate  saving action. And then let's remember that we've been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be  that compassion clouds your thinking  that it gets in the way  that vulnerability is weakness  that emotions are not to be trusted  and you're not supposed to take things personally  which is one of my favorites. I think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl. How do we bring up boys  What does it mean to be a boy  To be a boy really means not to be a girl. To be a man means not to be a girl. To be a woman means not to be a girl. To be strong means not to be a girl. To be a leader means not to be a girl. I actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we've had to train everyone not to be that. And I'd also like to say that the irony of course  is that denying girl  suppressing girl  suppressing emotion  refusing feeling has lead thus here. Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence  the most horrific poverty  genocide  mass rapes  the destruction of the Earth  is completely out of control. And because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our girl ship  we do not feel what is going on. So  we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening. I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo. For me  it was the turning point of my life. I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years. I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world  a lot of violence. I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last    years. But the Democratic Republic of Congo really was the turning point in my soul. I went and I spent time in a place called Bukavu in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital  with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met. His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege. In the Congo  for those of you who don't know  there has been a war raging for the last    years  a war that has killed nearly six million people. It is estimated that somewhere between         and         women have been raped there. When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital I sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories. Their stories were so horrific  and so mind blowing and so on the other side of human existence  that to be perfectly honest with you  I was shattered. And I will tell you that what happened is through that shattering  listening to the stories of eight year old girls who had their insides eviscerated  who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes  literally  inside them where their pee and poop came out of them. Listening to the story of    year old women who were tied to chains and circled  and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically  all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them. My mind was so shattered. But what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way I have never been emboldened. That shattering  that opening of my girl cell  that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous  and braver  and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life. I want to say that I think the powers that be know that empire building is actually    that feelings get in the way of empire building. Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth  and excavating the Earth  and destroying things. I remember  for example  when my father  who was very  very violent  used to beat me. And he would actually say  while he was beating me   Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry.  Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him. And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded of what he was doing. I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell. And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women. And I think in some ways we've been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell. I see how boys have been brought up  and I see this across the planet  to be tough  to be hardened  to distance themselves from their tenderness  to not cry. I actually realized once in Kosovo  when I watched a man break down  that bullets are actually hardened tears  that when we don't allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability  and have their compassion  and have their hearts  that they become hardened and hurtful and violent. And I think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure  to pretend they know things when they don't know things  or why would we be where we are  To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess. And I will tell you a very funny story. On my way here on the airplane  I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane. And all these men  literally at least    men  were in their little seats watching chick flicks. And they were all alone  and I thought   This is the secret life of men.  I've traveled  as I said  to many  many countries  and I've seen  if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it's horrific to think what we do to girls in the world. And we heard from Sunitha yesterday  and Kavita about what we do to girls. But I just want to say that I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns  who are literally being treated like ashtrays. I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans. I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles. I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves. I've seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate  or we make them feel bad about being too smart. We silence them. We make them feel guilty for being smart. We get them to behave  to tone it down  not to be too intense. We sell them  we kill them as embryos  we enslave them  we rape them. We are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities. The selling of girls is rampant across the planet. And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows. But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of    to     they are they key  really  in the developing world  as well as in the whole world  to the future of humanity. And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be  including lack of access to healthcare  education  healthy foods  labor force participation. The burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings  which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers. The state of girls  the condition of girls  will  in my belief    and that's the girl inside us and the girl in the world    determine whether the species survives. And what I want to suggest is that  having talked to girls  because I just finished a new book called  I Am an Emotional Creature  The Secret Life of Girls Around the World   I've been talking to girls for five years  and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that's been enforced on girl is the verb  to please.  Girls are trained to please. I want to change the verb. I want us all to change the verb. I want the verb to be  educate   or  activate   or  engage   or  confront   or  defy   or  create.  If we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them. And I have to now share a few stories of girls I've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl  who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them. I know a    year old girl in the Netherlands  for example  who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself. There is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed    stars tattooed on the right side of her face. There is a girl  Julia Butterfly Hill  who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks. There is a girl who I met    years ago in Afghanistan who I have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary. And this girl  when she was    years old  wore a burqa in Afghanistan  and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women  underneath her burqa  with a video. And that video became the video that went out all over the world after      to show what was going on in Afghanistan. I want to talk about Rachel Corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank to say   End the occupation.  And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank. And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently in Bukavu  who was impregnated by her rapist. And she was holding her baby. And I asked her if she loved her baby. And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said   Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby  It's my baby and it's full of love.  The capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels  to me  is mind blowing. There is a girl named Dorcas  and I just met her in Kenya. Dorcas is    years old  and she was trained in self defense. A few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men. They kidnapped her  they put her in a car. And through her self defense  she grabbed their Adam's apples  she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car. In Kenya  in August  I went to visit one of the V Day safe houses for girls  a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio. Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl  she was female genitally mutilated. And she made a decision as many women do across this planet  that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls. So  for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley. She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like  and what a mutilated vagina looked like. And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her we asked her what we could do for her  and she said   Well  if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster.  So  we got her a Jeep. And then she saved       girls. And then we asked her   Okay  what else do you need   And she said   Well  now  I need a house.  So  seven years ago Agnes built the first V Day safe house in Narok  Kenya  in the Masai land. And it was a house where girls could run away  they could save their clitoris  they wouldn't be cut  they could go to school. And in the years that Agnes has had the house  she has changed the situation there. She has literally become deputy mayor. She's changed the rules. The whole community has bought in to what she's doing. When we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls  who have run away  with their families. And there was a young girl named Jaclyn. Jaclyn was    years old and she was in her Masai family and there's a drought in Kenya. So cows are dying  and cows are the most valued possession. And Jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows. And she knew that meant she would be cut. She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school. She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future. She knew she would have to marry that old man  and she was   . So  one afternoon  she'd heard about the safe house  Jaclyn left her father's house and she walked for two days  two days through Masai land. She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night. She imagined her father killing her on one hand  and Mama Agnes greeting her  with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house. And when she got to the house she was greeted. Agnes took her in  and Agnes loved her  and Agnes supported her for the year. She went to school and she found her voice  and she found her identity  and she found her heart. Then  her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation  after a year. I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled. In that hut  we walked in  and her father and his four wives were sitting there  and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled  and her primary mother  who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders. When her father saw her and saw who she had become  in her full girl self  he threw his arms around her and broke down crying. He said   You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman. We will not cut you. And I give you my word  here and now  that we will not cut your sisters either.  And what she said to him was   You were willing to sell me for four cows  and a calf and some blankets. But I promise you  now that I will be educated I will always take care of you  and I will come back and I will build you a house. And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life.  For me  that is the power of girls. And that is the power of transformation. I want to close today with a new piece from my book. And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here. And I want to do it for Sunitha. And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday  the girls who survive  the girls who can become somebody else. But I really want to do it for each and every person here  to value the girl in us  to value the part that cries  to value the part that's emotional  to value the part that's vulnerable  to understand that's where the future lies. This is called  I'm An Emotional Creature.  And it happened because I met a girl in Watts  L.A. I was asking girls if they like being a girl  and all the girls were like   No  I hate it. I can't stand it. It's all bad. My brothers get everything.  And this girl just sat up and went   I love being a girl. I'm an emotional creature   This is for her  I love being a girl. I can feel what you're feeling as you're feeling inside the feeling before. I am an emotional creature. Things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard pressed ideas. They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears. Oh  I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off  even though she appears to give you what you want. I know when a storm is coming. I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air. I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share. I am an emotional creature. I love that I do not take things lightly. Everything is intense to me  the way I walk in the street  the way my momma wakes me up  the way it's unbearable when I lose  the way I hear bad news. I am an emotional creature. I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that. Don't you say all negative that it's only only a teenage thing  or it's only because I'm a girl. These feelings make me better. They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong. I am an emotional creature. There is a particular way of knowing. It's like the older women somehow forgot. I rejoice that it's still in my body. Oh  I know when the coconut's about to fall. I know we have pushed the Earth too far. I know my father isn't coming back  and that no one's prepared for the fire. I know that lipstick means more than show  and boys are super insecure  and so called terrorists are made  not born. I know that one kiss could take away all my decision making ability. And you know what  Sometimes it should. This is not extreme. It's a girl thing  what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open. Don't tell me not to cry  to calm it down  not to be so extreme  to be reasonable. I am an emotional creature. It's how the earth got made  how the wind continues to pollinate. You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave. I am an emotional creature. Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off  I am your remaining memory. I can take you back. Nothing's been diluted. Nothing's leaked out. I love  hear me  I love that I can feel the feelings inside you  even if they stop my life  even if they break my heart  even if they take me off track  they make me responsible.

      "Periods. Blood. Menstruation. Gross. Secret. Hidden. Why  A natural biological process that every girl and woman goes through every month for about half of her life. A phenomenon that is so significant that the survival and propagation of our species depends on it. Yet we consider it a taboo. We feel awkward and shameful talking about it. When I got my first periods  I was told to keep it a secret from others    even from my father and brother. Later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks  our biology teacher skipped the subject. You know what I learned from it  I learned that it is really shameful to talk about it. I learned to be ashamed of my body. I learned to stay unaware of periods in order to stay decent. Research in various parts of India shows that three out of every    girls are not aware of menstruation at the time of their first periods. And in some parts of Rajasthan this number is as high as nine out of    girls being unaware of it. You'd be surprised to know that most of the girls that I have spoken to  who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer and they're going to die soon. Menstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor for reproductive tract infections. But in India  only    percent of girls and women have access to hygienic ways of managing their periods. If you do the math     percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods. I was one of them. I grew up in a small town called Garhwa  in Jharkhand  where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful. So when I started getting my periods  I began with using rags. After every use I would wash and reuse them. But to store them  I would hide and keep it in a dark  damp place so that nobody finds out that I'm menstruating. Due to repeated washing the rags would become coarse  and I would often get rashes and infections using them. I wore these already for five years until I moved out of that town. Another issue that periods brought in my life those of the social restrictions that are imposed upon our girls and women when they're on their periods. I think you all must be aware of it  but I'll still list it for the few who don't. I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles. I was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member's bed. I had to wash my bed sheet after every period  even if it was not stained. I was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious importance. You'll find signposts outside temples denying the entry of menstruating girls and women. Ironically  most of the time it is the older woman who imposes such restrictions on younger girls in a family. After all  they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms. And in the absence of any intervention  it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation. During my years of work in this field  I have even come across stories where girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately. They're not allowed to take baths during periods  and in some households they are even secluded from other family members. About    percent of girls and women in India would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods every month. Can you imagine what this does to the self esteem and self confidence of a young girl  The psychological trauma that this inflicts  affecting her personality  her academic performance and every single aspect of growing up during her early formative years  I religiously followed all these restrictive customs for    years  until a discussion with my partner  Tuhin  changed my perception about menstruation forever. In       Tuhin and I were pursuing our postgraduation in design. We fell in love with each other and I was at ease discussing periods with him. Tuhin knew little about periods. He was astonished to know that girls get painful cramps and we bleed every month. Yeah. He was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls and women by their own families and their society. In order to help me with my cramps  he would go on the Internet and learn more about menstruation. When he shared his findings with me  I realized how little I knew about menstruation myself. And many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths. That's when we wondered  if we  being so well educated  were so ill informed about menstruation  there would be millions of girls out there who would be ill informed  too. To study    to understand the problem better  I undertook a year long research to study the lack of awareness about menstruation and the root cause behind it. While it is generally believed that menstrual unawareness and misconception is a rural phenomenon  during my research  I found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well. And it exists with the educated urban class  also. While talking to many parents and teachers  I found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about periods before they have started getting their menstrual cycle. And    but they lacked the proper means themselves. And since it is a taboo  they feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it. Girls nowadays get their periods in classes six and seven  but our educational curriculum teaches girls about periods only in standard eight and nine. And since it is a taboo  teachers still skip the subject altogether. So school does not teach girls about periods  parents don't talk about it. Where do the girls go  Two decades ago and now    nothing has changed. I shared these finding with Tuhin and we wondered  What if we could create something that would help girls understand about menstruation on their own    something that would help parents and teachers talk about periods comfortably to young girls  During my research  I was collecting a lot of stories. These were stories of experiences of girls during their periods. These stories would make girls curious and interested in talking about menstruation in their close circle. That's what we wanted. We wanted something that would make the girls curious and drive them to learn about it. We wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods. So we decided to create a comic book  where the cartoon characters would enact these stories and educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way. To represent girls in their different phases of puberty  we have three characters. Pinki  who has not gotten her period yet  Jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book and Mira who has already been getting her period. There is a fourth character  Priya Didi. Through her  girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up and menstrual hygiene management. While making the book  we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive. During our prototype testing  we found that the girls loved the book. They were keen on reading it and knowing more and more about periods on their own. Parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book  and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it. The comic book helped in creating an environment where menstruation ceased to be a taboo. Many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in India. And one of the volunteers took this prototype to educate young monks and took it to this monastery in Ladakh. We made the final version of the book  called  Menstrupedia Comic  and launched in September last year. And so far  more than       girls have been educated by using the book in India and    Thank you. And    different countries. We are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with local organizations to make this book available in different countries.    schools in different parts of India have made this book a part of their school curriculum to teach girls about menstruation. I am amazed to see how volunteers  individuals  parents  teachers  school principals  have come together and taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities  have made sure that the girls learn about periods at the right age and helped in breaking this taboo. I dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse  not a disease  but a welcoming change in a girl's life. And I would    And I would like to end this with a small request to all the parents here. Dear parents  if you would be ashamed of periods  your daughters would be  too. So please be period positive. Thank you.\n",
      "I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi  Eileen Piri. Eileen is only    years old  but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we wrote  I found her poem so interesting  so motivating. So I'll read it to you. She entitled her poem  I'll Marry When I Want.   I'll marry when I want. My mother can't force me to marry. My father cannot force me to marry. My uncle  my aunt  my brother or sister  cannot force me to marry. No one in the world can force me to marry. I'll marry when I want. Even if you beat me  even if you chase me away  even if you do anything bad to me  I'll marry when I want. I'll marry when I want  but not before I am well educated  and not before I am all grown up. I'll marry when I want.  This poem might seem odd  written by a    year old girl  but where I and Eileen come from  this poem  which I have just read to you  is a warrior's cry. I am from Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries  very poor  where gender equality is questionable. Growing up in that country  I couldn't make my own choices in life. I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two different girls  two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were eating the same food. Sometimes  they would share clothes  and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently  in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only    years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her  even me. I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture  once you reach puberty stage  you are supposed to go to initiation camps. In these initiation camps  you are taught how to sexually please a man. There is this special day  which they call  Very Special Day  where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For my little sister  she ended up being pregnant. Today  she's only    years old and she has three children. Her first marriage did not survive  nor did her second marriage. On the other side  there is this girl. She's amazing. I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me.  Laughter  When I was    years old  I was told  you are grown up  you have now reached of age  you're supposed to go to the initiation camp. I was like   What  I'm not going to go to the initiation camps.  You know what the women said to me   You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. You do not respect the traditions of our society  of our community.  I said no because I knew where I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. I wanted to get well educated  to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining myself as a lawyer  seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day  I would contribute something  a little something to my community. But every day after refusing  women would tell me   Look at you  you're all grown up. Your little sister has a baby. What about you   That was the music that I was hearing every day  and that is the music that girls hear every day when they don't do something that the community needs them to do. When I compared the two stories between me and my sister  I said   Why can't I do something  Why can't I change something that has happened for a long time in our community   That was when I called other girls just like my sister  who have children  who have been in class but they have forgotten how to read and write. I said   Come on  we can  remind each other how to read and write again  how to hold the pen  how to read  to hold the book.  It was a great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them  but they were able to tell me their personal stories  what they were facing every day as young mothers. That was when I was like  'Why can't we take all these things that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers  our traditional leaders  that these are the wrong things   It was a scary thing to do  because these traditional leaders  they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change  but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard  but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community  it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader  and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be married before the age of   . In my community  that was the first time a community  they had to call the bylaws  the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls not just in my community  but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill was being presented in February  we were there at the Parliament house. Every day  when the members of Parliament were entering  we were telling them   Would you please support the bill   And we don't have much technology like here  but we have our small phones. So we said   Why can't we get  their numbers and text them   So we did that. It was a good thing. So when the bill passed  we texted them back   Thank you for supporting the bill.  And when the bill was signed by the president  making it into law  it was a plus. Now  in Malawi     is the legal marriage age  from    to   . It's a good thing to know that the bill passed  but let me tell you this  There are countries where    is the legal marriage age  but don't we hear cries of women and girls every day  Every day  girls' lives are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders to honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment  it means keeping girls' issues at heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second  but they have to know that women  as we are in this room  we are not just women  we are not just girls  we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi  and not just Malawi but other countries  The laws which are there  you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced  The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries have been there  they need to be publicized at the local level  at the community level  where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues  difficult issues  at the community level every day. So if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them  they will be able to stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful  they are there  but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates  they have to jump in  to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need  good education  and above all  not to marry whilst   . And furthermore  I know that together  we can transform the legal  the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl  and millions of girls worldwide  will be able to say   I will marry when I want.  Thank you.  Applause \n",
      "Many times I go around the world to speak  and people ask me questions about the challenges  my moments  some of my regrets.       A single mother of four  three months after the birth of my fourth child  I went to do a job as a research assistant. I went to Northern Liberia. And as part of the work  the village would give you lodgings. And they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter. This girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade. She was the laughing stock of the community. Her mother was often told by other women   You and your child will die poor.  After two weeks of working in that village  it was time to go back. The mother came to me  knelt down  and said   Leymah  take my daughter. I wish for her to be a nurse.  Dirt poor  living in the home with my parents  I couldn't afford to. With tears in my eyes  I said   No.  Two months later  I go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief. The women's chief of the village has this little girl  fair color like me  totally dirty. And all day she walked around only in her underwear. When I asked   Who is that   She said   That's Wei. The meaning of her name is pig. Her mother died while giving birth to her  and no one had any idea who her father was.  For two weeks  she became my companion  slept with me. I bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll. The night before I left  she came to the room and said   Leymah  don't leave me here. I wish to go with you. I wish to go to school.  Dirt poor  no money  living with my parents  I again said   No.  Two months later  both of those villages fell into another war. Till today  I have no idea where those two girls are. Fast forward        In the peak of our activism  the minister of Gender Liberia called me and said   Leymah  I have a nine year old for you. I want you to bring her home because we don't have safe homes.  The story of this little girl  She had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months. She came to me bloated  very pale. Every night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor. She'd lie beside me and say   Auntie  I wish to be well. I wish to go to school.        A young woman stands before President Sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together  their father and mother died during the war. She's     her dream is to go to college to be able to support them. She's highly athletic. One of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship. Full scholarship. She gets it. Her dream of going to school  her wish of being educated  is finally here. She goes to school on the first day. The director of sports who's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class. And for the next three years  her fate will be having sex with him every day  as a favor for getting her in school. Globally  we have policies  international instruments  work leaders. Great people have made commitments    we will protect our children from want and from fear. The U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Countries like America  we've heard things like No Child Left Behind. Other countries come with different things. There is a Millennium Development called Three that focuses on girls. All of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally  I think  has failed. In Liberia  for example  the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every    girls. Teen prostitution is at its peak. In one community  we're told  you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper. Girls as young as    being prostituted for less than a dollar a night. It's disheartening  it's sad. And then someone asked me  just before my TEDTalk  a few days ago   So where is the hope   Several years ago  a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women. It's not enough to say you have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia when your girls' kids are totally out there and no hope  or seemingly no hope. We created a space called the Young Girls Transformative Project. We go into rural communities and all we do  like has been done in this room  is create the space. When these girls sit  you unlock intelligence  you unlock passion  you unlock commitment  you unlock focus  you unlock great leaders. Today  we've worked with over    . And some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps  as young mothers  to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women. One young woman I met  teen mother of four  never thought about finishing high school  graduated successfully  never thought about going to college  enrolled in college. One day she said to me   My wish is to finish college and be able to support my children.  She's at a place where she can't find money to go to school. She sells water  sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones. And you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education. Juanita is her name. She takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school. Says   Leymah  my wish is to be educated. And if I can't be educated  when I see some of my sisters being educated  my wish has been fulfilled. I wish for a better life. I wish for food for my children. I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop.  This is the dream of the African girl. Several years ago  there was one African girl. This girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry. Angry  frustrated  really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children  this young girl started a movement  a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace. I will fulfill the wish. This is another African girl's wish. I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls. I failed to do this. These were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman    I failed  I failed  I failed. So I will do this. Women came out  protested a brutal dictator  fearlessly spoke. Not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true  the wish of peace came true. This young woman wished also to go to school. She went to school. This young woman wished for other things to happen  it happened for her. Today  this young woman is me  a Nobel laureate. I'm now on a journey to fulfill the wish  in my tiny capacity  of little African girls    the wish of being educated. We set up a foundation. We're giving full four year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential. I don't have much to ask of you. I've also been to places in this U.S.  and I know that girls in this country also have wishes  a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx  a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown L.A.  a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas  a wish for a better life somewhere in New York  a wish for a better life somewhere in New Jersey. Will you journey with me to help that girl  be it an African girl or an American girl or a Japanese girl  fulfill her wish  fulfill her dream  achieve that dream  Because all of these great innovators and inventors that we've talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world  and all they're asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence  unlock the passion  unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves. Let's journey together. Let's journey together. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much. Right now in Liberia  what do you see as the main issue that troubles you  LG  I've been asked to lead the Liberian Reconciliation Initiative. As part of my work  I'm doing these tours in different villages and towns           hours on dirt roads    and there is no community that I've gone into that I haven't seen intelligent girls. But sadly  the vision of a great future  or the dream of a great future  is just a dream  because you have all of these vices. Teen pregnancy  like I said  is epidemic. So what troubles me is that I was at that place and somehow I'm at this place  and I just don't want to be the only one at this place. I'm looking for ways for other girls to be with me. I want to look back    years from now and see that there's another Liberian girl  Ghanaian girl  Nigerian girl  Ethiopian girl standing on this TED stage. And maybe  just maybe  saying   Because of that Nobel laureate I'm here today.  So I'm troubled when I see them like there's no hope. But I'm also not pessimistic  because I know it doesn't take a lot to get them charged up. CA  And in the last year  tell us one hopeful thing that you've seen happening. LG  I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening. But in the last year  where President Sirleaf comes from  her village  we went there to work with these girls. And we could not find    girls in high school. All of these girls went to the gold mine  and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things. We took    of those girls and we worked with them. And this was at the beginning of elections. This is one place where women were never    even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men. These girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration. This is a real rural village. And the theme they used was   Even pretty girls vote.  They were able to mobilize young women. But not only did they do that  they went to those who were running for seats to ask them   What is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win   And one of the guys who already had a seat was very    because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws  and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric. Rape is not barbaric  but the law  he said  was barbaric. And when the girls started engaging him  he was very hostile towards them. These little girls turned to him and said   We will vote you out of office.  He's out of office today. CA  Leymah  thank you. Thank you so much for coming to TED. LG  You're welcome.  CA  Thank you. \n",

      "So little Billy goes to school  and he sits down and the teacher says   What does your father do   And little Billy says   My father plays the piano in an opium den.  So the teacher rings up the parents  and says   Very shocking story from little Billy today. Just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den.  And the father says   I'm very sorry. Yes  it's true  I lied. But how can I tell an eight year old boy that his father is a politician    Laughter  Now  as a politician myself  standing in front of you  or indeed  meeting any stranger anywhere in the world  when I eventually reveal the nature of my profession  they look at me as though I'm somewhere between a snake  a monkey and an iguana  and through all of this  I feel  strongly  that something is going wrong. Four hundred years of maturing democracy  colleagues in Parliament who seem to me  as individuals  reasonably impressive  an increasingly educated  energetic  informed population  and yet a deep  deep sense of disappointment. My colleagues in Parliament include  in my new intake  family doctors  businesspeople  professors  distinguished economists  historians  writers  army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors. All of them  however  including myself  as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road  feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts  feel as though we have become profoundly diminished. And this isn't just a problem in Britain. It's a problem across the developing world  and in middle income countries too. In Jamaica  for example    look at Jamaican members of Parliament  you meet them  and they're often people who are Rhodes Scholars  who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton  and yet  you go down to downtown Kingston  and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites that you can see in any middle income country in the world  a dismal  depressing landscape of burnt and half abandoned buildings. And this has been true for    years  and the handover in             between one Jamaican leader who was the son of a Rhodes Scholar and a Q.C. to another who'd done an economics doctorate at Harvard  over     people were killed in the streets in drug related violence. Ten years ago  however  the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary. George W. Bush stood up in his State of the Union address in      and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the world. He said  because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors  freedom will bring peace. Distinguished academics at the same time argued that democracies had this incredible range of side benefits. They would bring prosperity  security  overcome sectarian violence  ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists. Since then  what's happened  Well  what we've seen is the creation  in places like Iraq and Afghanistan  of democratic systems of government which haven't had any of those side benefits. In Afghanistan  for example  we haven't just had one election or two elections. We've gone through three elections  presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find  Do we find a flourishing civil society  a vigorous rule of law and good security  No. What we find in Afghanistan is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt  a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective  a media which is beginning to get onto its feet but a government that's deeply unpopular  perceived as being deeply corrupt  and security that is shocking  security that's terrible. In Pakistan  in lots of sub Saharan Africa  again you can see democracy and elections are compatible with corrupt governments  with states that are unstable and dangerous. And when I have conversations with people  I remember having a conversation  for example  in Iraq  with a community that asked me whether the riot we were seeing in front of us  this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building  was a sign of the new democracy. The same  I felt  was true in almost every single one of the middle and developing countries that I went to  and to some extent the same is true of us. Well  what is the answer to this  Is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy  Well  obviously not. It would be absurd if we were to engage again in the kind of operations we were engaged in  in Iraq and Afghanistan if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation in which we were imposing anything other than a democratic system. Anything else would run contrary to our values  it would run contrary to the wishes of the people on the ground  it would run contrary to our interests. I remember in Iraq  for example  that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy. We went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned from Bosnia was that elections held too early enshrined sectarian violence  enshrined extremist parties  so in Iraq in      the decision was made  let's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in voter education. Let's invest in democratization. The result was that I found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people  this is actually a photograph taken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq of people standing outside screaming for the elections  and when I went out and said   What is wrong with the interim provincial council  What is wrong with the people that we have chosen  There is a Sunni sheikh  there's a Shiite sheikh  there's the seven    leaders of the seven major tribes  there's a Christian  there's a Sabian  there are female representatives  there's every political party in this council  what's wrong with the people that we chose   The answer came   The problem isn't the people that you chose. The problem is that you chose them.  I have not met  in Afghanistan  in even the most remote community  anybody who does not want a say in who governs them. Most remote community  I have never met a villager who does not want a vote. So we need to acknowledge that despite the dubious statistics  despite the fact that    percent of people in Britain feel politics is broken  despite the fact that when I was in Iraq  we did an opinion poll in      and asked people what political systems they preferred  and the answer came back that seven percent wanted the United States  five percent wanted France  three percent wanted Britain  and nearly    percent wanted Dubai  which is  after all  not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous minor monarchy  democracy is a thing of value for which we should be fighting. But in order to do so we need to get away from instrumental arguments. We need to get away from saying democracy matters because of the other things it brings. We need to get away from feeling  in the same way  human rights matters because of the other things it brings  or women's rights matters for the other things it brings. Why should we get away from those arguments  Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying  for example  torture is wrong because it doesn't extract good information  or we say  you need women's rights because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force  you leave yourself open to the position where the government of North Korea can turn around and say   Well actually  we're having a lot of success extracting good information with our torture at the moment   or the government of Saudi Arabia to say   Well  our economic growth's okay  thank you very much  considerably better than yours  so maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights.  The point about democracy is not instrumental. It's not about the things that it brings. The point about democracy is not that it delivers legitimate  effective  prosperous rule of law. It's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors. The point about democracy is intrinsic. Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity  the dignity of the individual  the idea that each individual should have an equal vote  an equal say  in the formation of their government. But if we're really to make democracy vigorous again  if we're ready to revivify it  we need to get involved in a new project of the citizens and the politicians. Democracy is not simply a question of structures. It is a state of mind. It is an activity. And part of that activity is honesty. After I speak to you today  I'm going on a radio program called  Any Questions   and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never  ever say that they don't know the answer to a question. It doesn't matter what it is. If you ask about child tax credits  the future of the penguins in the south Antarctic  asked to hold forth on whether or not the developments in Chongqing contribute to sustainable development in carbon capture  and we will have an answer for you. We need to stop that  to stop pretending to be omniscient beings. Politicians also need to learn  occasionally  to say that certain things that voters want  certain things that voters have been promised  may be things that we cannot deliver or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver. And the second thing we should do is understand the genius of our societies. Our societies have never been so educated  have never been so energized  have never been so healthy  have never known so much  cared so much  or wanted to do so much  and it is a genius of the local. One of the reasons why we're moving away from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand  banqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling of kings enthroned  the entire drama played out here on this space  where the King of England had his head lopped off  why we've moved from spaces like this  thrones like that  towards the town hall  is we're moving more and more towards the energies of our people  and we need to tap that. That can mean different things in different countries. In Britain  it could mean looking to the French  learning from the French  getting directly elected mayors in place in a French commune system. In Afghanistan  it could have meant instead of concentrating on the big presidential and parliamentary elections  we should have done what was in the Afghan constitution from the very beginning  which is to get direct local elections going at a district level and elect people's provincial governors. But for any of these things to work  the honesty in language  the local democracy  it's not just a question of what politicians do. It's a question of what the citizens do. For politicians to be honest  the public needs to allow them to be honest  and the media  which mediates between the politicians and the public  needs to allow those politicians to be honest. If local democracy is to flourish  it is about the active and informed engagement of every citizen. In other words  if democracy is to be rebuilt  is to become again vigorous and vibrant  it is necessary not just for the public to learn to trust their politicians  but for the politicians to learn to trust the public. Thank you very much indeed.  Applause \n",
      "I want to argue to you that in fact  politics and religion  which are the two primary factors    not the sole  but overwhelmingly  the primary factors    which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely    bordering on the inevitable at this point  whether one is in favor of that or not    that politics and religion are  in fact  themselves better conceptualized as kinds of technology  and subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider in the space of conceptual design. Here's what I mean. Politics and    let's focus on the political system in particular question here  which is the system of democracy. Democracy  as a type of politics  is a technology for the control and deployment of power. You can deploy power in a wide range of ways. The famous ones    despotism is a good one  anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way  to do it in a radically diffused fashion  and democracy is a set of technologies  which have the effect of  in principle  diffusing the power source to a large number of people and then re concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern  and who themselves are  in principle  authorized to govern by virtue of what the broader public has done. Now  consider religion    in this case Islam  which is the religion that  in some direct sense  can be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter. Let me say parenthetically why I think that's the case  because I think it's a potentially controversial statement. I would put it in the following equation  no       no war. At the beginning of the Bush administration  when President Bush  now President Bush  was running for president  he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world. In fact  the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world. That's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol  for example. After       the tables were turned. And the president decided  with his advisors  to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us. That began with Afghanistan  and when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly  a decision was made through the technology of democracy    again  notice  not a perfect technology    but through the technology of democracy that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war    this time  a war in Iraq. Now  the reason I begin by saying  no       no war  is that we have to acknowledge that Islam  as interpreted by a very  very small  extremely radical group of people  was a precipitating cause of the      attacks    the precipitating cause of the      attacks    and as a consequence  at one degree of remove  the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in. And I would add that bin Laden and his followers are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy  or at least capitalist democracy  on the one hand  and the world of Islam as they see and define it. Now  how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus  Well  it's a technology for  first  salvation in its most basic sense. It's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer  but it's also meant by the Islamists    and I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam    they follow the slogan  Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions  whether they're social  or political  or personal  or spiritual. Within the sphere of people who have that view  and it's a large number of people in the Muslim world who disagree with bin Laden in his application  but agree that Islam is the answer. Islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals. And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are  in principle  peace  justice and equality  but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings. Now  I don't want to leave a misimpression by identifying either of these propositions    rather  either of these phenomena  democracy or Islam    as technologies. I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to. And I think a good way to prove this is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke. And I ran immediately into a conceptual problem  you can't show a picture of democracy. You can show a slogan  or a symbol  or a sign that stands for democracy. You can show the Capitol    I had the same problem when I was designing the cover of my forthcoming book  in fact    what do you put on the cover to show democracy  And the same problem with respect to Islam. You can show a mosque  or you can show worshippers  but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam. That's because these are the kinds of concepts that are not susceptible to easy representation. Now  it follows from that  that they're deeply contestable. It follows from that that all of the people in the world who say that they are Muslims can  in principle  subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations of what Islam really is  and the same is true of democracy. In other words  unlike the word hope  which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for  and  perhaps  reach some kind of a consensual use analysis  these are essentially contested concepts. They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense. And as a consequence of this disagreement  it's very  very difficult for anyone to say   I have the right version of Islam.  You know  post       we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of George W. Bush saying   Islam means peace.  Well  so says George W. Bush. Other people would say it means something else. Some people would say that Islam means submission. Other people would say it means an acknowledgement or recognition of God's sovereignty. There are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean. And ostensibly  the same is true of democracy. Some people say that democracy consists basically in elections. Other people say no  that's not enough  there have to be basic liberal rights  free speech  free press  equality of citizens. These are contested points  and it's impossible to answer them by saying   Ah ha  I looked in the right place  and I found out what these concepts mean.  Now  if Islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great confrontation  what does that mean  Well  you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks. You could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago  which was fear. Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner and with a very  very high likelihood that many  many people are going to die as a consequence of this confrontation    a confrontation which many  many people in the Muslim world do not want  many  many people in the American democracy do not want  many people elsewhere in the world do not want  but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people    at least in the relevant space  which is the United States    to actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all. And I think that that's  in fact  probably the first appropriate response. What I want to suggest to you  though  in the next couple of minutes is that there's also a hopeful response to this. And the hopeful response derives from recognizing that Islam and democracy are technologies. And by virtue of being technologies  they're manipulable. And they're manipulable in ways that can produce some extremely positive outcomes. What do I have in mind  Well  all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously  people who care about Islam  for whom it's a source either of faith  or of civilization  or of deep values  or just a source of powerful personal identity  who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict  but are in fact deeply compatible. And these Muslims    and it's the vast majority of Muslims    disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach  profoundly. And they furthermore think overwhelmingly    again one can't speak of every person  but overwhelmingly  and one can find this by reading any of the sources that they have produced  and they're all over the Internet and in all sorts of languages    one can see that they're saying that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves to have choice in the spheres of personal life  in the sphere of economics  in the sphere of politics  and  yes  in the sphere of religion  which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world. And many of these Muslims further say that their disagreement with the United States is that it  in the past and still in the present  has sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world in order to promote America's short term interests. Now  during the Cold War  that may have been a defensible position for the United States to take. That's an academic question. It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East  and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism. And it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other  and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them. But now that the Cold War is over  there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world    and pretty close to the same here in the United States  if you talk to people and ask them    that in principle  there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co exist. And we see this among activist  practical Muslims  like the Muslims who are presently the elected  parliamentary  democratic government of Turkey  who are behaving pragmatically  not ideologically  who are promoting their own religious values  who are elected by their own people because they were perceived as honest and sincere because of their religious values  but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance are fundamentally incompatible. Now  you may say  but surely  what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy    namely  free political choice  basic liberty and basic equality. But I'm here to tell you that technologies are more malleable than that. I'm here to tell you that many  many Muslims believe    the vast majority  in fact    in fact I think I would go so far as to say that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam  namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty and basic human equality before God  are themselves compatible with liberty  equality and free political choice. And there are Muslims  many Muslims out there  who are saying precisely this. And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it. But their governments  needless to say  are relatively threatened by this. And for the most part try to stop them from making this argument. So  for example  a group of young activists in Egypt try to form a party known as the Center Party  which advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy. They weren't even allowed to form a party. They were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there. Why  Because they would have done extraordinarily well. In the most recent elections in the Muslim world    which are those in Pakistan  those in Morocco and those in Turkey    in each case  people who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats were far and away the most successful vote getters every place they were allowed to run freely. So in Morocco  for example  they finished third in the political race but they were only allowed to contest half the seats. So had they contested a larger number of the seats  they would have done even better. Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world. And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims    who care very  very deeply about their traditions  who do not want to compromise those values    believe  through the malleability of the technology of democracy and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam  that these two ideas can work together. Now what would that look like  What does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy  Well  one thing is  it's not going to look identical to democracy as we know it in the United States. That may be a good thing  in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today    for example  in the regulatory context    of what democracy produces. It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room  or Muslims out in the rest of the world    I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here  there probably are    conceptualize Islam. It will be transformative of Islam as well. And as a result of this convergence  this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together  there's a real possibility that  instead of a clash of Islamic civilization    if there is such a thing    and democratic civilization    if there is such a thing    we'll in fact have close compatibility. Now  I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room  and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war if you're talking about these issues. The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war  many Muslims will conclude that the United States is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government. On the other hand  there's a further possibility that many Americans  swept up in the fever of a war  will say  and feel  and think that Islam is the enemy somehow    that Islam ought to be construed as the enemy. And even though  for political tactical reasons  the president has been very  very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy  nonetheless  there's a natural impulse when one enters war to think of the other side as an enemy. And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize  as much as possible  in defining who that enemy is. So the risks are very great. On the other hand  the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated  even by  and I would say especially by  people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place. Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens  it cannot be the right strategy  either pragmatically  or spiritually  or morally  to say after the war   Well  let's let it all run itself out  and play out however it wants to play out  because we opposed the war in the first place.  That's not the way human circumstances operate. You face the circumstances you have in front of you and you go forward. Well  what I'm here to say then is  for people who are skeptical about the war  it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the United States and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly Islamic. And it is crucial    it is crucial in a practical  activist way    for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy  in this system  they exercise their preferences  their choices and their voices to encourage that outcome. That's a hopeful message  but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it as incurring serious obligation for all of us. And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation  but only if we put what we can into it. And if we do  then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether. Thanks.\n",
      "I'm afraid I'm one of those speakers you hope you're not going to meet at TED. First  I don't have a mobile  so I'm on the safe side. Secondly  a political theorist who's going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about. And plus  I'm not going to give you any answers. I'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we're talking about. And one of the things that I want to question is this very popular hope these days that transparency and openness can restore the trust in democratic institutions. There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me. You people  the Church of TED  are a very optimistic community. Basically you believe in complexity  but not in ambiguity. As you have been told  I'm Bulgarian. And according to the surveys  we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world. The Economist magazine recently wrote an article covering one of the recent studies on happiness  and the title was  The Happy  the Unhappy and the Bulgarians.  So now when you know what to expect  let's give you the story. And this is a rainy election day in a small country    that can be my country  but could be also your country. And because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon  nobody went to the polling stations. But then the rain stopped  people went to vote. And when the votes had been counted  three fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot. The government and the opposition  they have been simply paralyzed. Because you know what to do about the protests. You know who to arrest  who to negotiate with. But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot  So the government decided to have the elections once again. And this time even a greater number     percent of the people  voted with blank ballots. Basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for. This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago called  Seeing.  But in my view it very well captures part of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days. On one level nobody's questioning that democracy is the best form of government. Democracy is the only game in town. The problem is that many people start to believe that it is not a game worth playing. For the last    years  political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout  and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting. I mean the unemployed  the under privileged. And this is a major issue. Because especially now with the economic crisis  you can see that the trust in politics  that the trust in democratic institutions  was really destroyed. According to the latest survey being done by the European Commission     percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap between the opinion of the policy makers and the opinion of the public. Only    percent of Italians and    percent of Greeks believe that their vote matters. Basically people start to understand that they can change governments  but they cannot change policies. And the question which I want to ask is the following  How did it happen that we are living in societies which are much freer than ever before    we have more rights  we can travel easier  we have access to more information    at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions basically has collapsed  So basically I want to ask  What went right and what went wrong in these    years when we talk about democracy  And I'll start with what went right. And the first thing that went right was  of course  these five revolutions which  in my view  very much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience. And the first was the cultural and social revolution of      and     s  which put the individual at the center of politics. It was the human rights moment. Basically this was also a major outbreak  a culture of dissent  a culture of basically non conformism  which was not known before. So I do believe that even things like that are very much the children of '      nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then. But after that you have the market revolution of the     s. And nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it  the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message   The government does not know better.  And you have more choice driven societies. And of course  you have         the end of Communism  the end of the Cold War. And it was the birth of the global world. And you have the Internet. And this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach to what extent the Internet empowered people. It has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics. The very idea of political community totally has changed. And I'm going to name one more revolution  and this is the revolution in brain sciences  which totally changed the way we understand how people are making decisions. So this is what went right. But if we're going to see what went wrong  we're going to end up with the same five revolutions. Because first you have the     s and     s  cultural and social revolution  which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose. The very idea  all these collective nouns that we have been taught about    nation  class  family. We start to like divorcing  if we're married at all. All this was very much under attack. And it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand. And you have the market revolution of the     s and the huge increase of inequality in societies. Remember  until the     s  the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality. The more democratic our societies have been  the more equal they have been becoming. Now we have the reverse tendency. The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality. And I find this very much disturbing when we're talking about what's going on right and wrong with democracy these days. And if you go to         something that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize    but many are going to tell you   Listen  it was the end of the Cold War that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe.  When the Soviet Union was still there  the rich and the powerful  they needed the people  because they feared them. Now the elites basically have been liberated. They're very mobile. You cannot tax them. And basically they don't fear the people. So as a result of it  you have this very strange situation in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters. So this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore. And when we talk about the Internet  yes  it's true  the Internet connected all of us  but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to. And it's becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are not like you. I know that many people here have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation  but  have you  seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days  This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution. This is the other side of the things that we like. And when you go to the brain sciences  what political consultants learned from the brain scientists is don't talk to me about ideas anymore  don't talk to me about policy programs. What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people. And you have this very strongly to the extent that  even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days  these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas. Before  revolutions used to have ideological names. They could be communist  they could be liberal  they could be fascist or Islamic. Now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used. You have Facebook revolutions  Twitter revolutions. The content doesn't matter anymore  the problem is the media. I'm saying this because one of my major points is what went right is also what went wrong. And when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation  when basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy  we should keep this ambiguity in mind. Because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most. These days it's very popular to believe that this push for transparency  this kind of a combination between active citizens  new technologies and much more transparency friendly legislation can restore trust in politics. You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this  it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie  it's going to be more difficult for them to steal and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill. This is probably true. But I do believe that we should be also very clear that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics where the message is   It's transparency  stupid.  Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions. Transparency is politics' management of mistrust. We are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust. And by the way  mistrust was always very important for democracy. This is why you have checks and balances. This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent. But when politics is only management of mistrust  then    I'm very glad that        has been mentioned    now we're going to have        in reverse. It's not going to be the Big Brother watching you  it's going to be we being the Big Brother watching the political class. But is this the idea of a free society  For example  can you imagine that decent  civic  talented people are going to run for office if they really do believe that politics is also about managing mistrust  Are you not afraid with all these technologies that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues  are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat their positions  even the very wrong positions  because consistency is going to be more important than common sense  And the Americans who are in the room  are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern on the basis of what they said in the primary elections  I find this extremely important  because democracy is about people changing their views based on rational arguments and discussions. And we can lose this with the very noble idea to keep people accountable for showing the people that we're not going to tolerate politicians the opportunism in politics. So for me this is extremely important. And I do believe that when we're discussing politics these days  probably it makes sense to look also at this type of a story. But also don't forget  any unveiling is also veiling.  Regardless of  how transparent our governments want to be  they're going to be selectively transparent. In a small country that could be my country  but could be also your country  they took a decision    it is a real case story    that all of the governmental decisions  discussions of the council of ministers  were going to be published on the Internet    hours after the council discussions took place. And the public was extremely all for it. So I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister  why he made this decision. He said   Listen  this is the best way to keep the mouths of my ministers closed. Because it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent knowing that    hours after this is going to be on the public space  and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis.  So when we talk about transparency  when we talk about openness  I really do believe that what we should keep in mind is that what went right is what went wrong. And this is Goethe  who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist  some centuries ago he said   There is a big shadow where there is much light.  Thank you very much.\n",
      "Have you ever wondered why extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim majority countries over the course of the last decade  Have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around  Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings and thought   How could we have predicted that   or  How could we have better prepared for that   Well my personal story  my personal journey  what brings me to the TED stage here today  is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening in Muslim majority countries over the course of the last decades  at least  and beyond. I want to share some of that story with you  but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim majority societies. So let me begin by first of all giving a very  very brief history of time  if I may indulge. In medieval societies there were defined allegiances. An identity was defined primarily by religion. And then we moved on into an era in the   th century with the rise of a European nation state where identities and allegiances were defined by ethnicity. So identity was primarily defined by ethnicity  and the nation state reflected that. In the age of globalization  we moved on. I call it the era of citizenship    where people could be from multi racial  multi ethnic backgrounds  but all be equal as citizens in a state. You could be American Italian  you could be American Irish  you could be British Pakistani. But I believe now that we're moving into a new age  and that age The New York Times dubbed recently as  the age of behavior.  How I define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegiances  where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives. And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave. Now this is not all necessarily good news  because it's also my belief that hatred has gone global just as much as love. But actually it's my belief that the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior  up until now  up until recent times  up until the last six months  the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances  using digital activism and other sorts of borderless technologies  those who've been benefiting from this have been extremists. And that's something which I'd like to elaborate on. If we look at Islamists  if we look at the phenomenon of far right fascists  one thing they've been very good at  one thing that they've actually been exceeding in  is communicating across borders  using technologies to organize themselves  to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena. Now I should know  because for    years of my life  I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization. And I was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders  and I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism as distinct from Islam the faith  and the way in which it influenced my co religionists across the world. And my story  my personal story  is truly evidence for the age of behavior that I'm attempting to elaborate upon here. I was  by the way    I'm an Essex lad  born and raised in Essex in the U.K. Anyone who's from England knows the reputation we have from Essex. But having been born in Essex  at the age of     I joined an organization. At the age of     I was recruiting people from Cambridge University to this organization. At the age of     I was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K. At the age of     I was co founding this organization in Pakistan. At the age of     I was co founding this organization in Denmark. By the age of     I found myself convicted in prison in Egypt  being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments  being subjected to torture in Egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience. Now that journey  and what took me from Essex all the way across the world    by the way  we were laughing at democratic activists. We felt they were from the age of yesteryear. We felt that they were out of date. I learned how to use email from the extremist organization that I used. I learned how to effectively communicate across borders without being detected. Eventually I was detected  of course  in Egypt. But the way in which I learned to use technology to my advantage was because I was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation state. The age of behavior  where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances. So as I said  we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it. And it's not just Islamist extremists that did this. But even if you look across the mood music in Europe of late  far right fascism is also on the rise. A form of anti Islam rhetoric is also on the rise and it's transnational. And the consequences that this is having is that it's affecting the political climate across Europe. What's actually happening is that what were previously localized parochialisms  individual or groupings of extremists who were isolated from one another  have become interconnected in a globalized way and have thus become  or are becoming  mainstream. Because the Internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world. If you look at the rise of far right fascism across Europe of late  you will see some things that are happening that are influencing domestic politics  yet the phenomenon is transnational. In certain countries  mosque minarets are being banned. In others  headscarves are being banned. In others  kosher and halal meat are being banned  as we speak. And on the flip side  we have transnational Islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies. And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream. Now that never would have been possible before. They would have felt isolated  until these sorts of technologies came around and connected them in a way that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon. Where does that leave democracy aspirants  Well I believe they're getting left far behind. And I'll give you an example here at this stage. If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot  there's a man called Anwar al Awlaki. As an American citizen  ethnically a Yemeni  in hiding currently in Yemen  who inspired a Nigerian  son of the head of Nigeria's national bank. This Nigerian student studied in London  trained in Yemen  boarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America. In the meanwhile  the Old mentality with a capital O  was represented by his father  the head of the Nigerian bank  warning the CIA that his own son was about to attack  and this warning fell on deaf ears. The Old mentality with a capital O  as represented by the nation state  not yet fully into the age of behavior  not recognizing the power of transnational social movements  got left behind. And the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the United States of America. Again with the example of the far right  that we find  ironically  xenophobic nationalists are utilizing the benefits of globalization. So why are they succeeding  And why are democracy aspirants falling behind  Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this. And a social movement is comprised  in my view  it's comprised of four main characteristics. It's comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders. I'll talk you through one example  and that's the example that everyone here will be aware of  and that's the example of Al Qaeda. If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al Qaeda  that's something that comes to your mind immediately. If I ask you to think of their narratives    the West being at war with Islam  the need to defend Islam against the West    these narratives  they come to your mind immediately. Incidentally  the difference between ideas and narratives  the idea is the cause that one believes in  and the narrative is the way to sell that cause    the propaganda  if you like  of the cause. So the ideas and the narratives of Al Qaeda come to your mind immediately. If I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders  they come to your mind immediately. One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently. So these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately. And that's the power of social movements. They're transnational  and they bond around these ideas and narratives and these symbols and these leaders. However  if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan  and I ask you to think of the symbols and the leaders for democracy in Pakistan today  you'll be hard pressed to think beyond perhaps the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. Which means  by definition  that particular leader no longer exists. One of the problems we're facing is  in my view  that there are no globalized  youth led  grassroots social movements advocating for democratic culture across Muslim majority societies. There is no equivalent of the Al Qaeda  without the terrorism  for democracy across Muslim majority societies. There are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground. So that begs the next question. Why is it that extremist organizations  whether of the far right or of the Islamist extremism    Islamism meaning those who wish to impose one version of Islam over the rest of society    why is it that they are succeeding in organizing in a globalized way  whereas those who aspire to democratic culture are falling behind  And I believe that's for four reasons. I believe  number one  it's complacency. Because those who aspire to democratic culture are in power  or have societies that are leading globalized  powerful societies  powerful countries. And that level of complacency means they don't feel the need to advocate for that culture. The second  I believe  is political correctness. That we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that    we associate believing in the universality of our values    with extremists. Yet actually  whenever we talk about human rights  we do say that human rights are universal. But actually going out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with Islamist extremism. To go around saying that I believe democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism. And the third  democratic choice in Muslim majority societies has been relegated to a political choice  meaning political parties in many of these societies ask people to vote for them as the democratic party  but then the other parties ask them to vote for them as the military party    wanting to rule by military dictatorship. And then you have a third party saying   Vote for us  we'll establish a theocracy.  So democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political choices available in those societies. And what happens as a result of this is  when those parties are elected  and inevitably they fail  or inevitably they make political mistakes  democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes. And then people say   We've tried democracy. It doesn't really work. Let's bring the military back again.  And the fourth reason  I believe  is what I've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance. What I mean by that is  if the world superpower today was a communist  it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism  than it is today with the world superpower being America  occupying certain lands and also espousing democratic ideals. So roughly these four reasons make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread as a civilizational choice  not merely as a political choice. When talking about those reasons  let's break down certain preconceptions. Is it just about grievances  Is it just about a lack of education  Well statistically  the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated. Statistically  they are educated  on average  above the education levels of Western society. Anecdotally  we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor  well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia. His deputy  Ayman al Zawahiri  was a pediatrician    not an ill educated man. International aid and development has been going on for years  but extremism in those societies  in many of those societies  has been on the rise. And what I believe is missing is genuine grassroots activism on the ground  in addition to international aid  in addition to education  in addition to health. Not exclusive to these things  but in addition to them  is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground. And this is where I believe neoconservatism had it upside down. Neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply led approach to impose democratic values from the top down. Whereas Islamists and far right organizations  for decades  have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots. They've been building civilizational demand for their values on the grassroots  and we've been seeing those societies slowly transition to societies that are increasingly asking for a form of Islamism. Mass movements in Pakistan have been represented after the Arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming for some form of theocracy  rather than for a democratic uprising. Because since pre partition  they've been building demand for their ideology on the ground. And what's needed is a genuine transnational youth led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture    which is necessarily more than just elections. But without freedom of speech  you can't have free and fair elections. Without human rights  you don't have the protection granted to you to campaign. Without freedom of belief  you don't have the right to join organizations. So what's needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself to create the demand on the ground for this culture. What that will do is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier  where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy. Whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level  rather than merely on a political level  a level above politics    movements that are not political parties  but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture. What we'll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here    the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy  not for a democracy. But to get to that stage  where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric  but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship    i.e. you're voting in a democracy  in an existing democracy  and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box. To get to that stage  we genuinely need to start building demand in those societies on the ground. Now to conclude  how does that happen  Well  Egypt is a good starting point. The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning. But what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt was particularly cathartic for me. What happened there was a political coalition gathered together for a political goal  and that was to remove the leader. We need to move one step beyond that now. We need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions  loosely based political coalitions  to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground. Because it's not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator. That doesn't guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values. But generally  the trends that start in Egypt have historically spread across the MENA region  the Middle East and North Africa region. So when Arab socialism started in Egypt  it spread across the region. In the '  s and '  s when Islamism started in the region  it spread across the MENA region as a whole. And the aspiration that we have at the moment    as young Arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism    is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that. But that will require helping these societies transition from having merely political coalitions to building genuinely grassroots based social movements that advocate for the democratic culture. And we've made a start for that in Pakistan with a movement called Khudi  where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine buy in for the democratic culture. And it's with that thought that I'll end. And my time is up  and thank you for your time.\n",
      "Today I want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war. These are not normally the most cheerful of topics  nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about. Yet  not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago  but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict. Three things stand out  leadership  diplomacy and institutional design. What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter  how they matter  and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways  that is  how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last. But let's start at the beginning. Civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now  and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat. For nearly two decades now  the news has been bad and the images have been haunting. In Georgia  after years of stalemate  we saw a full scale resurgence of violence in August      . This quickly escalated into a five day war between Russia and Georgia  leaving Georgia ever more divided. In Kenya  contested presidential elections in         we just heard about them    quickly led to high levels of inter ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people. In Sri Lanka  a decades long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in       after perhaps as many as         people had been killed since     . In Kyrgyzstan  just over the last few weeks  unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks. Hundreds have been killed  and more than         displaced  including many ethnic Uzbeks who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan. In the Middle East  conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated  and it becomes ever more difficult to see how  just how a possible  sustainable solution can be achieved. Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines  but the killing and displacement there continues as well  and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom. And in Iraq  finally  violence is on the rise again  and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections. But hang on  this talk is to be about the good news. So are these now the images of the past  Well  notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East  Darfur  Iraq  elsewhere  there is a longer term trend that does represent some good news. Over the past two decades  since the end of the Cold War  there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars. Since the high in the early     s  with about    such civil wars ongoing  we now have    percent fewer such conflicts today. The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two. But this trend is less unambiguous. The highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between      and       with about        soldiers  policemen and rebels killed every year. The lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in       with just        killed. Despite the up and down since then  the overall trend    and this is the important bit    clearly points downward for the past two decades. The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be. From over        civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in      and       a decade later  this figure stands at      . This is a decrease by two thirds. This decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda in     . But then         civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months. This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed. What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story. They exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war  from hunger or disease  for example. And they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally. Torture  rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective  if often non lethal  weapons in civil war. To put it differently  for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war  there is no good war and there is no bad peace. Thus  even though every civilian killed  maimed  raped  or tortured is one too many  the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago  is good news. So  we have fewer conflicts today in which fewer people get killed. And the big question  of course  is why  In some cases  there is a military victory of one side. This is a solution of sorts  but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences. The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this  but we have seen similar so called military solutions in the Balkans  in the South Caucasus and across most of Africa. At times  they are complimented by negotiated settlements  or at least cease fire agreements  and peacekeepers are deployed. But hardly ever do they represent a resounding success    Bosnia and Herzegovina perhaps more so than Georgia. But for many parts of Africa  a colleague of mine once put it this way   The cease fire on Tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning.  But let's look at the good news again. If there's no solution on the battlefield  three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war  or for sustainable peace afterwards  leadership  diplomacy and institutional design. Take the example of Northern Ireland. Despite centuries of animosity  decades of violence and thousands of people killed       saw the conclusion of an historic agreement. Its initial version was skillfully mediated by Senator George Mitchell. Crucially  for the long term success of the peace process in Northern Ireland  he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations. Central among them  a commitment to exclusively peaceful means. Subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments  who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland. The core institutions that were put in place in      and their modifications in      and      were highly innovative and allowed all conflict parties to see their core concerns and demands addressed. The agreement combines a power sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland with cross border institutions that link Belfast and Dublin and thus recognizes the so called Irish dimension of the conflict. And significantly  there's also a clear focus on both the rights of individuals and the rights of communities. The provisions in the agreement may be complex  but so is the underlying conflict. Perhaps most importantly  local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise  not always fast and not always enthusiastically  but rise in the end they did. Who ever could have imagined Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness jointly governing Northern Ireland as First and Deputy First Minister  But then  is Northern Ireland a unique example  or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries  By no means. The ending of Liberia's long lasting civil war in      illustrates the importance of leadership  diplomacy and institutional design as much as the successful prevention of a full scale civil war in Macedonia in       or the successful ending of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in     . In all three cases  local leaders were willing and able to make peace  the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement  and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agreed. Focusing on leadership  diplomacy and institutional design also helps explain failures to achieve peace  or to make it last. The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords did not lead to an end of the Israeli Palestinian conflict. Not all the issues that needed to be resolved were actually covered in the agreements. Rather  local leaders committed to revisiting them later on. Yet instead of grasping this opportunity  local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second Intifada  the events of      and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan signed in      turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged  and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full scale return to war between north and south. Changes and shortcomings in leadership  more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure. Unresolved boundary issues  squabbles over oil revenues  the ongoing conflict in Darfur  escalating tribal violence in the south and generally weak state capacity across all of Sudan complete a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in Africa's largest country. A final example  Kosovo. The failure to achieve a negotiated solution for Kosovo and the violence  tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many  many different factors. Central among them are three. First  the intransigence of local leaders to settle for nothing less than their maximum demands. Second  an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by Western support for Kosovo's independence. And third  a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of Serbs and Albanians alike. By the same token    and here we have some good news again    the very fact that there is a high level  well resourced international presence in Kosovo and the Balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint  explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since     . So even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal  local leaders and international leaders have a choice  and they can make a difference for the better. A cold war is not as good as a cold peace  but a cold peace is still better than a hot war. Good news is also about learning the right lesson. So what then distinguishes the Israeli Palestinian conflict from that in Northern Ireland  or the civil war in Sudan from that in Liberia  Both successes and failures teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue. First  leadership. In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man made disasters  their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either. Leadership needs to be capable  determined and visionary in its commitment to peace. Leaders need to connect to each other and to their followers  and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future. Second  diplomacy. Diplomacy needs to be well resourced  sustained  and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers. It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise  and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local  regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement. Third  institutional design. Institutional design requires a keen focus on issues  innovative thinking and flexible and well funded implementation. Conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other's needs. And they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them. Conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table if the agreement implementation stalls. For me personally  the most critical lesson of all is this  Local commitment to peace is all important  but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence. Yet  no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have. Therefore  we must invest in developing leaders  leaders that have the skills  vision and determination to make peace. Leaders  in other words  that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices. A final thought  Ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers  frustrations and setbacks. It often takes a generation to accomplish  but it also requires us  today's generation  to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership  diplomacy and institutional design  so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow.
