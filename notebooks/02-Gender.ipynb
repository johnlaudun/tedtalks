    "One avenue of research in this project examines what -- if any -- relationship exists between the gender of a TED speaker and the talk that they give. To explore this line of thinking, we would need to have access to the gender that each speaker identifies with. \n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of the data on the TED webpages is that there is no demographic information about the speakers such as age, race, or gender. In this notebook, we craft a method for detecting speakers' genders from the existing data within the collated speaker information from the TED website, including `speaker_occupation`, `speaker_introduction`, and `speaker_profile`. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts to this method: 1) an automated gender detector, and 2) a non-automated procedure. For the first step, we extract the number and kinds of pronouns used in each of the three speaker variables: `speaker_occupation`, `speaker_introduction`, and `speaker_profile`. We then take a conservative approach to guessing a speaker's gender where the vast majority of pronouns need to be either stereotypically male or female. For any person who do not meet such a condition, we then work to determine their self-identified gender by reading their speaker information and referencing other media about the person. For anyone that we needed additional resources, they are noted in the resulting gender file. \n"

In this step, we compute the ratios of 1) male pronouns compared to all pronouns, 2) female pronouns compared to all pronouns, and 3) non-binary pronouns compared to all pronouns. If either of the first two ratios are very high, then we classify the speaker as male or female, respectively. We are very conservative in applying these labels, as we do not want to mis-identify any speakers.
