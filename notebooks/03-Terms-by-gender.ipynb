    "> The rest of the hand-examination turns up no other issues, so the basic vectorization built into `sklearn` appears to be satisfactory, with the only exception being its breaking of contractions at the apostrophe: e.g., *isn't* becomes *isn* and *'t*, with the latter being thrown away as too small -- which means that the indefinite article *a(n)* is also not present in the frequencies, but the definite article *the* remains.

The eventual workaround is to clean the texts of the top 20 parentheticals, joining the list back to a string, and then pushing the result to sklearn.
