We use Python's `Sci-Kit Learn` library to create a document - term frequency matrix with a shape of 1747 x 50379. Summing the words to get a total for each word across all talks in the dataset, we then hand-inspect the totals and discover that there is a small list of numbers that recur. We approach mapping those numbers in two trials before returning to the task of getting a clean frequency list with no repetitions or other oddities."
