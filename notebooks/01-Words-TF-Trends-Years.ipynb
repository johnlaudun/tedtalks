The first time around we are going to do the combined dataset and look for overall trends, and then we will follow that up by loading both the `only` and `plus` datasets separately to see if there are any differences worth noting. Our goal here is to see what words trend not only to learn about TED talks as a developing collection of events but it might also be possible to compare the trends glimpsed here against either trends from the BYU corpus or Google Trends itself."
