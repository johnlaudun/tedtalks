    "This notebook captures subsequent work on gender and vocabulary in the Tedtalks corpus. I've had a few weeks to think about the previous work and to think about various factors that may or may not affect our understanding. This notebook began as a copy of the previous notebook, `Tt-08-vocab-gender` and reuses a small portion of the code. I began work here with the assumption that what we need to build is a new dataframe with each row a word. Here is my tentative sketch of columns needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "    WORD, OVERALL FREQ, OVERALL RF, F FREQ, F RF, M FREQ, M RF\n",
    "\n",
    "    FREQ =  frequency (number of times a word occurs)\n",
    "    RF   =  relative frequency (number of times a word occurs \n",
    "            divided by the total number of words)\n",
    "    F    =  speaker is a woman\n",
    "    M    =  speaker is a man\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as I got done with this and filtered the dataframe by the usage of PMS and saw that it came down to two talks, one by a woman and one by a man, I realized we probably needed to add columns for number of talks in overall, women, and men."
