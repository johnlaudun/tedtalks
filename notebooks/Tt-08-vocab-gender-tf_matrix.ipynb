    "The reason for switching from the more traditional way of getting word counts -- through a collection or a dictionary -- is to track the number of texts in which a word occurs as well. This is a variation, almost an inversion, of TFIDF: we are looking for high frequency words and those words that also occur across a number of texts are more representative than those terms that occur in only one or a few. If there's a proper statistical way to do this, or term to call it, teach me!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus it's my hope that there is a way to count the number of non-zero entries for a word, such that we can sum its total frequency *and* its total text count. I'm imagining tallies that look like this. (Please note that these are made up.)\n",
