Time to crank up the `wget` engine. My list of URLs looks like this:

	https://www.ted.com/talks/laura_indolfi_good_news_in_the_fight_against_pancreatic_cancer
	https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_junger_our_lonely_society_makes_it_hard_to_come_home_from_war
	https://www.ted.com/talks/juno_mac_the_laws_that_sex_workers_really_want
	
(These are my test three.)

The URL for the transcript looks like this:

    https://www.ted.com/talks/juno_mac_the_laws_that_sex_workers_really_want/transcript

So it looks like we just need to add `/transcript` to the end of each line. In Textmate I used the Find functionality, with regex turned on, and replaced `\n` with `/trasnscript\n`. 

Now to test ... and there are three HTML files in the directory. 

Here's what a block of the transcript looks like:

	<!-- Transcript text -->
	<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
	<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

	<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
	<p>
	I&#39;m not like most of the people
	you&#39;ll have heard speaking
	about prostitution before.
	I&#39;m not a police officer
	or a social worker.
	I&#39;m not an academic,
	a journalist or a politician.
	And as you&#39;ll probably have
	picked up from Maryam&#39;s blurb,
	I&#39;m not a nun, either.
	</p>
	</div>
	</div>

The actual time mark isn't embedded in the HTML. Okay. It's probably just as well that we didn't keep that metadata in the current corpus. Duplicating it here would probably be impossible.

Thank you `wget`:
