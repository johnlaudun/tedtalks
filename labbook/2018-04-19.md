## Notes on Years

While the work on gendered differences in word usage has not been completed, I also made some notes on a possible way to deal with years. I should note upfront that this work assumes we will be doing topic modeling "later" -- quotation marks are used here because we did topic modeling right away and realized that we needed to understand the corpus more clearly before doing it "for real."

With that noted, it could be argued that a lot of work in the digital humanities begins and also ends with topic modeling -- or, before the arrival of LDA and MALLET, with principle component analysis. Topic modeling is compelling to humanists because it focuses on individual documents within a larger corpus, but in our rush to stay focused on texts, we miss the opportunity to understand other, perhaps broaders, trends that might reveal something about the nature of the texts in a collection. 

At the level of vocabulary, what words get used, in TED talks, it would be interested to know if there are frequencies available for other corpora against which we could compare frequencies in these texts. All we would need is a list of words and their relative frequency against which we could compare our list of words and their relative frequencies.

Barring inter-corpora comparisons, there is also the possibility of making intra-corpora comparisons, dividing the texts into piles by, say, gender, as we already have. When I came across an implementation of  dynamic topic modeling in Python using NMF, I realized that much the same thing could be done by years, and, it might be something simple enough for me to do, since it doesn't need to be also broken down by text: we don't really care about texts, except, as was the case in the gendered frequencies, where a single text or small set of texts might unfairly affect results.
