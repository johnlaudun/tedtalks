I tried to handle grabbing data and then parsing it into a CSV entirely within Python, but I kept getting failures. After taking a day or two off to think it through, I decided simply to rely on the list of URLs included within the Google Sheet, which I used to generate two lists, each in its own file:


The two files would allow me to download the main page for a talk, which has the descriptions we need as well as then to download the transcripts for the talks. With the two lists being in the same order, the two CSVs generated should be merge-able. 

This morning I initiated the download of the transcripts into their own directory:

	tedtemp % ls
	
	TED Talks as of 3.29.2018.csv 
	talks_xss.txt
	talks_main.txt                
	transcripts
	
	tedtemp % cd transcripts/
	
	transcripts % wget -w 2 -i ../talks_xss.txt

At the end of the process, `wget` reported:

	FINISHED --2018-06-14 11:29:44--
	Total wall clock time: 2h 4m 2s
	Downloaded: 2689 files, 224M in 34s (6.67 MB/s)

**Nota bene**: I to add /transcript to the end of each line in the list of URLs to download, I used regex and replaced `\n` with `/transcript\n`, which meant that the last line of the list, with no line after it, did not get appended. That's why there is the file `talks_xss_plus_one.txt` in the directory. I ran it from within the transcripts directory to add the file we needed:

	transcripts % wget -w 2 -i ../talks_xss_plus_one.txt 

In the mean time, I downloaded the main page which contains the various bits of metadata -- view counts, speaker description, talk description, etc.

	Total wall clock time: 1h 58m 49s
	Downloaded: 2749 files, 166M in 13s (12.7 MB/s)

While I was on the page, I realized that it would be possible to download the comments associated with each page because the URL is a suffix:

	https://www.ted.com/talks/ze_frank_s_nerdcore_comedy/discussion

And here's the report:
