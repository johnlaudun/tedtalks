"The authors reported gender differences in 35 word categories, although most effect sizes were small by conventional standards (|d| .20; [14]). Men used more articles (e.g., “a”, “an”, “the”), quantifiers (e.g. “few” “many” “much”), and spatial words (e.g., “above”, “over”), were more likely to swear, and were more likely to discuss money- and occupational- related topics. Women used more personal pronouns, intensive adverbs (e.g., “really”, “very”, “so”), and emotion words, and were more likely to discuss family and social life. The differ- ences were interpreted as reflecting a male tendency towards objects and impersonal topics and a female tendency towards psychological and social processes." (2)

"In Study 1, we generated thousands of topics, and compared their relative use in a sample of over 52,000 female and male participants. This identified hundreds of male and female-linked topics. In Study 2, we labeled these gender-linked topics by degree of assertive- ness and affiliation in a sample of over 15,000 people, and compared the pattern of gender- linked language along these two dimensions." (5)

This seems like a standard description of **LDA**: "LDA assumes that topics are mixtures of words and that documents (in this case, status updates) are mixtures of a fixed number of latent topics, which is specified by the analyst in advance. When applied to a set of messages, LDA identifies the words that define each topic along with their probability of occurring in the topic (i.e., a weight). Heavily weighted words are more prevalent within a given topic than less weighted words." (5)

"Lastly, we estimated the size of gender differences for all 1,281 topics using Cohen’s d, the standardized difference in group means, and 95% confidence intervals."

Our open-vocabulary method revealed hundreds of gender-linked language topics. While most of the effect sizes were relatively small by conventional standards, each topic represents a dimension of the broader construct of language. Across hundreds of dimensions, these small differences can add up to create meaningful stylistic differences across gender.
