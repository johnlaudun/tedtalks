aaron_huey,1826,1828,Aaron Huey 2010,Aaron Huey,male,America's native prisoners of war,Nov 2010,911,I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota. Many of you may have heard of the Lakota  or at least the larger group of tribes called the Sioux. The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps now called reservations. The Pine Ridge Reservation  the subject of today's slide show  is located about    miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota. It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number      and it is where the Lakota now live. Now  if any of you have ever heard of AIM  the American Indian Movement  or of Russell Means  or Leonard Peltier  or of the stand off at Oglala  then you know that Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the U.S. So I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota  and that's a very difficult one for me. Because  if you haven't noticed from my skin color  I'm white  and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation. You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today  and I've become very close with them  and they've welcomed me like family. They've called me  brother  and  uncle  and invited me again and again over five years. But on Pine Ridge  I will always be what is called  wasichu   and  wasichu  is a Lakota word that means  non Indian   but another version of this word means  the one who takes the best meat for himself.  And that's what I want to focus on    the one who takes the best part of the meat. It means greedy. So take a look around this auditorium today. We are at a private school in the American West  sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets. And if we look at our lives  we have indeed taken the best part of the meat. So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain  and know that when you see these people's faces that these are not just images of the Lakota  they stand for all indigenous people. On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family. The following is a time line of treaties made  treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles. I'll begin in     . What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department  setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans.       The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made  clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation. According to the treaty  those lands are a sovereign nation. If the boundaries of this treaty had held    and there is a legal basis that they should    then this is what the U.S. would look like today.    years later  the Homestead Act  signed by President Lincoln  unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands.       An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of    Sioux men  the largest mass execution in U.S. history. The execution was ordered by President Lincoln only two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation.       the beginning of the transcontinental railroad    a new era. We appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation. The treaties were out the window. In response  three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the U.S. army many times over. I want to repeat that part. The Lakota defeat the U.S. army.       The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills. The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states. We promise that the Powder River country will henceforth be closed to all whites. The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux. In fact  this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy.       The transcontinental railroad was completed. It began carrying  among other things  a large number of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo  eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the Sioux.       The Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government. In addition  the military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations. All western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war. Also in       we ended the time of treaty making. The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations  and we can't have that. We had plans.       General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory  specifically the Black Hills. The news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into Lakota Nation. Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible.       The Lakota war begins over the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty.       On July   th on its way to attack a Lakota village  Custer's  th Cavalry was crushed at the battle of Little Big Horn.       The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson. He was later killed while in custody.      is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties. A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as  sell or starve   Sign the paper  or no food for your tribe. Only    percent of the adult male population signed. The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three quarters of the tribe to sign away land. That clause was obviously ignored.       The Dawes Act. Communal ownership of reservation lands ends. Reservations are cut up into     acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of. Tribes lost millions of acres. The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left. The move destroyed the reservations  making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation. Most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers. Once again  the fat of the land goes to wasichu.       a date I believe to be the most important in this slide show. This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre. On December   th  U.S. troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek and massacred Chief Big Foot and     prisoners of war  using a new rapid fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a Hotchkiss gun. For this so called  battle      Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the  th Cavalry. To this day  this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle. More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One  World War Two  Korea  Vietnam  Iraq or Afghanistan. The Wounded Knee massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars. Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee  I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux  but as a grave for all indigenous peoples. The holy man  Black Elk  said   I did not know then how much was ended. When I look back now from this high hill of my old age  I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard  A people's dream died there  and it was a beautiful dream.  With this event  a new era in Native American history began. Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after. Because it was in this moment with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns that the U.S. government openly declared its position on Native rights. They were tired of treaties. They were tired of sacred hills. They were tired of ghost dances. And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux. So they brought out their cannons.  You want to be an Indian now   they said  finger on the trigger.       the U.S. Indian population reached its low point    less than          compared to an estimated eight million in     . Fast forward.       The longest running court case in U.S. history  the Sioux Nation v. the United States  was ruled upon by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court determined that  when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders  the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated. The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken and that the initial offering price plus interest should be paid to the Sioux Nation. As payment for the Black Hills  the court awarded only     million dollars to the Sioux Nation. The Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry   The Black Hills are not for sale.        Statistics about Native population today  more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee  reveal the legacy of colonization  forced migration and treaty violations. Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between    and    percent. The housing office is unable to build new structures  and existing structures are falling apart. Many are homeless  and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families.    percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity. At least    percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold. More than    percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line. The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately eight times higher than the U.S. national average. The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the U.S. national average. Cervical cancer is five times higher than the U.S. national average. School dropout rate is up to    percent. Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the U.S. national average. Frequently  grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents  due to alcoholism  domestic violence and general apathy  cannot raise them.    percent of the population over the age of    suffers from diabetes. The life expectancy for men is between    and    years old    roughly the same as in Afghanistan and Somalia. The last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say   My God  what are these people doing to themselves  They're killing each other. They're killing themselves while we watch them die.  This is how we came to own these United States. This is the legacy of manifest destiny. Prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps long after the guards are gone. These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken. A long time ago  a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me  by wasichu  eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills. Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end. As removed as we the dominant society may feel from a massacre in       or a series of broken treaties     years ago  I still have to ask you the question  how should you feel about the statistics of today  What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you  And how much of this history do you need to own  even  Is any of this your responsibility today  I have been told that there must be something we can do. There must be some call to action. Because for so long I've been standing on the sidelines content to be a witness  just taking photographs. Because the solution seems so far in the past  I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them. The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix. It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti  or ending AIDS  or fighting a famine. The  fix   as it's called  may be much more difficult for the dominant society than  say  a     check or a church trip to paint some graffiti covered houses  or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore. So where does that leave us  Shrugging our shoulders in the dark  The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the      and      Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota. The call to action I offer today    my TED wish    is this  Honor the treaties. Give back the Black Hills. It's not your business what they do with them.,Photographer,201011,5.53394477318,1404833,TEDxDU 2010,2010-09-19,20100919
aaron_koblin,1969,1971,Aaron Koblin 2011,Aaron Koblin,male,Visualizing ourselves ... with crowd-sourced data,May 2011,1083,So I think data can actually make us more human. We're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives  and it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories. Recently  a wise media theorist Tweeted   The   th century culture was defined by the novel  the   th century culture was defined by the cinema  and the culture of the   st century will be defined by the interface.  And I believe this is going to prove true. Our lives are being driven by data  and the presentation of that data is an opportunity for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories. So I'm going to show you a few of the projects that I've been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems. This is a project called Flight Patterns. What you're looking at is airplane traffic over North America for a    hour period. As you see  everything starts to fade to black  and you see people going to sleep. Followed by that  you see on the West coast planes moving across  the red eye flights to the East coast. And you'll see everybody waking up on the East coast  followed by European flights coming in the upper right hand corner. Everybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast. You see San Francisco and Los Angeles start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left hand corner. I think it's one thing to say there's         planes being monitored by the federal government at any one time  and it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows. This is a time lapse image of that exact same data  but I've color coded it by type  so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us. And I started making these  and I put them into Google Maps and allow you to zoom in and see individual airports and the patterns that are occurring there. So here we can see the white represents low altitudes  and the blue are higher altitudes. And you can zoom in. This is taking a look at Atlanta. You can see this is a major shipping airport  and there's all kinds of activity there. You can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer. See again  the diversity. And you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have. This is scrolling up the East coast. You can see some of the chaos that's happening in New York with the air traffic controllers having to deal with all those major airports next to each other. So zooming back out real quick  we see  again  the U.S.    you get Florida down in the right hand corner. Moving across to the West coast  you see San Francisco and Los Angeles    big low traffic zones across Nevada and Arizona. And that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom. I started taking a look as well at different perimeters  because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data. This is looking at ascending versus descending flights. And you can see  over time  the ways the airports change. You see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen. And you can see  eventually the airport actually flips directions. So this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT. This is visualizing international communications. So it's how New York communicates with other international cities. And we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition. And it had a live feed with a    hour offset  so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through AT T's data and revealing itself. This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab and CurrentCity.org. And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam. So you're seeing the daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city  until we approach New Year's Eve  where everybody says   Happy New Year   So this is an interactive tool that you can move around and see different parts of the city. This is looking at another event. This is called Queen's Day. So again  you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city. And then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the night before  which happens right here. And then you can see people celebrating the next day. And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases. So now on to something completely different. Some of you may recognize this. This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine. And it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well  except for one thing  it's not a robot at all. There's actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player. This was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon called the Mechanical Turk    named after this guy. And it's based on the premise that there are certain things that are easy for people  but really difficult for computers. So they made this web service and said   Any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people.  The nerdy side of me thought   Wow  this is amazing. I can tap into thousands of people's minds.  And the other nerdy side of me thought   This is horrible. This is completely bizarre. What does this mean for the future of mankind  where we're all plugged into this borg   I was probably being a little extreme. But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on  and we're just doing these little labors  So I created this drawing tool. I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left. And I said   I'll pay you two cents for your contribution.  And I started collecting sheep. And I collected a lot  a lot of different sheep. Lots of sheep. I took the first        sheep that I collected  and I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com where you can actually buy collections of    sheep. You can't pick individual sheep  but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity. And juxtaposed against this grid  you see actually  by rolling over each individual one  the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process. I think there's something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil    something we can all relate to  this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing. I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid. Kind of amazing what some people did. So here's a few statistics from the project. Approximate collection rate of    sheep per hour  which would make a working wage of    cents per hour. There were     rejected sheep that didn't meet  sheep like  criteria and were thrown out of the flock. The amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to    minutes. That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication. And there were       people that contributed to the project  or were unique IP addresses    so about how many people contributed. But only one of them out of the       said this. Which I was pretty surprised by. I expected people to be wondering   Why did I draw a sheep   And I think it's a pretty valid question. And there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep. Sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts  the first to be selectively bred for production traits  the first animal to be cloned. Obviously  we think of sheep as followers. And there's this reference to  Le Petit Prince  where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep. He draws sheep after sheep. The narrator's only appeased when he draws a box. And he says   It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep. It's about your own interpretation and doing something different.  And I like that. So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's  Modern Times.  It's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes during the Industrial Revolution. So there were no longer shoe makers  but now there are people slapping soles on people's shoes. And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot. So I thought this was an interesting clip to divide into    pieces and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool. This basically allowed    what you see on the left side is the original frame  and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by    people who have no idea what it is they're doing. And this was the inspiration for a project that I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima. We decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for  which is making money. So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into        teeny pieces  and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk. We asked people to draw what it was that they saw. But here there was no sheep like criteria. People  if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face  it actually made it into the bill. So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do. So we took these hundred dollar bills  and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com  where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions. And you can also trade real hundred dollar bills for fake hundred dollar bills and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project  which is now known as One Laptop Per Child. This is again showing all the different contributions. You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings  like this one on top    spent a long time making realistic versions. And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces. Here on the right hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing     .      Really   That's all I'm getting paid for this  So the last Mechanical Turk project I'm going to talk to you about is called Bicycle Built for     . This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey. You may recognize these two guys. This is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the '  s  where they created the song  Daisy Bell   which was the world's first singing computer. You may recognize it from        A Space Odyssey.  When HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song  as a reference to when computers became human. So we resynthesized this song. This is what that sounded like. We broke down all the individual notes in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing. Daisy Bell    Daisy  Daisy ...   Aaron Koblin  And we took all of those individual pieces  and we fed them into another Turk request. This is what it would look like if you went to the site. You type in your code  but you first test your mic. You'd be fed a simple audio clip. And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice. After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted  you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context. And this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions. Recording    Daisy  Daisy     give me your answer do     I'm half crazy     all for the love of you     It can't be a stylish marriage     I can't afford a carriage     But you'll look sweet upon the seat     of a bicycle built for two   AK  So James Surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds  that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual. We wanted to see how this applies to collaborative  distributed music making  where nobody has any idea what it is they're working on. So if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together. I'm sorry for this. Chorus    Daisy  Daisy     Give me your answer do     I'm half crazy     all for the love of you     It can't be a stylish marriage     I can't afford a carriage     But you'd look sweet upon the seat     of a bicycle built for two   AK  So stepping back for a quick second  when I was at UCLA going to grad school  I was also working at a place called the Center for Embedded Network Sensing. And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners. So basically motion through  D space. And this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost who said   Wait a minute. You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video   So we did exactly that. We made a music video for one of my favorite bands  Radiohead. And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers  but we also open sourced it  and we made it released as a Google Code project  where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it. And people were making some amazing things. This is actually two of my favorites  the pin board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke. A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content. More recently  somebody even  D printed Thom Yorke's head  which is a little creepy  but pretty cool. So with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on  I was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something. And I met a music video director named Chris Milk. And we started bouncing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project. But we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for. So we put the idea on the back burner for a few months. And he ended up talking to Rick Rubin  who was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album called  Ain't No Grave.  The lyrics to the leading track are  Ain't no grave can hold my body down.  So we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash. So I teamed up with my good friend Ricardo Cabello  also known as Mr. doob  who's a much better programmer than I am  and he made this amazing Flash drawing tool. As you know  an animation is a series of images. So what we did was cross cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash  and at eight frames a second  we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically changing music video. So I don't have time to play the entire thing for you  but I want to show you two short clips. One is the beginning of the music video. And that's going to be followed by a short clip of people who have already contributed to the project talking about it briefly.   can hold my body down     There ain't no grave     can hold body down     When I hear the trumpet sound     I'm going to ride right out of the ground     Ain't no grave     can hold my body ...   AK  What better way to pay tribute to the man than to make something for one of his songs. Collaborator  I felt really sad when he died. And I just thought it'd be wonderful  it'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory. Collaborator Two  It really allows this last recording of his to be a living  breathing memorial. Collaborator Three  For all of the frames to be drawn by fans  each individual frame  it's got a very powerful feeling to it. Collaborator Four  I've seen everybody from Japan  Venezuela  to the States  to Knoxville  Tennessee. Collaborator Five  As much as is different from frame to frame  it really is personal. Collaborator Six  Watching the video in my room  I could see me not understanding at the beginning of it. And I just worked and worked through problems  until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves. You can actually see the point when I know what I'm doing  and a lot of light and dark comes into it. And in a weird way  that's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well. It's the sum total of his life  all the things that had happened    the bad things  the good things. You're hearing a person's life. AK  So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com  what you'll see is the video playing above. And below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project. So this isn't finished at all  but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate. If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails  you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located. And if you find one that you're interested in  you can actually click on it and open up an information panel where you're able to rate that frame  which helps it bubble up to the top. And you can also see the way that it was drawn. Again  you can get the playback and personal contribution. In addition to that  it's listed  the artist's name  the location  how long they spent drawing it. And you can pick a style. So this one was tagged  Abstract.  But there's a bunch of different styles. And you can sort the video a number of different ways. You can say   I want to see the pointillist version or the sketchy version or the realistic version. And then this is  again  the abstract version  which ends up getting a little bit crazy. So the last project I want to talk to you about is another collaboration with Chris Milk. And this is called  The Wilderness Downtown.  It's an online music video for the Arcade Fire. Chris and I were really amazed by the potential now with modern web browsers  where you have HTML  audio and video and the power of JavaScript to render amazingly fast. And we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web beyond the four by three or sixteen by nine window and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen. But most importantly  I think  we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project  where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone. What if we had a very low commitment  but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed  So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up. And you type in the address    it actually creates a music video specifically for you  pulling in Google maps and Streetview images into the experience itself. So this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address  but I'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect.   Now our lives are changing fast     Hope that something pure can last     Hope that something pure can last     Ooh we used to wait     Ooh we used to wait     Ooh we used to wait     Sometimes it never came     Sometimes it never came     Still moving through the pain     We used to wait for it     We used to wait for it     We used to wait for it   AK  So I think  if there's one thing to take away from my talk today  it's that an interface can be a powerful narrative device. And as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data  we have an opportunity  and maybe even an obligation  to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories as we explore and collaborate together. Thanks a lot.,Data artist,201105,6.1500120919,1503044,TED2011,2011-03-02,20110302
adam_grosser_and_his_sustainable_fridge,1249,1251,Adam Grosser 2008,Adam Grosser,male,A mobile fridge for vaccines,Jun 2008,201,This is a work in process  based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine.  .  billion people don't have access to electricity  refrigeration or stored fuels. This is a problem. It impacts  the spread of disease  the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life. So here's the plan  inexpensive refrigeration that doesn't use electricity  propane  gas  kerosene or consumables. Time for some thermodynamics. And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator. Adam Grosser  So    years ago  I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration. It's one of those things that stuck in my head. It was a lot like the Stirling engine  it was cool  but you didn't know what to do with it. And it was invented in       by this guy Ferdinand Carre  but he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time. This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in       and it was a really neat idea  and I'll get to why it didn't work  but here's how it works. There's two spheres and they're separated in distance. One has a working fluid  water and ammonia  and the other is a condenser. You heat up one side  the hot side. The ammonia evaporates and it re condenses in the other side. You let it cool to room temperature  and then  as the ammonia re evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side  it creates a powerful cooling effect. So  it was a great idea that didn't work at all  it blew up. Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong. It topped     psi. The ammonia was toxic. It sprayed everywhere. But it was kind of an interesting thought. So  the great thing about      is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do. So  we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved    a lot of computational fluid dynamics. We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong. We found some non toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures. Brought in a team from the U.K.    there's a lot of great refrigeration people  it turned out  in the U.K.    and built a test rig  and proved that  in fact  we could make a low pressure  non toxic refrigerator. So  this is the way it works. You put it on a cooking fire. Most people have cooking fires in the world  whether it's camel dung or wood. It heats up for about    minutes  cools for an hour. Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for    hours. It looks like this. This is the fifth prototype. It's not quite done. Weighs about eight pounds  and this is the way it works. You put it into a    liter vessel  about three gallons  and it'll cool it down to just above freezing    three degrees above freezing    for    hours in a    degree C environment. It's really cheap. We think we can build these in high volumes for about    dollars  in low volumes for about    dollars. And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have.

adora_svitak,1669,1671,Adora Svitak 2010,Adora Svitak,female,What adults can learn from kids,Apr 2010,479,Now  I want to start with a question  When was the last time you were called  childish   For kids like me  being called childish can be a frequent occurrence. Every time we make irrational demands  exhibit irresponsible behavior  or display any other signs of being normal American citizens  we are called childish. Which really bothers me. After all  take a look at these events  Imperialism and colonization  world wars  George W. Bush. Ask yourself  who's responsible  Adults. Now  what have kids done  Well  Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust. Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States. And  most recently  Charlie Simpson helped to raise         pounds for Haiti  on his little bike. So as you can see evidenced by such examples  age has absolutely nothing to do with it. The traits the word  childish  addresses are seen so often in adults  that we should abolish this age discriminatory word  when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking. Thank you. Then again  who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs  Maybe you've had grand plans before  but stopped yourself  thinking   That's impossible   or  That costs too much   or  That won't benefit me.  For better or worse  we kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things. Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking  like my wish that no one went hungry  or that everything were free  a kind of utopia. How many of you still dream like that  and believe in the possibilities  Sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of Utopian ideals can be a burden  because you know that if everything were free  then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos. On the other hand  we kids still dream about perfection. And that's a good thing  because in order to make anything a reality  you have to dream about it first. In many ways  our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility. For instance  the Museum of Glass in Tacoma  Washington  my home state    yoohoo  Washington  has a program called Kids Design Glass  and kids draw their own ideas for glass art. The resident artist said they got some of their best ideas from the program  because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes  they just think of good ideas. Now  when you think of glass  you might think of colorful Chihuly designs  or maybe Italian vases  but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that  into the realm of brokenhearted snakes and bacon boys  who you can see has meat vision. Now  our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insider's knowledge. Kids already do a lot of learning from adults  and we have a lot to share. I think that adults should start learning from kids. Now  I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd    teachers and students  and I like this analogy  It shouldn't be a teacher at the head of the class  telling students   Do this  do that.  The students should teach their teachers. Learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal. The reality  unfortunately  is a little different  and it has a lot to do with trust  or a lack of it. Now  if you don't trust someone  you place restrictions on them  right  If I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the    percent interest I established on her last loan  I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me  until she pays it back. True story  by the way. Now  adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids  from every  Don't do that  don't do this  in the school handbook  to restrictions on school Internet use. As history points out  regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control. And although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes  kids have no or very little say in making the rules  when really  the attitude should be reciprocal  meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population. Now  what's even worse than restriction  is that adults often underestimate kids' abilities. We love challenges  but when expectations are low  trust me  we will sink to them. My own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister. Okay  so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that  but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters  when lots of other kids were hearing  The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round.  Well  we heard that one too  but  Pioneer Germ Fighters  totally rules. I loved to write from the age of four  and when I was six  my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word. Thank you  Bill Gates  and thank you  Ma. I wrote over     short stories on that little laptop  and I wanted to get published. Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published  or saying wait until you're older  my parents were really supportive. Many publishers were not quite so encouraging. One large children's publisher ironically said that they didn't work with children. Children's publisher not working with children  I don't know  you're kind of alienating a large client there. One publisher  Action Publishing  was willing to take that leap and trust me  and to listen to what I had to say. They published my first book   Flying Fingers   you see it here. And from there on  it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools  keynoting to thousands of educators  and finally  today  speaking to you. I appreciate your attention today  because to show that you truly care  you listen. But there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults. Kids grow up and become adults just like you. Or just like you  Really  The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult  but rather  better adults than you have been  which may be a little challenging  considering your guys' credentials. But the way progress happens  is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones. It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore. No matter your position or place in life  it is imperative to create opportunities for children  so that we can grow up to blow you away. Adults and fellow TEDsters  you need to listen and learn from kids  and trust us and expect more from us. You must lend an ear today  because we are the leaders of tomorrow  which means we're going to take care of you when you're old and senile. No  just kidding. No  really  we are going to be the next generation  the ones who will bring this world forward. And in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you  remember that cloning is possible  and that involves going through childhood again  in which case you'll want to be heard  just like my generation. Now  the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas. Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed. Are you ready to make the match  Because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom. Thank you. Thank you.

al_seckel_says_our_brains_are_mis_wired,1879,1881,Al Seckel 2007,Al Seckel,male,Visual illusions that show how we (mis)think,Apr 2007,778,We're going to talk    my    a new lecture  just for TED    and I'm going show you some illusions that we've created for TED  and I'm going to try to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking about with happiness is  what gives happiness    or happiness  which I equate with joy in my particular area  and I think there's something very fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected twist    something that you didn't expect    and you find a joyful experience. You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what you'd expect. And there's something joyful about it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things. So  what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I mean  sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant  but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way  in a very primal way  so I can make the audience here happy. So I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations. First of all  I want to show you the particular illusion here. I want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience. I want you to see how this illusion is constructed  and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out. Now watch  as it rotates back  how quickly your perception snaps. OK now. Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very bright audience  all right  See if you can stop it from happening  even though you know     percent it's true that    bam  You can't undo it. What does that tell you about yourselves  We're going to do it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop it from happening. No. It's difficult. And we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation  about shape  about color and so forth and it's very primal. And it's an interesting question to ponder  why these things    we find these things joyful. Why would we find them joyful  So  here's something that Lionel did a while ago. I like these sort of little things like this. Again  this is not an optical trick. This is what you would see. In other words  it's not a camera cut. It's a perceptual trick. OK. We can violate your expectations about shape. We can violate your expectations on representation    what an image represents. What do you see here  How many of you here see dolphins  Raise your hand if you see dolphins. OK  those people who raised their hands  afterwards  the rest of the audience  go talk to them  all right  Actually  this is the best example of priming by experience that I know. If you are a child under the age of    who haven't been ruined yet  you will look at this image and see dolphins. Now  some of you adults here are saying   What dolphins  What dolphins   But in fact  if you reversed the figure ground    in other words  the dark areas here    I forgot to ask for a pointer    but if you reverse it  you'll see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way  if you're also a student at CalTech    they also tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on experience. Now  something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design  too. This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi  and they actually got away with this ad in Australia. So  if you look at this ad for beer  all those people are in sort of provocative positions. But they got it passed  and actually won the Clio awards  so it's funny how you can do these things. Remember that sort of  um. This is the joke I did when the Florida ballot was going around. You know  count the dots for Gore  count the dots for Bush  count 'em again ... You can violate your expectations about experience. Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine  but you can stop the water in drops and    actually make all the drops levitate. This is something we're building for  you know  amusement parks and that kind of stuff. Now let's take a static image. Can you see this  Do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up  It's completely static. It's a static image. How many people see this illusion  It's completely static. Right. Now  when    it's interesting that when we look at an image we see  you know  color  depth  texture. And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil. And it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn't respond. Now  you can make design mistakes. Like this building in New York. So that when you see it from this side  it looks like the balconies tilt up  and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down. So there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions. Or  you take this particular un retouched photograph. Now  interestingly enough  I get a lot of emails from people who say   Is there any perceptual difference between males and females   And I really say   No.  I mean  women can navigate through the world just as well as males can    and why wouldn't they  However  this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males  in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues. They can match the hat. Okay  now getting to a part    I want to show design in illusions. I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So that when you saw from one little angle was like this. And this little technique got popular in the   th century and the   th century to disguise hidden meanings  where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this. But these are early incorporations of illusions brought to    sort of high point with Hans Holbein's  Ambassadors.  And Hans Holbein worked for Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull. All right  now I'm going to show you some designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott Kim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions for TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one here on TED and happiness. OK now. Arthur  Ganson  hasn't talked yet  but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside. And so  we    Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur Ganson. Well  there's analog and digital. Thought that was appropriate here. And figure goes to ground. And for the musicians. And of course  since happiness    we want  joy to the world.  Now  another great designer    he's very well known in Japan    Shigeo Fukuda. And he just builds some fantastic things. This is simply amazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view it from one particular angle  you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano. Pianist transforms to violinist. This is really wild. This assemblage of forks  knives and spoons and various cutlery  welded together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn something in the sort of thing that I do  which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands. Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images  like creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells    un retouched seashells  but just by rearranging them. He did Einstein out of dice because  after all  Einstein said   God does not play dice with the universe.  Bert Herzog out of un retouched keyboards. Will Shortz  crossword puzzle. John Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil cabinets. Now  I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running  behind . I want to show you quickly what I've created  some new type of illusions. I've done something with taking the Pixar type illusions. So you see these kids the same size here  running down the hall. The two table tops of the same size. They're looking out two directions at once. You have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And that's something for you to think about  all right  So you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that  Which is impossible. You can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once. Now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape  They are. So  if you measured them  they would be. And as I say  those two figures are identical in size and shape. And it's interesting  by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion  how much stronger the illusions are. Any case  I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness  and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects  see me outside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things.,Master of visual illusions,200704,6.26031331593,2179841,TED2004,2004-02-26,20040226
alain_de_botton_atheism_2_0,58,60,Alain de Botton 2012,Alain de Botton,male,Atheism 2.0,Jan 2012,1148,One of the most common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don't    into the religious and the atheists. And for the last decade or so  it's been quite clear what being an atheist means. There have been some very vocal atheists who've pointed out  not just that religion is wrong  but that it's ridiculous. These people  many of whom have lived in North Oxford  have argued    they've argued that believing in God is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game. Now I think it's too easy. I think it's too easy to dismiss the whole of religion that way. And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel. And what I'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist    if you like  a new version of atheism we could call Atheism  . . Now what is Atheism  .   Well it starts from a very basic premise  of course  there's no God. Of course  there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels  etc. Now let's move on  that's not the end of the story  that's the very  very beginning. I'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines  that thinks   I can't believe in any of this stuff. I can't believe in the doctrines. I don't think these doctrines are right. But   a very important but   I love Christmas carols. I really like the art of Mantegna. I really like looking at old churches. I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament.  Whatever it may be  you know the kind of thing I'm talking about    people who are attracted to the ritualistic side  the moralistic  communal side of religion  but can't bear the doctrine. Until now  these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice. It's almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff  or you reject the doctrine and you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of CNN and Walmart. So that's a sort of tough choice. I don't think we have to make that choice. I think there is an alternative. I think there are ways    and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious    of stealing from religions. If you don't believe in a religion  there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing  with taking out the best sides of religion. And for me  atheism  .  is about both  as I say  a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying   What here could we use   The secular world is full of holes. We have secularized badly  I would argue. And a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well. And I'd like to run through a few of these today. I'd like to kick off by looking at education. Now education is a field the secular world really believes in. When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place  we think education  that's where we put a lot of money. Education is going to give us  not only commercial skills  industrial skills  it's also going to make us better people. You know the kind of thing a commencement address is  and graduation ceremonies  those lyrical claims that education  the process of education    particularly higher education    will make us into nobler and better human beings. That's a lovely idea. Interesting where it came from. In the early   th century  church attendance in Western Europe started sliding down very  very sharply  and people panicked. They asked themselves the following question. They said  where are people going to find the morality  where are they going to find guidance  and where are they going to find sources of consolation  And influential voices came up with one answer. They said culture. It's to culture that we should look for guidance  for consolation  for morality. Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare  the dialogues of Plato  the novels of Jane Austen. In there  we'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John. Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea. They wanted to replace scripture with culture. And that's a very plausible idea. It's also an idea that we have forgotten. If you went to a top university    let's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge    and you said   I've come here because I'm in search of morality  guidance and consolation  I want to know how to live   they would show you the way to the insane asylum. This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of. Why  They don't think we need it. They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance. They see us as adults  rational adults. What we need is information. We need data  we don't need help. Now religions start from a very different place indeed. All religions  all major religions  at various points call us children. And like children  they believe that we are in severe need of assistance. We're only just holding it together. Perhaps this is just me  maybe you. But anyway  we're only just holding it together. And we need help. Of course  we need help. And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning. You know  in the   th century in the U.K.  the greatest preacher  greatest religious preacher  was a man called John Wesley  who went up and down this country delivering sermons  advising people how they could live. He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents  the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich. He was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons  the classic medium of delivery of religions. Now we've given up with the idea of sermons. If you said to a modern liberal individualist   Hey  how about a sermon   they'd go   No  no. I don't need one of those. I'm an independent  individual person.  What's the difference between a sermon and our modern  secular mode of delivery  the lecture  Well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information. And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition. The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable  because we are in need of guidance  morality and consolation    and religions know that. Another point about education  we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once  they'll remember it. Sit them in a classroom  tell them about Plato at the age of     send them out for a career in management consultancy for    years  and that lesson will stick with them. Religions go   Nonsense. You need to keep repeating the lesson    times a day. So get on your knees and repeat it.  That's what all religions tell us   Get on you knees and repeat it    or    or    times a day.  Otherwise our minds are like sieves. So religions are cultures of repetition. They circle the great truths again and again and again. We associate repetition with boredom.  Give us the new   we're always saying.  The new is better than the old.  If I said to you   Okay  we're not going to have new TED. We're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true. We're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times because what she says is so clever   you'd feel cheated. Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset. The other things that religions do is to arrange time. All the major religions give us calendars. What is a calendar  A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas. In the Catholic chronology  Catholic calendar  at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor. You won't do that by accident  you will do that because you are guided to do that. Now we don't think that way. In the secular world we think   If an idea is important  I'll bump into it. I'll just come across it.  Nonsense  says the religious world view. Religious view says we need calendars  we need to structure time  we need to synchronize encounters. This comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings. Take the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon. You know  when you look at the Moon  you think   I'm really small. What are my problems   It sets things into perspective  etc.  etc. We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't. Why don't we  Well there's nothing to tell us   Look at the Moon.  But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September  you will be ordered out of your home  made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi  where you will be given poems to read in honor of the Moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of. You'll be handed rice cakes. And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart. That's very good. The other thing that religions are really aware of is  speak well    I'm not doing a very good job of this here    but oratory  oratory is absolutely key to religions. In the secular world  you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career. But the religious world doesn't think that way. What you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it. So if you go to an African American Pentecostalist church in the American South and you listen to how they talk  my goodness  they talk well. After every convincing point  people will go   Amen  amen  amen.  At the end of a really rousing paragraph  they'll all stand up  and they'll go   Thank you Jesus  thank you Christ  thank you Savior.  If we were doing it like they do it    let's not do it  but if we were to do it    I would tell you something like   Culture should replace scripture.  And you would go   Amen  amen  amen.  And at the end of my talk  you would all stand up and you would go   Thank you Plato  thank you Shakespeare  thank you Jane Austen.  And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going. All right  all right. We're getting there. We're getting there. The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains  we are also bodies. And when they teach us a lesson  they do it via the body. So for example  take the Jewish idea of forgiveness. Jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh. They don't just deliver us sermons on this. They don't just give us books or words about this. They tell us to have a bath. So in Orthodox Jewish communities  every Friday you go to a Mikveh. You immerse yourself in the water  and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea. We don't tend to do that. Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another. Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two. Let's look at art now. Now art is something that in the secular world  we think very highly of. We think art is really  really important. A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums  etc. We sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals  or our new churches. You've heard that saying. Now I think that the potential is there  but we've completely let ourselves down. And the reason we've let ourselves down is that we're not properly studying how religions handle art. The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art  The first idea is that art should be for art's sake    a ridiculous idea    an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world. I couldn't disagree more. The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself  that artists shouldn't say what they're up to  because if they said it  it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy. That's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum    let's admit it    is   I don't know what this is about.  But if we're serious people  we don't admit to that. But that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art. Now religions have a much saner attitude to art. They have no trouble telling us what art is about. Art is about two things in all the major faiths. Firstly  it's trying to remind you of what there is to love. And secondly  it's trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate. And that's what art is. Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith. So as you walk around a church  or a mosque or a cathedral  what you're trying to imbibe  what you're imbibing is  through your eyes  through your senses  truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind. Essentially it's propaganda. Rembrandt is a propagandist in the Christian view. Now the word  propaganda  sets off alarm bells. We think of Hitler  we think of Stalin. Don't  necessarily. Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something. And if that thing is good  there's no problem with it at all. My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions. And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum    if I was a museum curator  I would make a room for love  a room for generosity. All works of art are talking to us about things. And if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told  use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind  we would get a lot more out of art. Art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we've neglected because of certain mis founded ideas. Art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society. Art should be didactic. Let's think of something else. The people in the modern world  in the secular world  who are interested in matters of the spirit  in matters of the mind  in higher soul like concerns  tend to be isolated individuals. They're poets  they're philosophers  they're photographers  they're filmmakers. And they tend to be on their own. They're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable  single people. And they get depressed and they get sad on their own. And they don't really change much. Now think about religions  think about organized religions. What do organized religions do  They group together  they form institutions. And that has all sorts of advantages. First of all  scale  might. The Catholic Church pulled in    billion dollars last year according to the Wall Street Journal. These are massive machines. They're collaborative  they're branded  they're multinational  and they're highly disciplined. These are all very good qualities. We recognize them in relation to corporations. And corporations are very like religions in many ways  except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs. They're selling us shoes and cars. Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff    the therapists  the poets    are on their own and they have no power  they have no might. So religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind. Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us  but we can admire the institutional way in which they're doing it. Books alone  books written by lone individuals  are not going to change anything. We need to group together. If you want to change the world  you have to group together  you have to be collaborative. And that's what religions do. They are multinational  as I say  they are branded  they have a clear identity  so they don't get lost in a busy world. That's something we can learn from. I want to conclude. Really what I want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields  there is something to learn from the example of religion    even if you don't believe any of it. If you're involved in anything that's communal  that involves lots of people getting together  there are things for you in religion. If you're involved  say  in a travel industry in any way  look at pilgrimage. Look very closely at pilgrimage. We haven't begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we haven't looked at what religions do with travel. If you're in the art world  look at the example of what religions are doing with art. And if you're an educator in any way  again  look at how religions are spreading ideas. You may not agree with the ideas  but my goodness  they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so. So really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion  but at the end of the day  religions are so subtle  so complicated  so intelligent in many ways that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone  they're for all of us. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Now this is actually a courageous talk  because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters. AB  You can get shot by both sides. You can get shot by the hard headed atheists  and you can get shot by those who fully believe. CA  Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment. AB  Indeed. CA  But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from  which is this sense    that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious    of spiritual experience  of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are. Is there any room for that experience in Atheism  .   AB  Absolutely. I  like many of you  meet people who say things like   But isn't there something bigger than us  something else   And I say   Of course.  And they say   So aren't you sort of religious   And I go   No.  Why does that sense of mystery  that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe  need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling  Science and just observation gives us that feeling without it  so I don't feel the need. The universe is large and we are tiny  without the need for further religious superstructure. So one can have so called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit. CA  Actually  let me just ask a question. How many people here would say that religion is important to them  Is there an equivalent process by which there's a sort of bridge between what you're talking about and what you would say to them  AB  I would say that there are many  many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged. It's not as though  as I try to suggest  it's not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things  or you don't have religion and then you're cut off from all these very good things. It's so sad that we constantly say   I don't believe so I can't have community  so I'm cut off from morality  so I can't go on a pilgrimage.  One wants to say   Nonsense. Why not   And that's really the spirit of my talk. There's so much we can absorb. Atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion. CA  It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community who are atheists. But probably most people in the community certainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common. Are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where  instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war  that there could be bridging  AB  No  we need to be polite about differences. Politeness is a much overlooked virtue. It's seen as hypocrisy. But we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist and someone says   Well you know  I did pray the other day   you politely ignore it. You move on. Because you've agreed on    percent of things  because you have a shared view on so many things  and you politely differ. And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored. They've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement. CA  And finally  does this new thing that you're proposing that's not a religion but something else  does it need a leader  and are you volunteering to be the pope  AB  Well  one thing that we're all very suspicious of is individual leaders. It doesn't need it. What I've tried to lay out is a framework and I'm hoping that people can just fill it in. I've sketched a sort of broad framework. But wherever you are  as I say  if you're in the travel industry  do that travel bit. If you're in the communal industry  look at religion and do the communal bit. So it's a wiki project. CA  Alain  thank you for sparking many conversations later.,Philosopher,201201,6.04798786653,2264873,TEDGlobal 2011,2011-07-13,20110713
alan_russell_on_regenerating_our_bodies,195,197,Alan Russell 2007,Alan Russell,male,The potential of regenerative medicine,Jul 2007,1110,I'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope. When we go to the physician today    when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in  there are words that we just don't want to hear. There are words that we're truly afraid of. Diabetes  cancer  Parkinson's  Alzheimer's  heart failure  lung failure    things that we know are debilitating diseases  for which there's relatively little that can be done. And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease  why it's important  why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn't  and where we are clinically today  and where we might go tomorrow  and what some of the hurdles are. And we're going to do all of that in    minutes  I promise. I want to start with this slide  because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it. This was an issue from      that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human. It was basically a regenerative medicine issue. Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand. It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale. So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there. We know that if we have a damaged hip  you can put an artificial hip in. And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover. This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine. This is not regenerative medicine. Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago. The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like    and I'll come back to that theme a few times    instead of doing that  we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue. So that at the end of the treatment  you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment. Very few good ideas    if you agree that this is a good idea    very few good ideas are truly novel. And this is just the same. If you look back in history  Charles Lindbergh  who was better known for flying airplanes  was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel  one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller  to begin to think about  could you culture organs  And they published this book in       where they actually began to think about  what could you do in bio reactors to grow whole organs  We've come a long way since then. I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on. But before doing that  what I'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you. Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life  and reducing poverty  and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe. One of the challenges is that the richer we are  the longer we live. And the longer we live  the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older. This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of   . And you can basically see that the richer a country is  the older the people are within it. Why is this important  And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now  If the average age of your population is     then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again  maybe a little bit of asthma. If the average age in your country is    to     now the average person is looking at diabetes  early onset diabetes  heart failure  coronary artery disease    things that are inherently more difficult to treat  and much more expensive to treat. Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here. This is from  The Untied States of America.  In       there were    workers per retiree.    people who were basically outside of being really sick  paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease. In       two workers per retiree in the U.S. And this is matched in every industrialized  wealthy country in the world. How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this  This is age versus cost of health care. And you can see that right around age        to     there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care. It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies  you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care  plotted over your lifetime. And about seven years before you're about to die  there's a spike. And you can actually       we won't get into that. There are very few things  very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging. I'd suggest there are four things  and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system. All those things do is change who pays. They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is. One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care. We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing. You can prevent. Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention. But perhaps most interesting  to me anyway  and most important  is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression  and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom. Think of it in terms of diabetes  for instance. Today  with diabetes  what do we do  We diagnose the disease eventually  once it becomes symptomatic  and then we treat the symptom for                years. And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy. But eventually it stops working  and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease. Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease  perhaps even before it was symptomatic  And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it  but if it worked  we would truly be able to do something different. This video  I think  gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically. This is a newt re growing its limb. If a newt can do this kind of thing  why can't we  I'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment. But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body  for tissues and for organs themselves. So today's reality is that if we get sick  the message is we will treat your symptoms  and you need to adjust to a new way of life. I would pose to you that tomorrow    and when tomorrow is we could debate  but it's within the foreseeable future    we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation. There's a limb prosthetic up here  similar actually one on the soldier that's come back from Iraq. There are     soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs. Imagine if instead of facing that  they could actually face the regeneration of that limb. It's a wild concept. I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept. But it's applicable  again  to every organ system. How can we do that  The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body. We need to learn to speak the body's language. And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus. A mammalian fetus  if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy  will re grow that limb. So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound healing mechanisms. It's a natural process  but it is lost as we age. In a child  before the age of about six months  if they lose their fingertip in an accident  they'll re grow their fingertip. By the time they're five  they won't be able to do that anymore. So to engage in that conversation with the body  we need to speak the body's language. And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today. I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body. The first is cellular therapies. Clearly  we heal ourselves in a natural process  using cells to do most of the work. Therefore  if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body  they may do the healing. Secondly  we can use materials. We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials. If we can invent materials  design materials  or extract materials from a natural environment  then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself. And finally  we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal. I'm going to show you an example of each of these  and I'm going to start with materials. Steve Badylak    who's at the University of Pittsburgh    about a decade ago had a remarkable idea. And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig  if you threw away all the cells  and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active  may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself. And he asked a very important question. He asked the question  if I take that material  which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine  and I place it somewhere else on a person's body  would it give a tissue specific response  or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear  I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling. The picture I'm about to show you is a compelling picture. However  for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish    even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends    the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet  check your Blackberry  do anything other than look at the screen. What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer. And although    it's good to laugh before we look at this. This is the reality of diabetes. I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics  diabetic ulcers  we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment  which is amputation  if you can't heal it. So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long. This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic. The treatment for this is amputation. This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes  and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact. And this lady decided  after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer  that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented. That's what the wound looked like    weeks later. That material contained only natural signals. And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before. There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you    I'll let you know when you can look again. This is a horse. The horse is not in pain. If the horse was in pain  I wouldn't show you this slide. The horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident. Just a few weeks after treatment    in this case  taking that material  turning it into a gel  and packing that area  and then repeating the treatment a few times    and the horse heals up. And if you took an ultrasound of that area  it would look great. Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re attached. There are now         patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds. Could you regenerate a limb  DARPA just gave Steve    million dollars to lead an eight institution project to begin the process of asking that question. And I'll show you the    million dollar picture. This is a    year old man who's lost the end of his fingertip. Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips. After treatment that's what it looks like. This is happening today. This is clinically relevant today. There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches. But could you go a little further  Could you  say  instead of using material  can I take some cells along with the material  and remove a damaged piece of tissue  put a bio degradable material on there  You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish. This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital. He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish. He chills the dish  it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish. It's the coolest stuff. Now I'm going to show you cell based regeneration. And what I'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient. Again  if you're squeamish  you don't want to watch. But this one's kind of cool. So this is a bypass operation  just like what Al Gore had  with a difference. In this case  at the end of the bypass operation  you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient. And I'm standing up here because at one point I'm going to show you just how early this technology is. Here go the stem cells  right into the beating heart of the patient. And if you look really carefully  it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back flush. You see the cells coming back out. We need all sorts of new technology  new devices  to get the cells to the right place at the right time. Just a little bit of data  a tiny bit of data. This was a randomized trial. At this time this was an N of   . Now there's an N of about    . Basically  if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass  they get a little bit better. If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass  for these particular patients  they became asymptomatic. These are now two years out. The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early  and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state. This is the same procedure  but now done minimally invasively  with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure. There go the cells. We don't have time to go into all of those details  but basically  that works too. You can take patients who are less sick  and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy. Here's another example of stem cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet  but I think very soon will be. This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh  along with a number of colleagues around the world. They've decided that liposuction fluid  which    in the United States  we have a lot of liposuction fluid. It's a great source of stem cells. Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid. So you could go in  you could get your tummy tuck. Out comes the liposuction fluid  and in this case  the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons. All done in the lab. And I think fairly soon  you will see patients being treated with their own fat derived  or adipose derived  stem cells. I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease. Here's just one example before I close up. This is equally tragic. We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army  who have to treat the now        kids that have come back from Iraq. Many of those patients are very severely burned. And if there's anything that's been learned about burn  it's that we don't know how to treat it. Everything that is done to treat burn    basically we do a sodding approach. We make something over here  and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound  and we try and get the two to take. In this case here  a new  wearable bio reactor has been designed    it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR    by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh. And that bio reactor will lay down in the wound bed. The gun that you see there sprays cells. That's going to spray cells over that area. The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment  deliver other things as well at the same time  and therefore we will seed that lawn  as opposed to try the sodding approach. It's a completely different way of doing it. So my    minutes is up. So let me finish up with some good news  and maybe a little bit of bad news. The good news is that this is happening today. It's very powerful work. Clearly the images kind of get that across. It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter disciplinary. Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen. A number of governments  and a number of regions  have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease. The Japanese government were perhaps the first  when they decided to invest first   billion  later another   billion in this field. It's no coincidence. Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age. They need this to work or their health system dies. So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area. The European Union  same thing. China  the same thing. China just launched a national tissue engineering center. The first year budget was     million US dollars. In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach. Oh  for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president. We've had a different approach. And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along. But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way. And I'm going to finish up with a quote  maybe a little cheap shot  at the director of the NIH  who's a very charming man. Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago  to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that   .  billion dollars that he's going to get next year and focus it  in a strategic way  to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients. And at the end of a very testy meeting  what the NIH director said was   Your vision is larger than our appetite.  I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision  but together we can change his appetite. Thank you.,Medical futurist,200707,5.86070521862,1468307,TED2006,2006-02-02,20060202
alan_siegel_let_s_simplify_legal_jargon,1662,1664,Alan Siegel 2010,Alan Siegel,male,Let's simplify legal jargon!,Mar 2010,251,So  basically we have public leaders  public officials who are out of control  they are writing bills that are unintelligible  and out of these bills are going to come maybe        pages of regulations  total complexity  which has a dramatically negative impact on our life. If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits  if you're trying to get a small business loan  you face a blizzard of paperwork. What are we going to do about it  I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity  transparency and empathy  building humanity into communications. I've been simplifying things for    years. I come out of the advertising and design business. My focus is understanding you people  and how you interact with the government to get your benefits  how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with  and how you view brands. So  very quickly  when President Obama said   I don't see why we can't have a one page  plain English consumer credit agreement.  So  I locked myself in a room  figured out the content  organized the document  and wrote it in plain English. I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country. This is a real thing. Now  I went one step further and said   Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document  Let's go online.  And many people might need help in computation. Working with the Harvard Business School  you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment  If you spent    dollars for a meal  the longer you take to pay out that loan  you see  over a period of time using the minimum payment it's    dollars and    cents. How about that  Do you think your bank is going to show that to people  But it's going to work. It's more effective than just computational aids. And what about terms like  over the limit   Perhaps a stealth thing. Define it in context. Tell people what it means. When you put it in plain English  you almost force the institution to give the people a way  a default out of that  and not put themselves at risk. Plain English is about changing the content. And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM. It's a grid  it's a calendar. At such and such a date  IBM has responsibilities  you have responsibilities. Received very favorably by business. And there is some good news to report today. Each year  one in    taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS. There are     million letters that go out. Running through this typical letter that they had  I ran it through my simplicity lab  it's pretty unintelligible. All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible. We looked at doing over       letters that cover    percent of their transactions in plain English. They have been tested in the laboratory. When I run it through my lab  this heat mapping shows everything is intelligible. And the IRS has introduced the program. There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention. There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency  how to mandate simplicity. We see all this complexity. It's incumbent upon us  and this organization  I believe  to make clarity  transparency and empathy a national priority. There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate. There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible. So  how are we going to change the world  Make clarity  transparency and simplicity a national priority. I thank you.,"Executive, simplicity guru",201003,6.1125210084,895061,TED2010,2010-02-11,20100211
alessandra_orofino_it_s_our_city_let_s_fix_it,839,841,Alessandra Orofino 2014,Alessandra Orofino,female,It’s our city. Let’s fix it,Nov 2014,908,Fifty four percent of the world's population lives in our cities. In developing countries  one third of that population is living in slums. Seventy five percent of global energy consumption occurs in our cities  and    percent of gas emissions that cause global warming come from our cities. So things that you and I might think about as global problems  like climate change  the energy crisis or poverty  are really  in many ways  city problems. They will not be solved unless people who live in cities  like most of us  actually start doing a better job  because right now  we are  not doing a very good one. And that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of city life  first  our citizens' willingness to engage with democratic institutions  second  our cities' ability to really include all of their residents  and lastly  our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives. When it comes to engagement  the data is very clear. Voter turnout around the world peaked in the late '  s  and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before  and if those numbers are bad at the national level  at the level of our cities  they are just dismal. In the last two years  two of the world's most consolidated  oldest democracies  the U.S. and France  held nationwide municipal elections. In France  voter turnout hit a record low. Almost    percent of voters decided not to show up. In the U.S.  the numbers were even scarier. In some American cities  voter turnout was close to five percent. I'll let that sink in for a second. We're talking about democratic cities in which    percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders. The city of L.A.  a city of four million people  elected its mayor with just a bit over         votes. That was the lowest turnout the city had seen in     years. Right here  in my city of Rio  in spite of mandatory voting  almost    percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections. When it comes to inclusiveness  our cities are not the best cases of success either  and again  you don't need to look very far in order to find proof of that. The city of Rio is incredibly unequal. This is Leblon. Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood. And this is Complexo do Alem o. This is where over        of the city's poorest residents live. Leblon has an HDI  a Human Development Index  of .   . That is higher than Norway  Switzerland or Sweden. Complexo do Alem o has an HDI of .   . It sits somewhere in between the HDI of Algeria and Gabon. So Rio  like so many cities across the global South  is a place where you can go from northern Europe to sub Saharan Africa in the space of    minutes. If you drive  that is. If you take public transit  it's about two hours. And lastly  perhaps most importantly  cities  with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable  could be the ideal places for human happiness to flourish. We like being around people. We are social animals. Instead  countries where urbanization has already peaked seem to be the very countries in which cities have stopped making us happy. The United States population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the past three decades  and the main reason is this. The American way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many  many American cities  and as a result  they have seen a decline of relations  of the things that make us happy. Many studies show an increase in solitude and a decrease in solidarity  honesty  and social and civic participation. So how do we start building cities that make us care  Cities that value their most important asset  the incredible diversity of the people who live in them  Cities that make us happy  Well  I believe that if we want to change what our cities look like  then we really have to change the decision making processes that have given us the results  that we have right now. We need a participation revolution  and we need it fast. The idea of voting as our  only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore. People are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it's time to delegate that power to someone else. If the protests that swept Brazil in June      have taught us anything  it's that every time we try to exercise our power outside of an electoral context  we are beaten up  humiliated or arrested. And this needs to change  because when it does  not only will people re engage with the structures of representation  but also complement these structures with direct  effective  and  collective decision making  decision making of the kind that attacks inequality by its very inclusive nature  decision making of the kind that can change our cities into better places for us to live. But there is a catch  obviously  Enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare  and there's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role  by making it easier for people to organize  communicate and make decisions without having to be in the same room at the same time. Unfortunately for us  when it comes to fostering democratic processes  our city governments have not used technology to its full potential. So far  most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data on the city  potholes  fallen trees or broken lamps. They have also  to a lesser extent  invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them  just like my mom when I was eight and she told me that I had a choice  I had to be in bed by   p.m.  but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas. That's not participation  and in fact  governments have not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters   the way we allocate our budget  the way we occupy our land  and the way we manage our natural resources. Those are the kinds of decisions that can actually impact global problems that manifest themselves in our cities. The good news is  and I do have good news to share with you  we don't need to wait for governments to do this. I have reason to believe that it's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation. Three years ago  I cofounded an organization called Meu Rio  and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio to organize around causes and places that they care about in their own city  and have an impact on those causes and places every day. In these past three years  Meu Rio grew to a network of         citizens of Rio. About    percent of those  members are young people aged    to   . That is one in every    young people of that age in Rio today. Amongst our members is this adorable little girl  Bia  to your right  and Bia was just    years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition. Her school actually ranks among the best public schools in the country  and it was going to be demolished by the Rio de Janeiro state government to build  I kid you not  a parking lot for the World Cup right before the event happened. Bia started a campaign  and we even watched her school      through webcam monitoring  and many months afterwards  the government changed their minds. Bia's school stayed in place. There's also Jovita. She's an amazing woman whose daughter went missing about    years ago  and since then  she has been looking for her daughter. In that process  she found out that first  she was not alone. In the last year alone              people disappeared in the state of Rio. But she also found out that in spite of that  Rio had no centralized intelligence system for solving missing persons cases. In other Brazilian cities  those systems have helped solve up to    percent of missing persons cases. She started a campaign  and after the secretary of  security got        emails from people asking him to do this  he responded  and started to build a police unit specializing in those cases. It was open to the public at the end of last month  and Jovita was there giving interviews and being very fancy. And then  there is Leandro. Leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in Rio  and he created a recycling project in the slum. At the end of last year  December     he received an eviction order by the Rio de Janeiro state government giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years. The plan was to hand it over to a developer  who planned to turn it into a construction site. Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools  the Pressure Cooker  the same one that Bia and Jovita used  and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve. These stories make me happy  but not just because they have happy endings. They make me happy because they are happy beginnings. The teacher and parent community at Bia's school is looking for other ways they could improve that space even further. Leandro has ambitious plans to take his model to other low income communities in Rio  and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit that she helped created. Bia  Jovita and Leandro are living examples of something that citizens and city  governments around the world need to know  We are ready. As citizens  we are ready to decide on our common destinies  because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone  and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another  and we are ready to do this in cities around the world right now. With the Our Cities network  the Meu Rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities. We have already started doing it in S o Paulo with incredible results  and want to take it to cities around the world through a network of citizen centric  citizen led organizations that can inspire us  challenge us  and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives. It is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking lots  community driven recycling projects or construction sites  loneliness or solidarity  cars or buses  and it is our responsibility to do that now  for ourselves  for our families  for the people who make our lives worth living  and for the incredible creativity  beauty  and wonder that make our cities  in spite of all of their problems  the greatest invention of our time.

alessandro_acquisti_why_privacy_matters,560,562,Alessandro Acquisti 2013,Alessandro Acquisti,male,What will a future without secrets look like?,Oct 2013,888,I would like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving Adam and Eve  and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past    years. You know the incident. Adam and Eve one day in the Garden of Eden realize they are naked. They freak out. And the rest is history. Nowadays  Adam and Eve would probably act differently.   Adam Last nite was a blast  loved dat apple LOL    Eve yep.. babe  know what happened to my pants tho   We do reveal so much more information about ourselves online than ever before  and so much information about us is being collected by organizations. Now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information  or big data  but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy. And my story is about these tradeoffs. We start with an observation which  in my mind  has become clearer and clearer in the past few years  that any personal information can become sensitive information. Back in the year       about     billion photos were shot worldwide  but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online. In       only on Facebook  in a single month   .  billion photos were uploaded  most of them identified. In the same span of time  computers' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude. What happens when you combine these technologies together  increasing availability of facial data  improving facial recognizing ability by computers  but also cloud computing  which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three letter agencies  and ubiquitous computing  which allows my phone  which is not a supercomputer  to connect to the Internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds  Well  we conjecture that the result of this combination of technologies will be a radical change in our very notions of privacy and anonymity. To test that  we did an experiment on Carnegie Mellon University campus. We asked students who were walking by to participate in a study  and we took a shot with a webcam  and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop. While they were filling out the survey  we uploaded their shot to a cloud computing cluster  and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images which we had downloaded from Facebook profiles. By the time the subject reached the last page on the survey  the page had been dynamically updated with the    best matching photos which the recognizer had found  and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo. Do you see the subject  Well  the computer did  and in fact did so for one out of three subjects. So essentially  we can start from an anonymous face  offline or online  and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data. But a few years back  we did something else. We started from social media data  we combined it statistically with data from U.S. government social security  and we ended up predicting social security numbers  which in the United States are extremely sensitive information. Do you see where I'm going with this  So if you combine the two studies together  then the question becomes  can you start from a face and  using facial recognition  find a name and publicly available information about that name and that person  and from that publicly available information infer non publicly available information  much more sensitive ones which you link back to the face  And the answer is  yes  we can  and we did. Of course  the accuracy keeps getting worse.      of subjects' first   SSN digits identified  with   attempts   But in fact  we even decided to develop an iPhone app which uses the phone's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what I just described to you in real time  looking for a match  finding public information  trying to infer sensitive information  and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject  an example of augmented reality  probably a creepy example of augmented reality. In fact  we didn't develop the app to make it available  just as a proof of concept. In fact  take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme. Imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their Google Glasses or  one day  their contact lenses  and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you. What will this future without secrets look like  And should we care  We may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases  but in fact  having so much information doesn't mean that we will make decisions which are more objective. In another experiment  we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate. We included in this information some references to some funny  absolutely legal  but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online. Now interestingly  among our subjects  some had posted comparable information  and some had not. Which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly our subject  Paradoxically  it was the group who had posted similar information  an example of moral dissonance. Now you may be thinking  this does not apply to me  because I have nothing to hide. But in fact  privacy is not about having something negative to hide. Imagine that you are the H.R. director of a certain organization  and you receive r sum s  and you decide to find more information about the candidates. Therefore  you Google their names and in a certain universe  you find this information. Or in a parallel universe  you find this information. Do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview  If you think so  then you are not like the U.S. employers who are  in fact  part of our experiment  meaning we did exactly that. We created Facebook profiles  manipulating traits  then we started sending out r sum s to companies in the U.S.  and we detected  we monitored  whether they were searching for our candidates  and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media. And they were. Discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates. Now marketers like us to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor. But think again. Why should that be always the case  In a movie which came out a few years ago   Minority Report   a famous scene had Tom Cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him. Now  that movie is set in       about    years from now  and as exciting as that technology looks  it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you  and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect. So as an example  this is another experiment actually we are running  not yet completed. Imagine that an organization has access to your list of Facebook friends  and through some kind of algorithm they can detect the two friends that you like the most. And then they create  in real time  a facial composite of these two friends. Now studies prior to ours have shown that people don't recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites  but they react to those composites in a positive manner. So next time you are looking for a certain product  and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it  it will not be just a standard spokesperson. It will be one of your friends  and you will not even know that this is happening. Now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight. One of these mechanisms is transparency  telling people what you are going to do with their data. And in principle  that's a very good thing. It's necessary  but it is not sufficient. Transparency can be misdirected. You can tell people what you are going to do  and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information. So in yet another experiment  this one with students  we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior  including pretty sensitive questions  such as this one.  Have you ever cheated in an exam   Now to one group of subjects  we told them   Only other students will see your answers.  To another group of subjects  we told them   Students and faculty will see your answers.  Transparency. Notification. And sure enough  this worked  in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second. It makes sense  right  But then we added the misdirection. We repeated the experiment with the same two groups  this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions. How long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect of knowing that faculty would see your answers  Ten minutes  Five minutes  One minute  How about    seconds  Fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups disclose the same amount of information  as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers. Now I have to admit that this talk so far may sound exceedingly gloomy  but that is not my point. In fact  I want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives. The way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done  and certainly not the best way they can be done. When someone tells you   People don't care about privacy   consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy  and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself. When someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data  consider that in the last    years  researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy preserving manner. We can browse the Internet anonymously. We can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient  not even the NSA. We can have even privacy preserving data mining. In other words  we can have the benefits of big data while protecting privacy. Of course  these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects  which is why  perhaps  you don't hear more about them. Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden. There is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the Garden of Eden which doesn't have to do with the issue of Adam and Eve feeling naked and feeling ashamed. You can find echoes of this interpretation in John Milton's  Paradise Lost.  In the garden  Adam and Eve are materially content. They're happy. They are satisfied. However  they also lack knowledge and self awareness. The moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge  that's when they discover themselves. They become aware. They achieve autonomy. The price to pay  however  is leaving the garden. So privacy  in a way  is both the means and the price to pay for freedom. Again  marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them  but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us. We get free content. We get to play Angry Birds. We get targeted apps. But in fact  in a few years  organizations will know so much about us  they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them  and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them. Now there was one English author who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom for comfort. Even more so than George Orwell  the author is  of course  Aldous Huxley. In  Brave New World   he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing us. However  in the book  he also offers us a way out of that society  similar to the path that Adam and Eve had to follow to leave the garden. In the words of the Savage  regaining autonomy and freedom is possible  although the price to pay is steep. So I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information  the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom  rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us. Right now  many of us do not even know that the fight is going on  but it is  whether you like it or not. And at the risk of playing the serpent  I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here  the awareness of what is going on  and in your hands  just a few clicks away.

alex_kipman_the_dawn_of_the_age_of_holograms,1179,1181,Alex Kipman 2016,Alex Kipman,male,A futuristic vision of the age of holograms,Mar 2016,1141,Thousands of years from now  we'll look back at the first century of computing as a fascinating but very peculiar time    the only time in history where humans were reduced to live in  D space  interacting with technology as if we were machines  a singular      year period in the vastness of time where humans communicated  were entertained and managed their lives from behind a screen. Today  we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens. What happened to interacting with each other  I don't know about you  but I feel limited inside this  D world of monitors and pixels. And it is this very limitation and my desire to connect with people that inspires me as a creator. Put simply  I want to create a new reality  a reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other  a reality where people  not devices  are the center of everything. I dream of a reality where technology senses what we see  touch and feel  a reality where technology no longer gets in our way  but instead embraces who we are. I dream of technology on a human path. We have all experienced technology that enables people to act more like people  products that enable natural interactions  voice controls or biometrics. This is the next step in the evolution. This is Microsoft HoloLens  the first fully untethered holographic computer. Devices like this will bring  D holographic content right into our world  enhancing the way we experience life beyond our ordinary range of perceptions. Now  I'm not thinking about a distant future. I'm talking about today. We are already seeing car companies like Volvo designing cars differently with HoloLens  universities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn  and my personal favorite  NASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets holographically. Now  this is important. By bringing holograms into our world  I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer. I'm talking about freeing ourselves from the  D confines of traditional computing. Put it this way  temporally adjusted  we're like cave people in computer terms. We've barely discovered charcoal and started drawing the first stick figures in our cave. Now  this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day. And now for the next few minutes  I invite all of you to apply the same perspective to the journey ahead of us. Now  as I put this HoloLens on  let me explain the setup a little bit. It's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage with HoloLens  and I can't think of a better place to do it than here at TED. Momentarily  I am going to be seeing holograms right on this stage  just as clearly as I can see all of you. Now at the same time  we have also this special camera that just walked in onstage so that all of you can share in this experience with me up on all the monitors. So let's start our journey. And what better place to begin our journey  than in the computer cave of  D. Let's explore the world all around us with this new lens  and understand the computer world from a brand new perspective. The computer universe is both marvelous and primitive. It's a universe based on causality. As developers  we dream the different causes and then we program the different effects. Double click on an icon  that's a cause. Open an application  that's an effect. Now when we compare this to our physical universe  it is overly constraining  because our universe is not digital. Our universe is analog. Our universe doesn't think in terms of zero or one  true or false  or black or white. We exist in a world governed by quantum physics  a universe of zero and one both at the same time  a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray. You can see how these two worlds collide. So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life  We see screens from the moment we wake up  to the moment we fall asleep. Why  I think it's because computers give us superpowers. Within the digital universe  we have the power to displace space and the power to displace time. It doesn't matter if you're using technology for entertainment  productivity or communication. Think of it this way  let's all go home tonight and watch our favorite show on television. This is theater    time and space displaced. As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk  I'm going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle. That's displacement of space. Now  these are such great superpowers that we put up with the two dimensional limitations of our current digital world. But what if we didn't have to  What if we could have these same digital powers in our world  You can already see glimmers of this  but I believe our children's children will grow up in a world devoid of  D technology. It's remarkable to dream of this world  a world where technology truly understands us    where we live  work and communicate    with tools that enhance the human experience  not machines that limit our humanity. So how do we get there  For me  the answer required looking at the problem from a different perspective. It required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine. If you're a machine trying to sense our world  how would you actually break the problem down  You'd probably try to classify things as a human  an environment or an object. But how would that machine then interact with reality  And I can think of three ways. First  as a machine  I would observe or I would input reality. Speech recognition and biometric authentication are great examples of a machine interacting with humans from an input perspective. Secondly  as a machine  I could place digital information  or output information  into reality. Holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment from an output perspective. Finally  as a machine  I could exchange energy with the world via haptics. Now  imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object  or better yet  imagine pushing a hologram and having it push you back with equal force. With this perspective  we are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix. Now here's a secret  as an engineer  I get really excited anytime I can reduce something to the matrix. From self driving cars to smartphones to this holographic computer on my head  machines are becoming capable of understanding our world. And they are starting to interact with us in significantly more personal ways. Now  imagine having granular control over everything in the world. Move the dial one way  and you get reality. Move the dial the other way  and you get virtual reality. Now  imagine dialing your entire environment between virtual and real worlds. I love it down here. Now  imagine if I could look at all of you and dial from real humans into elves. When technology truly understands our world  it will again transform the ways we interact  the ways we work and the ways we play. Less than half a century ago  two courageous men landed on the moon  using computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets. Six hundred million humans watched them on grainy  black and white televisions. And the world  The world was mesmerized. Now imagine how our children and their children will experience the continued exploration of space with technology that understands this world. We already live in a world where real time universal translators exist. And I can squint  and I can already see holographic telepresence in our near future. In fact  since we've been lucky with our demo so far  let's try doing something else even more crazy. I invite you to experience  for the first time anywhere in the world  here on the TED stage  a real life holographic teleportation  between me and my friend  Dr. Jeffrey Norris  from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Finger crossed. Hi  Jeff. Jeff Norris  Hey  Alex. Alex Kipman  Phew  That worked. How are you doing today  Jeff  JN  Doing great. I had an awesome week. AK  So  can you tell us a little bit  Jeff  about where you are  JN  Well  I'm actually in three places. I'm standing in a room across the street  while I'm standing on this stage with you  while I'm standing on Mars  a hundred million miles away. AK  Wow  a hundred million miles away. This is crazy  Can you tell us a little bit more about where all this data from Mars is coming from  JN  Absolutely. This is a precise holographic replica of Mars  built from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover  that I can explore as easily as a place on Earth. Humans are natural explorers. We can instantly understand an environment  just by being present in it. We've built tools like our Mars Rover to extend our vision and lengthen our reach. But for decades  we've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards. Now  we're leaping over all of that  over the giant antennas and the relay satellites and the vastness between worlds to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there. Today  a group of scientists on our mission are seeing Mars as never before    an alien world made a little more familiar  because they're finally exploring it as humans should. But our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there. When we dial this real world to the virtual  we can do magical things. We can see in invisible wavelengths or teleport to the top of a mountain. Perhaps someday  we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it. We're taking the first steps. But we want the whole world to join us in taking the next  because this is not a journey for a few  but for all of us. AK  Thank you Jeff  this was amazing. Thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today. JN  Thank you Alex  bye bye. AK  Bye  Jeff. I dream about this future every single day. I take inspiration from our ancestors. We used to live in tribes where we interacted  communicated and worked together. We are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today    technology that will let us stop living inside this  D world of monitors and pixels  and let us start remembering what it feels like to live in our  D world. It's a phenomenal time to be human. Thank you. Helen Walters  Thanks so much. I have some questions. AK  OK. HW  So there's been some talk in the press. And I'll just ask you straight  then we have a straight answer. There's been talk about the difference between the demos and the reality of the commercial product. Talk about this field of view issue. Is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get  AK  It's a great question  Or  said better  this is a question we've been receiving in the media for possibly the last year. If you do your research  I haven't answered that question. I've purposely ignored it  because ultimately  it's the wrong question to ask. That's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the first time  and you then saying   What's the size of your television   The field of view for the product is almost irrelevant. What we should be talking about is the density of lights  or radiance  that shows up. Better said  what the angular resolution is of the things that you see. So from that perspective  what you saw    you know  the camera is wearing a HoloLens. So even if I wanted to cheat  I can't. HW  But the camera has a different lens on it than our eye. Right  AK  The camera has a fish eye lens on it. It's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is. So if you think about the points of light that show up radially from the vision of the camera  which is the thing that matters  how many points of light can I get in a given volume  That's the same as I get on this HoloLens as I will on that one. Now  this camera sees a much wider view of the world  right  HW  Jesus Christ  AK  He did show up  I told you he'd show up. Come this way. HW  Oh  shit. AK  And there's holographic Jeff Norris. HW  I knew something was happening  but I really wasn't sure what. AK  So in short  to be super crisp  the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view than the human eye. But the angular resolution of the holograms that you see  the points of light per unit of area  are actually the same. HW  So you spent    Jeff  I'll get to you in a minute    so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage    AK  That's right. HW  So help me out here  if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home  I don't need to map my apartment  right  AK  The HoloLens maps in real time at about five frames per second  with this technology that we call spatial mapping. So in your home  as soon as you put it on  holograms will start showing up  and you'll start placing them and they'll start learning your home. In a stage environment where we're trying to get something on my head to communicate with something over there with all of the wireless connectivity that usually brings all conferences down  we don't take the risk of trying to do this live. So what we do is pre map the stage at five frames per second with the same spatial mapping technology that you'll use with the product at home  and then we store it  so that when there's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this  between the camera's HoloLens and the one on my head  we don't have things disappear. Because ultimately  the holograms are coming from this HoloLens  and that one is just viewing the HoloLens. So if I lose connectivity  you would stop seeing beautiful things on the screen. HW  And it was beautiful. Um ... Jeff  JN  Yes  HW  Hi. AK  I'll take a step back. HW  So Jeff  you were on Mars  you were here  you were in a room across the street. Tell me more about the fact that  with holograms  you have sight but you don't have touch  you don't have smell. Is this scientifically useful now  That's my question for a hologram. JN  Thanks for the question. Absolutely  I believe that these technologies are scientifically useful right now  and that's why we're using them in multiple parts of our work at NASA.

alex_tabarrok_foresees_economic_growth,1452,1454,Alex Tabarrok 2009,Alex Tabarrok,male,How ideas trump crises,Apr 2009,791,The first half of the   th century was an absolute disaster in human affairs  a cataclysm. We had the First World War  the Great Depression  the Second World War and the rise of the communist nations. And each one of these forces split the world  tore the world apart  divided the world. And they threw up walls    political walls  trade walls  transportation walls  communication walls  iron curtains    which divided peoples and nations. It was only in the second half of the   th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss. Trade walls began to come tumbling down. Here are some data on tariffs  starting at    percent  coming down to less than   percent. We globalized the world. And what does that mean  It means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries  we made the world more cooperative. Transportation walls came tumbling down. You know in      the typical ship carried       to        tons worth of goods. Today a container ship can carry         tons  it can be manned with a smaller crew  and unloaded faster than ever before. Communication walls  I don't have to tell you    the Internet    have come tumbling down. And of course the iron curtains  political walls have come tumbling down. Now all of this has been tremendous for the world. Trade has increased. Here is just a little bit of data. In       exports from China to the United States     billion dollars. By       over     billion dollars. And perhaps most remarkably  at the beginning of the   st century  really for the first time in modern history  growth extended to almost all parts of the world. So China  I've already mentioned  beginning around       around the time of the death of Mao  growth    ten percent a year. Year after year after year  absolutely incredible. Never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in China. China is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades. India  starting a little bit later  but in       begetting tremendous growth. Incomes at that time less than        per year. And over the next    years have almost tripled. Growth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible. Now Africa  Sub Saharan Africa    Sub Saharan Africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth. And we can see the tragedy of Africa in the first few bars here. Growth was negative. People were actually getting poorer than their parents  and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been. But at the end of the   th century  the beginning of the   st century  we saw growth in Africa. And I think  as you'll see  there's reasons for optimism  because I believe that the best is yet to come. Now why. On the cutting edge today it's new ideas which are driving growth. And by that I mean it's products for which the research and development costs are really high  and the manufacturing costs are low. More than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge. Now ideas have this amazing property. Thomas Jefferson  I think  really expressed this quite well. He said   He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself  without lessening mine. As he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me.  Or to put it slightly differently  one apple feeds one man  but an idea can feed the world. Now this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters. This is practically the model of TED. But what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before. This provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important  more powerful than ever before  and are going to increase growth more than ever before. And to explain why this is so  I have a question. Suppose that there are two diseases  one of them is rare  the other one is common  but if they are not treated they are equally severe. If you had to choose  which would you rather have  the common disease or the rare disease  Common  the common    I think that's absolutely right  and why  Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases. The reason for this is incentives. It costs about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats       people          people  or a million people. But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people. So the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people. To put this differently  larger markets save lives. In this case misery truly does love company. Now think about the following  if China and India were as rich as the United States is today  the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now. Now we are not there yet  but it is happening. As other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously. And that means an increase incentive to do research and development  which benefits everyone in the world. Larger markets increase the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas  whether it's software  whether it's a computer chip  whether it's a new design. For the Hollywood people in the audience  this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies  it's because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures  so the market for those movies is larger. People are willing to invest more  and the budgets are larger. Alright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas  how do we maximize that incentive  It's by having one world market  by globalizing the world. The way I like to put this is  one idea. Ideas are meant to be shared  so one idea can serve one world  one market. One idea  one world  one market. Well how else can we create new ideas  That's one reason. Globalize trade. How else can we create new ideas  Well  more idea creators. Now idea creators  they come from all walks of life. Artists and innovators    many of the people you've seen on this stage. I'm going to focus on scientists and engineers because I have some data on that  and I'm a data person. Now  today  less than one tenth of one percent of the world's population are scientists and engineers. The United States has been an idea leader. A large fraction of those people are in the United States. But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership. And for that I am very grateful. That is a good thing. It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the United States  and a handful of other developed countries  have shouldered the entire burden of research and development. But consider the following  if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone  which are shared by everyone. I think of the great Indian mathematician  Ramanujan. How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields  barely able to feed themselves  when they could be feeding the world  Now we're not there yet. But it is going to happen in this century. The real tragedy of the last century is this  if you think about the world's population as a giant computer  a massively parallel processor  then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off line. But in this century China is coming on line. India is coming on line. Africa is coming on line. We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century. Here is just some data. This is China.       less than one million new university students in China per year        over five million. Now think what this means. This means we all benefit when another country gets rich. We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy. That is something that we should embrace    a wealthy China  a wealthy India  a wealthy Africa. We need a greater demand for ideas    those larger markets I was talking about earlier    and a greater supply of ideas for the world. Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic. Globalization is increasing the demand for ideas  the incentive to create new ideas. Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas. In fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism. From about the beginnings of humanity to       zero economic growth  nothing.      to       maybe a little bit of economic growth  but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today.     s  maybe one percent. Twentieth century  a little bit over two percent. Twenty first century could easily be  .   even higher percent. Even at that rate  by      average GDP per capita in the world will be         . That's not U.S. GDP per capita  which will be over a million  but world GDP per capita            . That's not that far. We won't make it. But some of our grandchildren probably will. And I should say  I think this is a rather modest prediction. In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy. In Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth. Alright what about problems  What about a great depression  Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression. Here is GDP per capita from      to     . Now let's imagine that you were an economist in       trying to forecast future growth for the United States  not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff  not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the   th century. What would you have predicted  not knowing this  If you had based your prediction  your forecast on      to      you'd have predicted something like this. If you'd been a little more optimistic    say  based upon the Roaring Twenties    you'd have said this. So what actually happened  We went off a cliff but we recovered. In fact in the second half of the   th century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted based upon the first half of the   th century. So growth can wash away even what appears to be a great depression. Alright. What else  Oil. Oil. This was a big topic. When I was writing up my notes oil was      per barrel. So people were asking a question. They were saying   Is China drinking our milkshake   And there is some truth to this  in the sense that we have something of a finite resource  and increased growth is going to push up demand for that. But I think I don't have to tell this audience that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing. Moreover  as everyone knows  look    it's energy  not oil  which counts. And higher oil prices mean a greater incentive to invest in energy R D. You can see this in the data. As oil prices go up  energy patents go up. The world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today  than ever in the past  because of what I'm talking about. One idea  one world  one market. So I'm optimistic so long as we hew to these two ideas  to keep globalizing world markets  keep extending cooperation across national boundaries  and keep investing in education. Now the United States has a particularly important role to play in this  to keep our education system globalized  to keep our education system open to students from all over the world  because our education system is the candle that other students come to light their own candles. Now remember here what Jefferson said. Jefferson said   When they come and light their candles at ours  they gain light  and we are not darkened.  But Jefferson wasn't quite right  was he  Because the truth is  when they light their candles at ours  there is twice as much light available for everyone. So my view is  Be optimistic. Spread the ideas. Spread the light. Thank you.,Economist,200904,6.11207581227,765401,TED2009,2009-02-07,20090207
alexa_meade,526,528,Alexa Meade 2013,Alexa Meade,female,Your body is my canvas,Sep 2013,410,You may want to take a closer look. There's more to this painting than meets the eye. And yes  it's an acrylic painting of a man  but I didn't paint it on canvas. I painted it directly on top of the man. What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether  and if I want to paint your portrait  I'm painting it on you  physically on you. That also means you're probably going to end up with an earful of paint  because I need to paint your ear on your ear. Everything in this scene  the person  the clothes  chairs  wall  gets covered in a mask of paint that mimics what's directly below it  and in this way  I'm able to take a three dimensional scene and make it look like a two dimensional painting. I can photograph it from any angle  and it will still look  D. There's no Photoshop here. This is just a photo of one of my three dimensional paintings. You might be wondering how I came up with this idea of turning people into paintings. But originally  this had nothing to do with either people or paint. It was about shadows. I was fascinated with the absence of light  and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed. I came up with the idea of painting shadows. I loved that I could hide within this shadow my own painted version  and it would be almost invisible until the light changed  and all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light. I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on  and I thought of my friend Bernie. But I didn't just want to paint the shadows. I also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale. I had a very specific vision of what this would look like  and as I was painting him  I made sure to follow that very closely. But something kept on flickering before my eyes. I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at. And then when I took that moment to take a step back  magic. I had turned my friend into a painting. I couldn't have foreseen that when I wanted to paint a shadow  I would pull out this whole other dimension  that I would collapse it  that I would take a painting and make it my friend and then bring him back to a painting. I was a little conflicted though  because I was so excited about what I'd found  but I was just about to graduate from college with a degree in political science  and I'd always had this dream of going to Washington  D.C.  and sitting at a desk and working in government. Why did this have to get in the way of all that  I made the tough decision of going home after graduation and not going up to Capitol Hill  but going down to my parents' basement and making it my job to learn how to paint. I had no idea where to begin. The last time I'd painted  I was    years old at summer camp  and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and practicing over and over again on that surface  because that's not what this project was about for me. It was about space and light. My early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas  like fried food. It's nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg. Even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit. It just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink. I'd put something down  and instantly it would be gone. And if I wanted to paint on people  well  I was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that I spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast. It just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself. One of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only didn't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his ears  but he also didn't really have much embarrassment about being taken out into very public places for exhibition  like the Metro. I was having so much fun with this process. I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles  and I wanted to see what else I could do with it. I came together with a collaborator  Sheila Vand  and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface  and that was milk. We got a pool. We filled it with milk. We filled it with Sheila. And I began painting. And the images were always completely unexpected in the end  because I could have a very specific image about how it would turn out  I could paint it to match that  but the moment that Sheila laid back into the milk  everything would change. It was in constant flux  and we had to  rather than fight it  embrace it  see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better. Sometimes  when Sheila would lay down in the milk  it would wash all the paint off of her arms  and it might seem a little bit clumsy  but our solution would be  okay  hide your arms. And one time  she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face. All right  well  hide your face. And we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined  even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands  just hiding them in the pockets. When we started out on the milk project  and when I started out  I couldn't have foreseen that I would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tripping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk. But then again  I guess it's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar  as long as you're willing to look beyond what's already been brought to light  that you can see what's below the surface  hiding in the shadows  and recognize that there can be more there than meets the eye.

alice_goffman_college_or_prison_two_destinies_one_blatant_injustice,963,965,Alice Goffman 2015,Alice Goffman,female,How we're priming some kids for college — and others for prison,May 2015,952,On the path that American children  travel to adulthood  two institutions oversee the journey. The first is the one we hear  a lot about  college. Some of you may remember the excitement that you felt when you first set off for college. Some of you may be in college right now and you're feeling this excitement at this very moment. College has some shortcomings. It's expensive  it leaves young people in debt. But all in all  it's a pretty good path. Young people emerge from college with pride and with great friends and with a lot of knowledge  about the world. And perhaps most importantly  a better chance in the labor market than they had before they got there. Today I want to talk about the second institution overseeing the journey from childhood to adulthood in the United States. And that institution is prison. Young people on this journey are meeting with probation officers instead of with teachers. They're going to court dates instead of to class. Their junior year abroad is instead a trip to a state correctional facility. And they're emerging from their   s not with degrees in business and English  but with criminal records. This institution is also costing us a lot  about        dollars a year to send a young person to prison in New Jersey. But here  taxpayers are footing the bill and what kids are getting is a cold prison cell and a permanent mark against them when they come home and apply for work. There are more and more kids on this journey to adulthood than ever before in the United States and that's because in the past    years  our incarceration rate  has grown by     percent. I have one slide for this talk. Here it is. Here's our incarceration rate  about     people per         in the population. Here's the OECD countries. What's more  it's poor kids that we're sending to prison  too many drawn from African American and Latino communities so that prison now stands firmly between the young people trying to make it and the fulfillment of the American Dream. The problem's actually  a bit worse than this 'cause we're not just sending  poor kids to prison  we're saddling poor kids with court fees  with probation and parole restrictions  with low level warrants  we're asking them to live  in halfway houses and on house arrest  and we're asking them  to negotiate a police force that is entering poor communities of color  not for the purposes  of promoting public safety  but to make arrest counts  to line city coffers. This is the hidden underside to our historic experiment in punishment  young people worried that at any moment  they will be stopped  searched and seized. Not just in the streets   but in their homes  at school and at work. I got interested in this  other path to adulthood when I was myself a college student attending the University of Pennsylvania in the early     s. Penn sits within a historic  African American neighborhood. So you've got these two parallel journeys going on simultaneously  the kids attending  this elite  private university  and the kids from  the adjacent neighborhood  some of whom are making it to college  and many of whom  are being shipped to prison. In my sophomore year  I started tutoring a young woman who was in high school who lived about    minutes away from the university. Soon  her cousin came home  from a juvenile detention center. He was     a freshman in high school. I began to get to know him  and his friends and family  and I asked him what he thought  about me writing about his life for my senior thesis in college. This senior thesis became a dissertation at Princeton and now a book. By the end of my sophomore year  I moved into the neighborhood and I spent the next six years trying to understand what young people were facing as they came of age. The first week I spent in this neighborhood  I saw two boys  five and seven years old  play this game of chase  where the older boy ran after the other boy. He played the cop. When the cop caught up to the younger boy  he pushed him down  handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs  took a quarter out of  the other child's pocket  saying   I'm seizing that.  He asked the child if  he was carrying any drugs or if he had a warrant. Many times  I saw this game repeated  sometimes children would  simply give up running  and stick their bodies flat  against the ground with their hands above their heads  or flat up against a wall. Children would yell at each other   I'm going to lock you up  I'm going to lock you up and you're never coming home   Once I saw a six year old child pull another child's pants down and try to do a cavity search. In the first    months that I lived in this neighborhood  I wrote down every time I saw any contact between police and people that were my neighbors. So in the first    months  I watched the police stop  pedestrians or people in cars  search people  run people's names  chase people through the streets  pull people in for questioning  or make an arrest every single day  with five exceptions. Fifty two times  I watched the police break down doors  chase people through houses or make an arrest of someone in their home. Fourteen times in this first year and a half  I watched the police punch  choke  kick  stomp on or beat young men after they had caught them. Bit by bit  I got to know two brothers  Chuck and Tim. Chuck was    when we met  a senior in high school. He was playing on the basketball team and making C's and B's. His younger brother  Tim  was   . And Tim loved Chuck  he followed him around a lot  looked to Chuck to be a mentor. They lived with their mom and grandfather in a two story row home  with a front lawn and a back porch. Their mom was struggling with addiction all while the boys were growing up. She never really was able  to hold down a job for very long. It was their grandfather's pension that supported the family  not really enough to pay for food and clothes and school supplies for growing boys. The family was really struggling. So when we met  Chuck was a senior in high school. He had just turned   . That winter  a kid in the schoolyard called Chuck's mom a crack whore. Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow and the school cops charged him  with aggravated assault. The other kid was fine the next day  I think it was his pride that was injured more than anything. But anyway  since Chuck was     this agg. assault case sent him  to adult county jail on State Road in northeast Philadelphia  where he sat  unable to pay the bail    he couldn't afford it    while the trial dates  dragged on and on and on through almost his entire senior year. Finally  near the end of this season  the judge on this assault case threw out most of the charges and Chuck came home with only a few hundred dollars' worth of court fees hanging over his head. Tim was pretty happy that day. The next fall  Chuck tried  to re enroll as a senior  but the school secretary told him that he was then    and too old  to be readmitted. Then the judge on his assault case issued him a warrant for his arrest because he couldn't pay  the     dollars in court fees that came due a few weeks after the case ended. Then he was a high school dropout living on the run. Tim's first arrest came later that year after he turned   . Chuck had managed to get his warrant lifted and he was on a payment plan for the court fees and he was driving Tim to school in his girlfriend's car. So a cop pulls them over  runs the car  and the car comes up  as stolen in California. Chuck had no idea where in the history of this car it had been stolen. His girlfriend's uncle bought it from a used car auction in northeast Philly. Chuck and Tim had never been outside of the tri state  let alone to California. But anyway  the cops down at the precinct charged Chuck with  receiving stolen property. And then a juvenile judge   a few days later  charged Tim  age     with accessory to receiving a stolen property and then he was placed on  three years of probation. With this probation sentence  hanging over his head  Chuck sat his little brother down and began teaching him how to run from the police. They would sit side by side  on their back porch looking out into the shared alleyway and Chuck would coach Tim how to spot undercover cars  how to negotiate a late night police raid  how and where to hide. I want you to imagine for a second what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like if they were living in a neighborhood where kids were going to college  not prison. A neighborhood like the one  I got to grow up in. Okay  you might say. But Chuck and Tim  kids like them  they're committing crimes  Don't they deserve to be in prison  Don't they deserve to be  living in fear of arrest  Well  my answer would be no. They don't. And certainly not for the same things  that other young people with more privilege are doing with impunity. If Chuck had gone to my high school  that schoolyard fight  would have ended there  as a schoolyard fight. It never would have become an aggravated assault case. Not a single kid that I went to college with has a criminal record right now. Not a single one. But can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class  Or had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night  Okay  you might say. But doesn't this high incarceration rate partly account for our  really low crime rate  Crime is down. That's a good thing. Totally  that is a good thing. Crime is down. It dropped precipitously in the '  s and through the     s. But according to a committee of academics convened by the National Academy of Sciences last year  the relationship between our historically high incarceration rates and our low crime rate is pretty shaky. It turns out that the crime rate goes up and down irrespective of how many young people we send to prison. We tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way  good and bad  innocent and guilty. Injustice is about being  wrongfully convicted. So if you're convicted  of something you did do  you should be punished for it. There are innocent and guilty people  there are victims and  there are perpetrators. Maybe we could think a little bit more broadly than that. Right now  we're asking kids who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods  who have the least amount of family resources  who are attending  the country's worst schools  who are facing the toughest time in the labor market  who are living in neighborhoods where violence is an everyday problem  we're asking these kids to walk the thinnest possible line    to basically never do anything wrong. Why are we not providing support to young kids facing these challenges  Why are we offering only handcuffs  jail time and this fugitive existence  Can we imagine something better  Can we imagine a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery  prevention  civic inclusion  rather than punishment  A criminal justice system  that acknowledges the legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the U.S. have faced and that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions. And finally  a criminal justice system that believes in black young people  rather than treating black young people  as the enemy to be rounded up. The good news is that we already are. A few years ago  Michelle Alexander wrote  The New Jim Crow   which got Americans to see  incarceration as a civil rights issue of historic proportions in a way they had not seen it before. President Obama and Attorney General  Eric Holder have come out very strongly on sentencing reform  on the need to address  racial disparity in incarceration. We're seeing states throw out Stop and Frisk as the civil rights violation that it is. We're seeing cities and states decriminalize possession of marijuana. New York  New Jersey and California have been dropping their  prison populations  closing prisons  while also seeing a big drop in crime. Texas has gotten into the game now  also closing prisons   investing in education. This curious coalition is building  from the right and the left  made up of former prisoners and fiscal conservatives  of civil rights activists and libertarians  of young people taking to the streets to protest police violence against unarmed black teenagers  and older  wealthier people    some of you are here in the audience    pumping big money into  decarceration initiatives In a deeply divided Congress  the work of reforming  our criminal justice system is just about the only thing that the right and the left are coming together on. I did not think I would see this political moment in my lifetime. I think many of the people who have been working tirelessly to write about the causes and consequences of our historically  high incarceration rates did not think we would see this moment in our lifetime. The question for us now is  how much can we make of it  How much can we change  I want to end with a call to young people  the young people attending college and the young people struggling to stay out of prison or to make it through prison and return home. It may seem like these paths to adulthood are worlds apart  but the young people participating in these two institutions conveying us to adulthood  they have one thing in common  Both can be leaders in the work of reforming our criminal justice system. Young people have always been leaders in the fight for equal rights  the fight for more people  to be granted dignity and a fighting chance at freedom. The mission for the generation  of young people coming of age in this  a sea change moment  potentially  is to end mass incarceration and  build a new criminal justice system  emphasis on the word justice.

alisa_miller_shares_the_news_about_the_news,1234,1236,Alisa Miller 2008,Alisa Miller,female,How the news distorts our worldview,May 2008,234,How does the news shape the way we see the world  Here's the world based on the way it looks    based on landmass. And here's how news shapes what Americans see. This map     Applause     this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories  by country  in February of         just one year ago. Now  this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities. There was massive flooding in Indonesia. And in Paris  the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming. The U.S. accounted for    percent of total news coverage. And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining    percent  we see a lot of Iraq    that's that big green thing there    and little else. The combined coverage of Russia  China and India  for example  reached just one percent. When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story  here's how the world looked. What was that story  The death of Anna Nicole Smith. This story eclipsed every country except Iraq  and received    times the coverage of the IPCC report. And the cycle continues  as we all know  Britney has loomed pretty large lately. So  why don't we hear more about the world  One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half. Aside from one person ABC mini bureaus in Nairobi  New Delhi and Mumbai  there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa  India or South America    places that are home to more than two billion people. The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper. And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news. Local TV news looms large  and unfortunately only dedicates    percent of its coverage to international news. And what about the web  The most popular news sites don't do much better. Last year  Pew and the Colombia J School analyzed the        stories that appeared on Google News' front page. And they  in fact  covered the same    news events. Similarly  a study in e content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters  and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it. So  if you put it all together  this could help explain why today's college graduates  as well as less educated Americans  know less about the world than their counterparts did    years ago. And if you think it's simply because we are not interested  you would be wrong. In recent years  Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over    percent. The real question  is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world  I know we can do better.

alison_jackson_looks_at_celebrity,876,878,Alison Jackson 2008,Alison Jackson,female,An unusual glimpse at celebrity,Jan 2008,1049,I'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums. I show a number of photographs and films  but I also make television programs  books and some advertising  all with the same concept. And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture  and the importance of the image  celebrity is born of photography. I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago  when Princess Diana died. There was a sort of a standstill in Britain the moment of her death  and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way. I was fascinated by this phenomenon  so I wondered  could one erase the image of Diana  actually quite crudely and physically  So  I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana  but I couldn't erase this from my memory and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche. Momentum was being built. The press wrote about her death in rather  I felt  pornographic ways    like   Which bit of artery left which bit of body   and  How did she die in the back of the car      and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism  so I made these rather gory images. I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image  so I got a look alike of Diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in  or existed in  the public imagination. So people were wondering  was she going to marry Dodi  Was she in love with him  Was she pregnant  Did she want his baby  Was she pregnant when she died  So I created this image of Diana  Dodi and their imaginary mixed race child and this image came out  which caused a huge public outcry at the time. I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery  so I started making reference to media imagery    made it grainy  shot through doorways and so on and so forth    to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism. So  this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband  and this was a sequence of images. And this gets shown in art galleries like this  as a sequence. And similarly with the Di Dodian baby imagery    this is another art gallery installation. I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception. This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs  for instance  but you think it's Camilla and the Queen  and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real. And the camera can lie  and it makes it very  very easy with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths. So  I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter. And at the same time  it removes us from the real subject matter  and this acts as a sort of titillating thing. So  the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism  what you can't have  you want more. In the photograph  the real subject doesn't exist so it makes you want that person more. And that is the way  I think  that celebrity magazines work now  the more pictures you see of these celebrities  the more you feel you know them  but you don't know them and you want to know them further. Of course  the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ... watch her horses.  Laughter . And then I was sort of making imagery. In England there's an expression   you can't imagine the Queen on the loo.  So I'm trying to penetrate that. Well  here is the image. All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and I was cited as a disgusting artist. The press were writing about this  giving full pages about how terrible this was. Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle  I was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media    because we don't know the real people  very few of us know the real people    but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing  effectively  my filthy work. So  these are broadsheets  tabloids  debates were being had all about this work  films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work  politicians were getting involved    all sorts of things    great headlines. Then suddenly  it started to get on front pages. I was being asked and paid to do front covers. Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable  which I found also fascinating. How one moment    it was disgusting    journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me  saying my work was wonderful  and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me. But then this changed suddenly. I then started to work for magazines and newspapers. This was  for example  an image that went into Tatler. This was another newspaper image. It was an April fool actually  and to this day some people think it's real. I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day  and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen sitting outside William Hill. They thought it was real. I was exploring  at the time  the hyperbole of icons    and Diana and Marilyn    and the importance of celebrity in our lives. How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing  and how that should happen. I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself. There's me as Diana    I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley  I think  in this one.  Laughter . And me as the Queen. I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn    the biggest icon of all    and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth  and only showing certain angles to create a reality that  obviously  is completely constructed. This is the look alike  so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous. She looks nothing like Marilyn  but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on  she looks exactly like Marilyn  to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her    or recognize this look alike    in these photographs  which I find quite interesting. So  all this work is getting shown in art galleries. Then I made a book. I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time. Stills from the TV series went into this book. But there was a real legal problem because it looks real  but how do you get over that  Because obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now  that we can't tell what's real. How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not  So  from my point of view  it's important to publish it  but at the same time it does cause a confusion    intentional on my behalf  but problematic for any outlet that I'm working with. So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do  and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities and comments about our public figures. You know  what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru  And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about Bin Laden  Saddam Hussein  the links that were put about pre Iraq war. And what is going to happen to the monarchy  Because obviously the British public  I think  would prefer William to Charles on the throne. And it's that wish  or that desire  that I suppose I'm dealing with in my work. I'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves. I'm interested in the perception of the celebrity. And with some look alikes  they are so good you don't know whether they're real or not. I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes  which is Coca Cola  and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities. It's highly commercial. But it was a difficulty for me    because this is my artwork  should I do advertising     at the time. So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same. But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on  you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that's all you're doing. When you take the logo off  you're opening up the interpretations and making the work inconclusive  opposed to conclusive when you are advertising. This image is quite interesting  actually  because I think we made it three years ago. And it's Camilla in her wedding dress  which  again  nearly got re used now  recently prior to her wedding. Tony Blair and Cherie. And again  the legalities    we had to be very careful. It's obviously a very big commercial company  and so this little   Shh    it's not really them   was put on the side of the imagery. And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail. I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them  so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes    live scenes with look alikes inside the windows  and the windows were all steamed up. So  it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech  I've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin  Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson  who he was having an affair with at that time. This was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper  broadsheets and tabloids. It was a bit of a road stopper  which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds  but huge fun    it was great for me to do a performance. Also  people were taking photographs of this  so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly  all this imagery. And the press were interviewing  and I was signing my book.  Laughter . Further imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschen that I'm working on really for a sort of global market    my previous book was only for the U.K. market    that I suppose it could be called humorous. I suppose I come from a sort of non humorous background with serious intent  and then suddenly my work is funny. And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous  in a way  I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery. It's an extremely fast way of getting information. It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly  and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery. This image  for example  is sort of spot on because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private  and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein  and George Bush reading the Koran upside down. For example  George Bush target practice    shooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore. And then you change the photograph he's shooting at  and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible.  Laughter . Tony Blair being used as a mounting block  and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind  and the seriousness  or the intellect  of Bush. And also  commenting on the behind the scenes    well  as we know now    what goes on in prisons. And in fact  George Bush and Tony Blair are having great fun during all of this. And really commenting  you know  based on the perception we have of the celebrities. What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life  and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage and golf clubbed a driver the other day. I mean  it's extremely difficult to find these look alikes  so I'm constantly going up to people in the street and trying to ask people to come and be in one of my photographs or films. And sometimes asking the real celebrity  mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person  which is highly embarrassing.  Laughter . I've also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis    a page a week in their newspaper    which has been very interesting  working topically. So  Jamie Oliver and school dinners  Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture  the whole of the hunting issue  and the royal family refusing to stop hunting  and the tsunami issues  and obviously Harry  Blair's views on Gordon Brown  which I find very interesting  Condi and Bush. This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it. I made it a year ago. And just how meanings change  and there were a terrible thing that has happened  but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that. That's why this image was made one year ago  and what it means today. So  I'll leave you with these clips to have a look.

allan_jones_a_map_of_the_brain,15,17,Allan Jones 2011,Allan Jones,male,A map of the brain,Nov 2011,902,Humans have long held a fascination for the human brain. We chart it  we've described it  we've drawn it  we've mapped it. Now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology    think Google Maps  think GPS    the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation. So let's take a look at the brain. Most people  when they first look at a fresh human brain  they say   It doesn't look what you're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain.  Typically  what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray. And this outer layer  this is the vasculature  which is incredible  around a human brain. This is the blood vessels.    percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs     percent of the blood pumped from your heart  is servicing this one organ. That's basically  if you hold two fists together  it's just slightly larger than the two fists. Scientists  sort of at the end of the   th century  learned that they could track blood flow to map non invasively where activity was going on in the human brain. So for example  they can see in the back part of the brain  which is just turning around there. There's the cerebellum  that's keeping you upright right now. It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement. On the side here  this is temporal cortex. This is the area where primary auditory processing    so you're hearing my words  you're sending it up into higher language processing centers. Towards the front of the brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought  decision making    it's the last to mature in late adulthood. This is where all your decision making processes are going on. It's the place where you're deciding right now you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner. So if you take a deeper look at the brain  one of the things  if you look at it in cross section  what you can see is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there. But there's actually a lot of structure there. It's cells and it's wires all wired together. So about a hundred years ago  some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells. And that's shown here in the the very light blue. You can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained. And what you can see is it's very non uniform. You see a lot more structure there. So the outer part of that brain is the neocortex. It's one continuous processing unit  if you will. But you can also see things underneath there as well. And all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through. They're probably less cell dense. So there's about    billion neurons in our brain. And as you can see  they're very non uniformly distributed. And how they're distributed really contributes to their underlying function. And of course  as I mentioned before  since we can now start to map brain function  we can start to tie these into the individual cells. So let's take a deeper look. Let's look at neurons. So as I mentioned  there are    billion neurons. There are also these smaller cells as you'll see. These are support cells    astrocytes glia. And the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input. They're storing it  they're processing it. Each neuron is connected via synapses to up to        other neurons in your brain. And each neuron itself is largely unique. The unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry. These are proteins. They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement. They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with. And they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do. So if we zoom in to an even deeper level  all of those proteins are encoded by our genomes. We each have    pairs of chromosomes. We get one from mom  one from dad. And on these chromosomes are roughly        genes. They're encoded in the DNA. And the nature of a given cell driving its underlying biochemistry is dictated by which of these        genes are turned on and at what level they're turned on. And so our project is seeking to look at this readout  understanding which of these        genes is turned on. So in order to undertake such a project  we obviously need brains. So we sent our lab technician out. We were seeking normal human brains. What we actually start with is a medical examiner's office. This a place where the dead are brought in. We are seeking normal human brains. There's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains. We want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of    to     they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain  no history of psychiatric disease  no drugs on board    we do a toxicology workup. And we're very careful about the brains that we do take. We're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue  we can get consent to take the tissue within    hours of time of death. Because what we're trying to measure  the RNA    which is the readout from our genes    is very labile  and so we have to move very quickly. One side note on the collection of brains  because of the way that we collect  and because we require consent  we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains. Males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life. And men are much more likely to have their significant other  spouse  give consent than the other way around. So the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what's called an MR. This is magnetic resonance imaging    MRI. It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data. So we collect this MR. And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map. The next thing we do is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging. This maps the large cabling in the brain. And again  you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways  if you will. The brain is removed from the skull  and then it's sliced into one centimeter slices. And those are frozen solid  and they're shipped to Seattle. And in Seattle  we take these    this is a whole human hemisphere    and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer. There's a blade here that's going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide. We're going to then apply one of those stains to it  and we scan it. And then what we get is our first mapping. So this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments. You could consider this state boundaries  if you will  those pretty broad outlines. From this  we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces  which then we can put on a smaller cryostat. And this is just showing this here    this frozen tissue  and it's being cut. This is    microns thin  so this is about a baby hair's width. And remember  it's frozen. And so you can see here  old fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied. We take a microscope slide. Then we very carefully melt onto the slide. This will then go onto a robot that's going to apply one of those stains to it. And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this. So again this is what they can see under the microscope. You can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places. And from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments. And they can make basically what's a reference atlas. This is a more detailed map. Our scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what's called laser scanning microdissection. So the technician takes the instructions. They scribe along a place there. And then the laser actually cuts. You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off. You can see on the microscope slide here  that's what's happening in real time. There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue. We take that tissue  we purify the RNA out of it using some basic technology  and then we put a florescent tag on it. We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray. Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you  but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass. This has roughly        elements on it  so we repeatedly measure various genes of the        genes in the genome. And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it  we get a unique fingerprint  if you will  quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample. Now we do this over and over again  this process for any given brain. We're taking over a thousand samples for each brain. This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus. It's involved in learning and memory. And it contributes to about    samples of those thousand samples. So each sample gets us about        data points with repeat measurements  a thousand samples. So roughly  we have    million data points for a given human brain. We've done right now two human brains worth of data. We've put all of that together into one thing  and I'll show you what that synthesis looks like. It's basically a large data set of information that's all freely available to any scientist around the world. They don't even have to log in to come use this tool  mine this data  find interesting things out with this. So here's the modalities that we put together. You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before. Here's the MR. It provides the framework. There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn  it allows you to zoom in  it allows you to highlight individual structures. But most importantly  we're now mapping into this anatomic framework  which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on. So the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree. Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on. And each gene gives us a fingerprint. And remember that we've assayed all the        genes in the genome and have all of that data available. So what can scientists learn about this data  We're just starting to look at this data ourselves. There's some basic things that you would want to understand. Two great examples are drugs  Prozac and Wellbutrin. These are commonly prescribed antidepressants. Now remember  we're assaying genes. Genes send the instructions to make proteins. Proteins are targets for drugs. So drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off  etc. So if you want to understand the action of drugs  you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to  and also in the ways you don't want them to. In the side effect profile  etc.  you want to see where those genes are turned on. And for the first time  we can actually do that. We can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too. So now we can look throughout the brain. We can see this unique fingerprint. And we get confirmation. We get confirmation that  indeed  the gene is turned on    for something like Prozac  in serotonergic structures  things that are already known be affected    but we also get to see the whole thing. We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before  and we see these genes turned on there. It's as interesting a side effect as it could be. One other thing you can do with such a thing is you can  because it's a pattern matching exercise  because there's unique fingerprint  we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint. So if you're in drug discovery  for example  you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize. Most of you are probably familiar with genome wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying   Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect X.  And so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they're great. They analyze large populations. They look at their entire genomes  and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked causally to genes. But what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes. It tells you the what  but it doesn't tell you the where. And so it's very important for those researchers that we've created this resource. Now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity. They can start to look at common pathways    other things that they simply haven't been able to do before. So I think this audience in particular can understand the importance of individuality. And I think every human  we all have different genetic backgrounds  we all have lived separate lives. But the fact is our genomes are greater than    percent similar. We're similar at the genetic level. And what we're finding is actually  even at the brain biochemical level  we are quite similar. And so this shows it's not    percent  but it's roughly    percent correspondence at a reasonable cutoff  so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated. And then we find some outliers  some things that lie beyond the cloud. And those genes are interesting  but they're very subtle. So I think it's an important message to take home today that even though we celebrate all of our differences  we are quite similar even at the brain level. Now what do those differences look like  This is an example of a study that we did to follow up and see what exactly those differences were    and they're quite subtle. These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type. These are two genes that we found as good examples. One is called RELN    it's involved in early developmental cues. DISC  is a gene that's deleted in schizophrenia. These aren't schizophrenic individuals  but they do show some population variation. And so what you're looking at here in donor one and donor four  which are the exceptions to the other two  that genes are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells. It's this dark purple precipitate within the cell that's telling us a gene is turned on there. Whether or not that's due to an individual's genetic background or their experiences  we don't know. Those kinds of studies require much larger populations. So I'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go. I think these resources are incredibly valuable. They give researchers a handle on where to go. But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point. We're certainly going to be looking at more. I'll just close by saying that the tools are there  and this is truly an unexplored  undiscovered continent. This is the new frontier  if you will. And so for those who are undaunted  but humbled by the complexity of the brain  the future awaits. Thanks.,Brain scientist,201111,6.05787593985,1060496,TEDGlobal 2011,2011-07-13,20110713
